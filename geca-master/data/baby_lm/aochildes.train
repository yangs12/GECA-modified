and then the fifth one i did it six .
for our anniversary .

eric's mother gave them a tool box to put the tools in .
it was too heavy to carry so they put the box into jane's wagon !
let's use our tools to help our neighbors !
eric suggested !
that's a good idea ?
said jane and they started off pulling the wagon down the sidewalk together .
miss campbell had just finished putting up a new mailbox when jane and eric reached her house .
they showed her all the things in their tool box and miss campell asked if they would use their paint and brushes to decorate her mailbox ?
eric and jane painted it white with bright blue stripes .
miss campell was very pleased !

and in and out of weeks and almost over a year to where the wild things are .

do you think they're scary ?
do you think they're funny ?
till max said be still .
and tamed them with the magic trick of staring into their yellow eyes without blinking once .
and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing of all .

and they danced by the light of the moon .
and they hung from the trees .
and they had their wild thing parade .
now stop max said and sent the wild things to bed without their supper .
and max the king of all wild things was lonely .
and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all .
and all around from far away across the world he smelled good things to eat ?
so he gave up being king of where the wild things are ?
but the wild things cried oh please don't go we'll eat you up we love you so .
and max said no ?
the wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws .
but max stepped into his private boat and waved goodbye .
bye bye .
and sailed back over a year and in and out of weeks and through a day .
and into the night of his very own room where he found his supper waiting for him .

lily loved school .
she loved the pointy pencils she loved the squeaky chalk and she loved the way her boots went clickety clickety click down the long shiny halls ?
lily loved the privacy of her very own desk .
and she loved the fish sticks and chocolate milk every friday in the lunch room .
and most of all she loved her teacher mister slinger .
mister slinger was sharp as a tack ?
he wore artistic shirts and glasses on a chain around his neck .
and he wore a different colored tie for each day of the week .
mhm and what color's this one .
right .
wow said lily .
that was about all she could say wow .
instead of greetings students or good morning pupils mister slinger winked and said howdy ?
he thought that desks in rows were old fashioned and boring .
do you rodents think you can handle a semicircle ?
and he always provided the most tasty snacks ?
things that were curly and crunchy and cheesy .
i wanna be a teacher when i grow up said lily .
me too said her friends .
what's on your book ?
really .
maybe some crayon ?
oh .
we'll have to try and clean that off ?
oh thank you .
oh very nice thanks honey .
at home lily pretended to be mister slinger ?
i'm the teacher she told her baby brother julius listen up .
lily even wanted her encyclopedias .
what's with lily asked her mother ?
i thought she wanted to be a surgeon or an ambulance driver or a diva said her father .
it must be because of her new teacher mister slinger said her mother .
she's pretending to be mister slinger .
uh here she is ?
that's her here !
whenever the students had free time they were permitted to go to the light bulb lab in the back of the classroom ?
huh i don't know it must be other kids in her class ?
that's julius .
over there .
these are other students in her class .
when mister slinger had bus duty lily stood in line even though she didn't ride the bus ?
she raised her hand more than anyone in the class even if she didn't know the answer .
and she volunteered to stay after school to clap erasers .
you're right he is wearing a yellow tie ?
one monday morning lily came to school especially happy ?
she had three shiny quarters and best of all she had a brand new purple plastic purse that played a jaunty tune when it was opened .
lily wanted to show everyone .
not now said mister slinger listen to our story .
lily had a hard time listening .
she really wanted to show everyone .
not now said mister slinger let's be considerate of our classmates ?
right ?
she's giving a haircut to julius .
oh let's see it looks like she maybe she's a pilot there she's flying ?
oh she's a doctor there .
she's a ballerina there .
she's a scuba diver ?
she's a diva singing ?
an ambulance driver .

the purple crayon book .
yes .
one evening after thinking it over for some time harold decided to go for a walk in the moonlight .
there wasn't any moon and harold needed a moon for a walk in the moonlight .
and he needed something to walk on .
he made a long straight path so he wouldn't get lost .
and he set off on his walk taking his big purple crayon with him ?
but he didn't seem to be getting anywhere on the long straight path so he left the path for a shortcut across a field .
and the moon went with him .
the shortcut led right to where harold thought a forest ought to be ?
he didn't want to get lost in the woods so he made a very small forest ?
how many trees are in this forest ?
yeah just one tree .
yeah just one ?
it turned out to be an apple tree ?
the apples would be very tasty when they got red howard thought .
uh oh .
he put a frightening dragon under the tree to guard the apples .
he is going to scare harold .
it was a terribly frightening dragon .
it frightened harold and he backed away .
his hand holding the purple crayon shook ?
suddenly he realized what was happening but by then harold was over his head in an ocean .
he drew water .
but he came up thinking fast and in no time he was climbing aboard a trim little boat ?
he quickly set sail ?
ooh boy that's annoying huh ?
op it's gone ?
i think it was a car alarm .
what do you think ?
it was a car .
yeah i think so .
he quickly set sail and the moon sailed with him .
after he had sailed long enough harold made land without too much trouble .
he stepped ashore on the beach wondering where he was .
the sandy beach reminded harold of picnics and the thought of picnics made him hungry .
so he laid out a nice simple picnic lunch ?
there was nothing but .
pie .
but there were all nine kinds of pie that harold liked best .
when harold finished his picnic there was quite a lot left ?
he hated to see so much delicious pie go to waste .
so he left a very hungry .
moose and a deserving ?
porcupine to finish it up .
and off he went looking for a hill to climb to see where he was .
he knew that the higher up he went the farther he could see .
oh he's climbing up the mountain to see if he can find his bedroom .
oh he is .
let's see .
he hoped he could see the bedroom from the top of the mountain ?
oh ?
he looked down over the other side and he fell off .
there wasn't any other side to the mountain .
he was falling into ?
thin air .
but luckily he kept his wits and his purple crayon ?
and he made a hot air balloon and grabbed on .
he made a basket under the balloon big enough to stand in .
he had a fine view from the balloon but he couldn't see his window .
he couldn't even see his house ?
so he made a house with windows and landed the balloon on the grass in the front yard .
none of the windows was his window though .
he tried to think where his window ought to be ?
oh it must be in back of the house i bet it's back behind the house right .
yeah .
he made some more windows .
he made a big building full of windows .
he made lots of buildings full of windows .
he made a whole city of windows .
but none of the windows was his window .
and he couldn't think where it might be .
he decided to ask a policeman .
the policeman pointed the way harold was going anyway but harold thanked him .
and he walked along with the moon wishing he was in his room and in his bed .
then .
he remembered .
he remembered where his bedroom window was when there was a moon .
it was always right around the moon .
yeah the window is right around the moon .
then harold made his bed and got in and drew up the covers .
the purple crayon dropped on the floor and harold ?
dropped off to sleep .
very good sweetie ?
very good ?
yeah you did .
yeah .
where did you watch harold ?
harold was on tv ?
really .
in our house .
oh .

meh .
he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swings ?
but franklin had a problem ?
what was franklin's problem ?
right ?
he couldn't ride his bike without his training wheels right ?
right .
in the spring all of franklin's friends had training wheels on their bikes ?
beaver was the brave one ?
she took her extra wheels off first ?
she practiced and practiced and then went to the park to show off ?
look at me she said i can ride my bike all by myself .
franklin watched beaver ride around in circles .
who's that ?
rabbit and who's that ?
bear ?
right ?
it wasn't long before beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handle bar with the other .
soon everyone but franklin could ride without training wheels ?
we're going on a picnic said bear come on .
franklin was worried that his friends would make fun of his training wheels .
so he lied and said i'm not hungry and went home to eat lunch alone ?
aw ?
poor franklin ?
what's franklin doing in this picture ?
what's he doing here ?
what's he doing there ?
is he on the slide .
he's on the swing you're right ?
afterwards franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike .
he wanted to ride all by himself .
he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push .
franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered and fell into the flower bed ?
i can't do it he said i'm never riding this bike again .
aw .
poor franklin .
for the rest of the week franklin felt left out .
he watched as his friends rode off without him .
they were becoming great explorers on their bikes ?
what are they doing ?
what kind of ice cream are they eating ?
you don't know .
what do you think .
what's your favorite kind of ice cream ?
really .
do you like vanilla ?
you like chocolate ice cream .
mm .
in an ice cream cone that sounds great .
you like strawberry too .
mm what color is strawberry ice cream ?
orange i think strawberry ice cream is pink ?
see ?
see i think maybe that's strawberry .
that's strawberry right .
yeah i don't have any though ?
i'm sorry to say !
maybe we can go later to get ice cream what do you think ?
okay ?
on saturday franklin's friends zoomed by his house ?
that looks like fun said franklin's mother ?
i can't ride without my training wheels groaned franklin ?
aw franklin's pretty sad ?
did you give it your best effort asked his mother ?
well said franklin ?
hm let's see ?
it looks like some little schmutz maybe from your granola bar ?
well ?
your granola bar has a raspberry center so maybe that's what it was .
what sweetie ?
you wanna sip ?
yes ?
ah .
that tastes delicious right ?
strawberry water ?
you're silly .
you gave me a kiss on the head .
you know what .
i love you .
i love your kisses ?
are you hiding .
yes .
yes i can ?
well said franklin maybe i can try one more time ?
franklin sat on his bike it's tippy he said .
his mother held on to the seat .
try it i won't let you go until you tell me to .
franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bike from behind .
he felt unsteady and very unsure .
i'm going to fall he said and stopped pedaling .
riding a bike is difficult said his mother .
but you can't give up just because it's frustrating ?
it's too hard for me said franklin ?
it was easy for my friends ?
do you think everything comes easy for them she asked ?
franklin had to think about that ?
oh you're right he is riding his bicycle ?
franklin went to the park ?
he saw beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars ?
each time she got to the third rung she fell into the sand below .
no beaver said bear do it like this it's easy .
easy for you said beaver she tried once more and fell again .
maybe tomorrow she grumbled .
franklin remembered when badger learned to swim .
she was afraid to put her head underwater ?
it's easy said franklin just do it .
badger sputtered and cried .
it took her a long time to feel good in the water ?
now she could swim from one end of the pond to the other .
where is snail ?
i don't think snail is in this book .
snail's in the other book .
snail's at the museum right .
in the other book .
maybe that would help me stop coughing what do you think .
let's look over .
here .
you wanna pretend to eat one ?
let's see .
pretend to eat one .
mommy's gonna have one of these .
yeah ?
but honey you can't really eat it because it's dangerous for a little girl to eat hard candy .
right .
maybe you'd like something else to eat ?
can you pretend with the wrapper on then ?
it's gonna make your hand all sticky .
really .
no .
no .
hello .
really .
hm ?
okay .
in my mouth ?
can i get you something else to eat ?
hm ?
there's a blue one .
looks like a blue wrapper to me .
mm hm .
you have to untwist the top first sweetie .
mhm other way .
yep just like that .
wait .
just like that like put your hand on it ?
hm like that .
turn that around .
just like this .
good job sweetie look .
just a twist like that .
right ?
just like that .
exactly .
mhm .
maybe you don't wanna hold it .
maybe you wanna put it back in the wrapper .
hm ?
your hand's gonna get all sticky .
hm don't eat it .
good pretending .
franklin thought about the first time fox played baseball .
he couldn't hit the ball at all .
but he tried and tried until one day fox got a home run .
who's that ?
porcupine .
just then porcupine came by .
she moved very slowly .
she pointed to the pads on her knees wrists and elbows .
they make me feel funny she said but they keep me safe ?
that's it cried franklin and hurried home !
oh i think porcupine's nice now .
don't you think porcupine's nice ?
the bear .
aha .
no the bear's franklin's friend !
they're all nice animals .
mhm .
yep porcupine's nice .
badger is nice .
and bear is nice and franklin is nice .
mm that's not badger who is that .

oh beaver sorry that's beaver .
beaver .
what's beaver doing ?
what's beaver playing with ?
is he on the swing ?
he's in the sandbox wow neat ?
that's great ?
franklin put on padding ?
he lined the walk with old pillows ?
i'm ready to try again franklin told his mother ?
now i won't worry if i fall .
franklin sat on his bike and his mother held on to the seat .
franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered and fell many times but he never gave up .
then it happened .
franklin told his mother to let go .
he didn't veer into the bushes and he didn't crash .
way to go cheered his mother .
careful honey .
franklin was thrilled .
finally he was riding his bike all by himself .
i can do it he shouted and rode to the park to show his friends .
look at me he called .
franklin tried to signal with one hand like beaver but he toppled over .
i think i'll work on that he laughed .
not everything is as easy at it looks .
hm where is it .

little bunny's baby sister goes in her diaper .
little bunny used to but not anymore .
she's making a face ?
because of the smell .
right .
she doesn't like the smell .
hm ?
the mommy is .
changing the baby's diaper .
oh she's probably worried about the baby getting a diaper rash .
because when you wear a diaper instead of using a potty you can get a diaper rash .
why did you tear it off .
i have no idea do you remember why .
i don't know why .
now when little bunny has to go it's potty time ?
she pulls down her pants and lifts the lid ?
she can probably pull down her own big kid pants !
after little bunny goes it's time to wipe !
want me to read the little book .
time to use the potty !
sit sit sit i sit and wait .
turn the page .
then it says .
time to wipe !
yippee i used the potty !
little bunny sits on the potty and goes .
after little bunny goes it's time to wipe .
hm what's there .
time to wash and dry those hands while mommy pours the pee pee in the toilet .
then it's time to flush .
whoosh ?
bye bye pee pee !
oh okay .
did you skip a flap .
what's in ?
the box .
what's in her box ?
big kid pants !
there was a flap there it's not there anymore !
you tore it off !
when you were ?
a younger toddler !
because maybe you didn't understand that you shouldn't tear flaps off of flap books .
i don't know there must have been a flap there too ?
do you remember when there was stickers on this ?
you know if you wanted to you could get .
we could get some .
potty stickers and we could put them there .
but start putting them there instead of !
see because that potty poster is almost full .
we could use this again .
we could a .
we could get a bunch of maybe the !
we could get a bunch of small stickers that would fit over the numbers !
and you could use this again !
would you like to do that .
well i mean one that wouldn't be too big .
we wouldn't want one that would be .
that would cover up more than one number ?
maybe i could find some .
that you could use .
that would be the right size .
and we could even take it with us when we go on our journey and that way you could have potty stickers on your journey .
should we take a potty with us on our journey .
yeaah .
maybe because she's too short and he's tall enough to reach ?
which potty do you think we should take with us on the journey should we take this potty seat and leave these two at home ?
okay we could bring the bunny potty ?
should we bring the seat too maybe .
this one .
should we bring a stool with us .
oh i see .
when we go on our journey ?
at the vacation house .
do you wanna use this one ?
alright .
okay i think you're ready to wipe aren't you ?
that's the end of the book .
oh alright !
go ahead then .
you know if your tummy ever hurts like that again .
your stomach ?
then you'll know that maybe it's time to use the potty !
you came to me and you said my tummy is hurting ?
and i said sometimes that means you need to use the potty .
and i was right .
that's number thirteen .
this whole thing ?
it's toilet paper .
twenty nine ?
twenty eight ?
those are numbers .
twenty seven .
twenty six .
twenty five ?
twenty four .

nina if you want to use water you let me get it because you got the whole bath room wet before .
here .
okay ?
well honey you know what .
it's all let me tell you .
okay i'll tell you how you can do it .
if you take this i'm gonna bring a little pot and we can wash right here .
because that floor is all wet already ?
so here's the wet wash cloth .
and i'll make a little pot ?
and we can make a bath tub for the dolly .
okay .
i'll get a little pot .
we're gonna use a little pot .
but we don't wanna get we don't wanna get too much water on the floor as you did this morning .
so here we go .
let's be careful not to spill much water on the floor .
put her in the middle .
you can use this to shampoo her with .
like i use for you .
well where is the other one ?
you had two ?
where did you put the other one ?
you put it away somewhere .
remember ?
wait a minute ?
you opened one .
in a box i think .

look in that box .
i bet you put it in that box over there .
with the black and white spots on it ?
find it ?
find it ?
so how are you going to wash her hair now ?
the last one ?
she doesn't need any more then that ?
okay ?
now you give her a good bath .
get her all clean .
aha ?
that's a syringe .
i used to use that when you were a little baby when you had ear trouble ?
aha .
that's that's her when you have an ear ache ?
you can use that for a bottle of shampoo ?
here let's pretend to put the shampoo in here ?
okay it's all full of shampoo .
that's the shampoo bottle .

you keep keep the dolly in there and i'll bring a bucket in with some water .
there that's enough water now .
no that's plenty .
she'll drown otherwise .
because there'll be too much water .
you don't fill the bath tub up over your neck do you .
that's enough because you know what would happen .
it would spill all over the rug .
and then we'd have one big wet rug .
i usually fill the bath tub half way up ?
just like that pot ?
there's about as much .
i'll put some of this in here ?
like this pour it into the bowl ?
here we go ?
want all the water in the bowl .
okay be careful .

and all the glue's coming off .
don't leave it in the water so long okay ?
okay but don't leave the stickers in the water so long and we won't need to tape them okay ?
no i think that's enough see ?
it stayed on .
aha .
no that doesn't need to be blotted .
it doesn't have any excess water does it ?
aha .
look and see .
that's right .
why ?
probably because you forgot to do something .
you tell me .
no what about putting it in the bowl ?

those are for another page .
those stickers are for another page .
we do one page at a time .
right here see ?

what kind of pies do you like to eat abe ?
you like cakes better than pies ?
okay what do you think mickey mouse is doing ?

remember when we were in pennsylvania and we played in a haystack ?
who's doing that ?
oh .
who said that ?
for your paddle ?
nope they were all out .
but they said we could come back another time .

i think that one's called a ram .
and make your paddle ?
we have to wait until the wood comes in okay ?
billygoats don't have that much fur on them .
are you getting tired ?
this will be the last page okay ?
this is hard work isn't it ?
aha .
i'd say .
abe what are you doing ?
and i'd say .
you must be having a hard time going to sleep .
what else did ernie count ?
what happened then ?
the whole neighborhood ?
what do you say ?
okay .
let's find the dotted lines .
that's right .
is that even on the right page ?
i think you're being silly .
of course .
as soon as you finish these stickers .
you still have a few more to put on .
oh sure .
i am ?
why ?
i got up when you got up .
i wasn't ready to get up .
what does it look like ?

i think you did .
hey you're too rough .
that wasn't my knee .
okay know what abe and i are going to do ?
we're going to get a big piece of paper .
and abe can lie on it .
and we'll draw an outline of his body .
sounds like a good idea to me .
abe daddy can throw you up on the ceiling .
so you can stick on the big piece of paper .
and i could get a marker and mark around you .
why not ?
what will i say ?
can you show me what's inside here ?
oh i thought it was nothing but it is ?
chalk what do you do with it ?
do you want to draw with it ?
is that your chalkboard ?
i have a chalkboard too ?

a mountain .
it is looking like a mountain .
that's pretty good sweety ?
you know what i noticed what were these from .
your hands i know look at that ?
but when did you put those on there ?
it looks like your hands were dirty .
or what do you think was on your hands that made these spots on the chalkboard .
i'm not sure either .
well see now what should we play with .
you got these all for me ?
you got them all for you ?
where did you get them ?
oh actually .
see that silver one came from the ground .
what else does this remind you of that we also have at home ?

the red matches the red on your sweater .
the red shoes matches the red design .

well we can't we shouldn't probably take the toys into the park .
but you can take them in the car and hold them in the car .
so i have to wear white shoes .
well we don't have any white shoes but we have red shoes .
i think these'll be okay don't you .

look at her pretty eyes .
they open and shut .

uh huh ?

oh i don't think they're gonna be two extras .
well because there aren't enough uh pieces ?
there are lots of pieces but there's only one extra piece .
there used to be two but remember we lost one so now there's only one extra .
do you wanna play dominoes instead ?
that's a flag like on a castle .
how's that ?
yes .

where you going ?
oh .
yeah what do you think of this crab .
right .
except he has short arms .
yes .
yes .
one blue and one .
he needs an orange .
oh well i built his head like that which has the orange one .
should i change that .
okay .
well he doesn't always have to look like he looks in the book .
you know but we can change that .
see the problem is we're missing one of these white ones .
oh i see how they did it okay .
so his his arms are gonna be a little short okay .
and we're missing an orange piece too .
so we don't have that last orange piece .
so we have to build it with some different pieces .
yes .
yes honey .
alright .
wow what do you have there ?
you sure like making that sword ?
heh you uh .
uh huh .
whoa ?
oh goodness alright .
oh the fireball is coming .
yes .
oh yeah there's another orange piece .
that's right .
you know we're still missing that this one of those white ones though ?
so if you see one of these white ones around .
we should put it back in the box .
but we can still make a lot of other things without it .
i don't know maybe it's upstairs .
but we'll look for it later .
well maybe it's under .
maybe it's under the table .
you see it .
no .
okay .
that's alright we can build lots of things without it .
like we can build this ?
we can build this fish .
sort of a a fish and a crab .
yeah .
yes .
you did you found that little missing piece ?
now it's one on one foot .
wow ?
yeah .
i don't know .
i just threw some pieces together .
it's right there .
your welcome .
sure .
okay .
yeah yeah .
huh ?
well we could take a piece off of him .
off of this guy ?
if you want ?
the squiggly thing .
this one .
okay but if we put that in then we can't attach ?
yeah there's no place for the .
but we can take one of these blue ones .
put that in there .
whoa ?
i see .
i think that's pretty neat .
um well .
maybe it's a swordfish .
because this kind of looks like a sword .
the bottom part .
this is a funny looking swordfish .
what do you think ?
a sword dolphin .
you wanna make him even taller ?
here let's try this ?
we can put .
well we can put some more legs on him ?
so he's nice and stable ?
thanks .
then we can ?
put some more ?
pegs to make him taller ?
even taller .
yeah that's a tough one to get out ?
sure .
i'll help you .
you know what the best way to do it is .
put your fingers like this ?
you hold it like this ?
and .
push .
push it out like this .
oh sorry .
okay .
yeah that's pretty hard .
yeah mom will get it .
whoa ?
alright .
yeah that's right ?
oh ?
yeah it does .
whoa ?
tip it over .
sure okay .
yeah maybe we should put the red part down below .
that'll make it more stable ?
okay let's try that ?
the red one here .
we'll do it from .
biggest to smallest okay .
so we get the red one now we're gonna have the yellow one .
and .
the blue ones come next ?
because they're the next biggest ?
then we'll have the orange ones .
i'll have all the orange ones ?
is that alright .
well .
well looks likes it's standing up pretty well .
now do you want one eye or two eyes .
two eyes ?
can you put that off ?

we've got another little .
another little peg .

put that right over there .
now you come over here and sit with me and we'll see if we .
ow !
my foot !
i see what this is all about .
the great cat chase .
let me see .
hm .
aha isn't that a riot ?
no .
i'd say that's a little girl .
and she looks like she's dressed up in her some of her mother's clothes or something .
she's got on high heels and a pocket book .
does that look like somebody i know ?
who get likes to get dressed up ?
i can not imagine .
somebody named ursula ann ?
she's giving her kittie cat a little ride in the carriage huh ?
oh oh !
look what happened .
she's bending over to pick a very pretty flower and the cat doesn't like the ride .
cats don't usually like to ride too well so he's trying to run out of the carriage when she's not looking .
she turns around and she goes .
oh no .
she sees the blanket on the ground and the cat's gone .
course he knows where she is he's peeking at her from behind the tree .
she runs off to get a policeman because she can not find her cat .
she's really kind of worried .
and she finds a policeman .
and .
there's a little body she oh .
i don't know she probably says .
oh dear oh dear my cat has run away and i can not find him .
the policeman puts up his hand .
see he's saying .
stop .
oop .
they turn around and there's the cat sitting right there looking at them .
they probably feel kinda foolish now cause they thought he was missing and he wasn't at all .
so they say .
here kittie kittie kittie .
kittie kittie .
cat doesn't want to be caught you know .
they don't like to be .
he's looking at them as if to say .
well you catch me if you can .
and there .
whoop ?
the policeman tries to reach him and he can not .
he falls over .
the little boy's laughing .
and the little girl's very angry .
she's kinda disgusted with him that he can not couldn't catch the cat .
so they're still calling him and they're walking after the cat to try to catch him .
an the cat's looking back at them .
he's gonna go through this big pipe .
and he's probably gonna hide on them .
i would imagine .
oh no !
look at this .
he crawled into there and he's gonna make all of them crawl through there to catch him .
look at him .
he's peeking in to see where they are .
oh isn't that funny ?
look at the man .
well it's really a boy dressed up .
but he's gonna fall onto the end an there's water down there .
they're not gonna like that too well .
he falls in the water and he helps the little girl out .
the cat in the meantime is watching .
he's probably having a real ball watching them fall in .
oh no look at that he fell right in the h in head first into the water .
now .
now there he goes back in the pipe again .
oh they're so mad now .
oh no that was clever .
see the little boy ?
he was sitting at the other end waiting and he got the kittie when he came out .
he lost him .
there he is hopping on that little boy's head .
oh they must be furious with that cat huh ?
now he's gonna climb the tree .
now they're gonna have a great time getting him out of the tree .
he climbs up the tree .
the kittie cat's hanging on by one limb grabs a hold of him .
whoops there goes the branch ?
it's ready to crack .
oh oh .
there it goes snap !
he's fallen down .
you think that's funny ?
well the branch wasn't strong enough to hold him so he's gonna fall .
thud right on the ground .
well they're all kinda battered and bruised and they're tired of trying to find that cat .
there he .
look at him .
he's walking along behind just as like nothing happened .
proud as can be .
no i think he's kinda tired out so they put him in the carriage i guess .
i know he's awfully tired .
look at him .
he ca he's sitting down resting .
and the little girl .
i do not know what she's up to .
oh she says .
wait a minute .
and she goes in the house and she comes out with some iced tea and cookies .
oh !
she figures they need a little refreshment after trying to catch that kittie cat huh ?
they all look rather happy don't they ?
i think you know what we ought to do ?
i think we ought to try an put this car back together again .
the way we found it .
anything to .
would i like any fresh tea ?
oh !

for melanie ?
okay .
mhm .
mhm .
mm that's a pretty good little little shelf to put things in there .
yeah .
you ought to have something like this at home .
that would be fun .
and you could have a little general .
store of your own .
that'd be nice .
that's to wash the baby's clothes with see ?
ivory snow .
soft to make baby's clothing very soft .
that's right .
yeah .

it's supposed to be lasagne .
it's like big spaghetti wide spaghetti .

that's to wash the floor .
do you think there's any chance that she'll try the car again ?
yeah .
if if not it's no it's no problem but .
okay thanks .
what're you running away for ?
we gotta put the care back together again .
put these back on the shelf .
okay ?
well we have to just make believe .
let's see if we can get the car back together again .
that's gonna be the tricky part isn't it ?
wow !
i don't know ursula .
yeah .
tricky huh ?
that's upside down i think .
isn't it ?
let's see .
like that ?
no .
no .
that's not right either .
you probably can do it better than i can .
this part here on the side ?
lessee .
like that .
and then we have to put the wheels on don't we ?
that's it .
okay gotta put those wheels on now so the whole thing doesn't fall apart .
you may need that .
you may .
mm .
how bout this ?
yeah but don't put the tools away until you finish putting your car together .
you might need it .
you might need your tools .
your tools .
i don't even know how this thing goes .
there we go .
you're better at this than i am .
i'm not too good at putting things together .
okay .
now you can do it with your fingers .
i think .
that's right .
that's right .
there keep tightening it .
that's it .
that's it .
that's just what the men do when they change a tire on a car .
what happened ?
it's not going in right ?
something in there ?
you put it away .
see you might need it .
mhm .
is it getting tight or not ?
okay .
yeah that's right .
some men fix cars for their job you know .
well that's what they do to to earn money to take care of their familys .
that's what some men do .
not your daddy but some daddys do .
this is getting to be .
is it getting tight ?
okay let's try this one .
i think we've got it the wrong way .
that's what the problem is .
got it the wrong way .
no that was right .
mm .
you weren't scared .
what're those other um ?
does it go on the back ?
usually they do .
just a second .
move your fingers a minute .
now here .
get your screw driver .
tighten it up .
that's right !
ih wh you won't be able to do it with your fingers this time .
use that .
go ahead .
it's kinda hard angle for you to reach .
that's it .
right .
pretty good .
okay .
there's a thing that goes in the o .
that's the wheel .
oh .
that's why .
here .
this goes here .
that's why .
i knew it kept spinning and it wasn't doing any good .
there you go .
this goes in here like this .
and that fits in .
and then you turn it .
wait a minute .
there we go .
your mommy's not very mechanical i'm afraid .
i'm not good at this stuff particularly .
it's the windshield huh ?
there .
i don't remember where the which is the front of the care and which is the back of the car .
i'm not sure .
wait a minute now .
okay it goes like this .
see these little spots here ?
it fits in them like that .
that's the windshield .
we have another tire .
there's the tool thing compartment for the tools .
okay .
you see if it does .
you're probably right .
oh an that's better .
now it's balanced .
okay .
what's that go to ?
yeah .
i think so .
mm i'm not sure what might .
uh i think this .
i think that might be .
i think .
just turn it i think .
yeah .
that's right .
boy you're smart .
wow !
how do you know to do that ?
did somebody show you ?
did your daddy show you ?
no ?
you mean you know how to do that all by yourself ?

now i was just thinking about something that ryan probably does not know about and that is the other night you had that very interesting dream .
about land before time do you want to tell ryan what happened in your dream ?
it was a very interesting dream .
he woke up in the morning and he said momma i had this dream .
what was in the dream ?
tell about the dream .
dinosaurs ?
and what was interesting about the dinosaurs though in your dream ?
they go to the great valley but you told me about how you were in the dream .
you were a longneck ?
that is so cool .
and then how about some of your other friends ?
you forget which one is sarah well you told me it was ricky .
you don't remember who's sarah's daddy i think it was casin or jackson i don't remember .
casin .
it was a very interesting dream yeah .
now you know you told ryan about going to get your new little toy at the at the at the you know your new little kazoo did you tell him what else you saw at the museum ?
snow ?
now what was it doing ?
oh okay .
they have play there ?
oh a play there that's right you went and saw a play there .
i don't really know what the play was about though what was the play about ?
oh so the play was about snowflakes .
and then you also made something there too .
what'd you make ?
oh you got to make a snowflake .
how'd you make it ?
what did you use ?
you forget well was it made out of real snow ?
what would happen if it was made out of real snow ?
melt .
you know i don't think we've seen ryan since we've been since you and i and daddy went to the nature class .
remember that day and we made some things for the birds and animals ?
what'd we make there ?
well one thing i'll give you a little hint it's something that was kind of silly because we can eat it too for breakfast .
cereal ?
what'd we do with the cereal ?
we put it on string um hm .
so we put it on the string and then what'd we do with it ?
okay .
what does it say ?
oh can i give you a hint ?
it's june .
june ninth .
can you guess how old he's gonna be ?
how old are you gonna be ?
ten ?
three right now .
so then you're gonna be six right ?
oh just four yep .
you're getting very big huh ?
we did maybe about a month ago or so we were talked about your birthday and we were thinking about whether you would have wanted to have a party where people came over or maybe just take a good friend and go to the zoo .
what do you think you would like to do for your birthday ?
so you were thinking that if a lot of people might think about coming to the party ?
and you think that only one really should come ?
you don't want a lot of people arguing about the toys that people are playing with ?
well if you only got to invite one friend what would you do ?
you're gonna invite marissa well that would be nice .
that would be nice .
is that a plan ?
how are we gonna let marissa know about it ?
oh so you have a lot of good ideas .
so you think that she would be thinking about coming and then you want to get a map so that you can know where her house is and then you're gonna bring her the card ?
sounds like a good plan .
you don't think it will be a day when you go to school ?
it won't be it will be after school ends .
you usually finish school in the middle of may and then comes june so you'll be out a good while before your birthday is .
what is that ?
whoa i should move i don't know if i want to be by that ?
what kind of things can this pinchie do ?
well why don't you tell dr weist what the pinchie can do .

well what'd you think ?
it seems like it could be a what what do these seem to be maybe ?
what are those things it starts with an m ?
we call them ?
metal sticks ?
what attracts metal what are the things that can pick up the metal ?
remember you got a whole box of them what are those called ?
magnets yeah .
so you think that's what's going on there's a magnet here ?
i think what it is is that when you grab it here let's show your nose in here so we can talk about this okay .
all it does is it just mushes the thing like this brings these little arms together and it mushes the things .
that's why you can stick them in .
well you know i was thinking something very interesting happened yesterday morning with our garbage .
do you remember what happened with our garbage ?
it fell over .
how'd it fall over ?
by all the wind but then so our garbage fell over and then what ended up happening to all our garbage ?

oh jason cantridge .
well then you probably know how it works .
let's take it out of the box okay ?
okay do you know how it works ?
well those are tools ?
well let's see if we can figure it out okay ?
yeah they're two bolts .
ho how do you take a bolt out ?
you don't know .
you could use a screw driver ?
that's gonna be hard to get it in there ?
see where the slot is ?
does the screw driver fit in the slot ?
try turning the slot oh yeah ?
that's gonna need some help though .
you know what .
it needs the wrench to hold .
no ?
you just turn this and i will hold the nut .
you turn the bolt .
okay okay is that loose enough to pull out with your fingers .
okay alright ah now we've got the idea .
you want to do the same one on the other side .
okay .
okay here all the pieces that you take out we'll put in a pile .
does that loosen it .
the flashlights ?
the headlights .
the headlights .
this is like being a mechanic ?
i wonder if these same toys will be here when we came back with daddy .
that comes off .
that's the front fender front bumper okay .
oh put it in the same pile .
okay now what else can you unscrew with that screw driver .
that's the front headlights .
yeah .
i don't know but i'm sure that whatever it is it's not tools like this .
probably not yet .
okay now what else comes apart .
now that you have taken that apart .
okay .
those are the hubcaps .
they're screws .
they're supposed to be the hubcaps on the car !
it needs to be screwed more doesn't it !
if you need the extra help .
looks like you're doing okay yourself ?
okay let's see ?
use the screw driver because that's what the screw driver is supposed to do is to help you unscrew ?
let's see now .
there .
you unscrew while i hold the wheel there okay .
hen when it's loose enough you can pull it out with your fingers .
okay very good job .
off comes the wheel .
okay .
that's one .
we've still got how many left to do .
do you know how many are left to do ?
three more .
that's right .
are you making that looser or tighter ?
you want to make it looser if you want to take it apart .
oh no .
it's not locked .
it's just closed so that people walking up and down the hall won't bother us .
that's one more .
okay who's going to take the tire off me or you .
you ?
uh oh now i know why they call it a take apart car .
that's one whole side of the car taken apart .
here we've got one more side of the car to take apart ?
oh look what else just came off .
the hood of the engine came off .
now we can see what's wrong with the engine .
do you want to see what's wrong with the engine ?
or you wanna keep taking apart the wheel .
okay okay this is like a puzzle isn't it .
what are you gonna do after we take it all apart ?
put it back together .
that's gonna be a trick .
okay what do you think is going to come off now !
hat wooden side huh ?
okay it's almost all apart .
it's almost all apart .
that's the engine .
okay .
aha .
can we be the mechanics ?
absolutely !
hm .
something in the trunk too .
oh look what the trunk has in it .
a spare tire .
that's like in our car we have a spare tire in case we get a flat tire .
so that has to be taken apart too ?
mhm ?
you know how many there are ?
or do you have to count them .
mhm .
okay alright let's see .
there's some more bolts left in here .
two more bolts .
do you remember that the yellow bolts go on the sides ?
can you remember that ?
cause when we put it back together we are going to have to remember which bolts go where .
oh the dash board just came down ?
okay .
this is the dash board .
it fits in here alright .
okay .
no it doesn't have to be screwed it needs to be slided .
just slide it .
alright it looks to me like you can do almost everything with just the screw driver .
one more thing has to come apart .
beep beep .
what has to come apart ?
the horn is another screw .
can you find the screw driver in this ?
whole pile here ?
the whole thing came ?
that's why they call this a take apart car .
and you just took it apart ?
without any help ?
cause you didn't need any help .
now what .
okay .
what should we do first ?
well you know that thing on sesame street where the little boy gets lost and he is told to remember whatever he did last he should do first ?
and then he'd find his way back home again .
well i think what we should do is try to remember what we took apart last and put that together first .
what's the last thing we took apart ?
hm ?
the very last thing you did was the steering wheel ?
let's do that first ?
oh you want to pretend that you're a mechanic ?
you know how she cleaned the toe shoes ?
she said oh just a little bit of this and a little bit of that .
in other words find out for yourself you know ?
oh some of them are a they're all you know like .
trade secrets .
yeah you know ?
foolish stuff .
somebody had to tell her i suppose .
just a little bit of this and a little bit of that .
she wants sarah to dance with her son next year .
a little bit of this and a little bit of that .
she'll get too .
what are you doing sarah ?
bless you .
sarah marie !
want a cup of tea ?
no thanks .
are you sure ?
very sure .
i don't blame you with all this mess .
oh .
are they clean now ?
the scissors .
why do they have to be clean ?
when it dries out though you won't be able to notice the spots on it huh ?
that's true .
maybe .
what ?
glue ?
by the time you walk up three flights of stairs it'll probably be just as bad anyway .
father's day ?
where did you go yesterday ?
what ?

very good ross .
right okay that was very interesting .
so i can have the light from the back ?
why ?
although it is true it's nice to have this light come from behind .
it is not is isn't .
you don't like my explanation ?
easier on my eyes right .
but was my explanation really a bad explanation .
no but not whether my idea was a bad idea .
but when i told you the reason i put it up there was to get light from behind ?
did you think that was really wrong ?
what was the real reason that i did it ?
okay thank you ?
where do you have to put your legs up ?
yeah .
i'm not telling .
no maybe they're for me and i'm not telling .
well maybe they're for grandpa and grandma ?
i'm not sure .
i want to go outside and see the witches .
what ?
what's so fare about that ?
yes ?
and what's fare for you ?
so that the part that's fare for me is that i don't have to do too much .
and what's the part that's fare for you ?
oh you get to do some .
aha ?
i'm falling .
is that a good deal for both of us do you think .
okay but i thought you were going to talk about another problem you and i have ?
you forgot about the other problem ?
what is it ?
what is that other problem ?
it had to do with the telephone .
yeah there was a problem with the telephone ?
upstairs in my room ?
no ?
there was a little problem we had ?
what was it ?
and you hit marky and so what's the problem .
and what other problem was there ?
what ?
no what was bad about it ?
yeah and what else ?
and what else .
and you still haven't apologized to your grandfather ?
so there are three bad things .
first that you hit marky .
okay four count them .
to marky you didn't apologize to marky .
okay and then third .
yeah .
and four ?
no that wasn't that's not something wrong ?
going to your room is a punishment it's not something you did wrong ?
okay you want me to tell you what the fourth is .
you didn't apologize to grandpa for not talking to him .
you still haven't done that you could do that still .
no he didn't do that ?
and there's one more of the thing that you did that was wrong .
is that you made it so your father couldn't talk to grandpa .
five things ?
okay now which of those can we fix .
of those five there is one that we can still fix .
daddy ?
okay .
two of them you fix one of them right now ?
yeah ?
okay what about the other one .
how do you fix that one ?
when are you going to do ?
which one .
what do you mean maybe today but really tomorrow ?
ow my foot is falling ?
you promise you will do it tomorrow ?
promise ?
okay and what other promise did you make for me tonight ?
no no you made another promise to me earlier tonight what was it ?
it had to do with the lego blocks ?
what was the promise ?
no it had nothing to do with that .
you made me a promise remember the little lego blocks ?
you made a promise to your father ?
okay did you do it ?
aha and are they all fixed and put back ?
do you know what happened ?
marky took them together apart again ?
okay ?
no no your promise is that you're going to get those blocks back ?
that's your promise .
you understand what a promise is .
well that's another problem ?
now remember what happens if you don't fulfill your promise ?
what's supposed to happen ?
okay so is that ready are we ready for that ?
jump over ?
okay then after do you promise to put the blocks back together ?
yeah promise promise .
do you promise too ?
okay ?
sure honey ?
something happened to santa claus ?
yeah i guess he needs to be blown up again ?
what hole ?
no i didn't find a hole up there ?
okay honey there wasn't a hole on the very top .
well just wait a second ross you just tell me here's the hole .
it's not a hole .
that's just maybe it's broken ?
maybe that's where it's broken .
it's not broken .
not not broken ross you're just wrong it's that simple !
i want to play santa claus .
you mean that hole right there .
there's no hole .
there's just no hole there honey .
okay let ross touch the hole mom .
here's the hole ?
let him touch it ?
i found the hole .
i found the hole guys .
okay we we're pretty sure that santa claus is broken now .
we're pretty sure santa claus is broken because somebody jum hit him too hard .
no that's where dad took ross out of the bath tub and put him on the bed when he was all wet .
why what do you mean even when they're dry .
oh that's true ?
do you want more milk ?
honey you don't say ?
just my second one .
it was my second one .
and i don't want anymore .
you say ?
it was just my first and i want one more but it was my second and i'm finished .
is that right .
girl isn't a baby either ?
didn't you forget something .
this morrow i don't want to take my shoes ?
why .
these are for boys ?
of course that's not a good reason ?
right ?
that's how he put it !
aha !
it was a huge balloon uh .
it wasn't a little heman .
oh that's great ross that's great .
marky did you see that ?
at ?
they did ?
at children's palace uh !
when did you guys go to children's palace ?
oh you went you saw them on tv .
oh the add ?
do you want toys ross ?
right those toys you want are for christmas so why should we go to children's palace ?
we already ?
oh well we'll go after this christmas is finished okay .
i want a real real bad monster who steps on heman .
your amigo .
oh they don't have amigos any more ?
amigos they're not going to get for a awhile only if we're lucky ?
they stopped carrying amigos .
isn't that horrible .
just like they stopped showing the phoenix dirty trick right .
is that fare ross .
do you want some of the potatos ?
right .
why can't i .
you teasted me you tricked me into that ?
right ?
do you still play with brian ?
sometimes .
how come you learned learned it from him ?
he does .
do you ever play with him at all ?
who do you play with now ?
yeah who do you play with now ?
and ?
and .
austin and maria lane no ?
and who else .
jeannie .
jeannie .
okay .
that means you didn't go outside ?
it means don't go .
we cuffed outside so we not outside right .
we no .
we didn't go outside so cuffed means didn't go .
how about we cuffed go outside ?
what do you say ?
uncuffed go .
aha uncuffed means yes .
oh uncuffed means yes .
well that's nice ?
and the word what is the word .
that means that .
uncuffed right .
and what if i say to you do you want some chocolate what do you say ?
that means no ?
and what if i say do you want ah some toys for christmas ?
what do you say ?
uncuffed good very good ?
tell the whole story now ?
aha ?
aha .
well where where are the meat .
where is the meat ?
in his tummy .
yeah but in meat eaters where's the meat ?
so on the meat eaters the meat is all over and on the planter eaters don't have any meat ?
ross that can't be right ?
that doesn't make sense .
all animals have meat are full with meat .
meat eater means they eat meat .
dad ?
yes marky just a minute .
what is that ?
bologna and um mayonnaise mayonnaise not butter it's not marky .
oh .
it's not butter !
is that butter ?
no ?
they're recording .
that's okay ?
um ross it doesn't make any sense ?
to say that that the plant eaters don't have any meat ?
is this butter ?
because their bodies are made of meat .
your body is made of meat ?
only if you eat meat .
you have meat in it ?
yeah you have meat in your body .
yeah but there is no meat in your tummy unless you eat meat .
you see you gotta understand something okay ?
your tummy if you eat plants your tummy takes the plants and puts them into the tummy and makes them into meat and puts the meat all over your body .
muscles ?
muscles muscles are meat .
you take plants okay you you see that apple sauce .
that's not meat is it ?
now if you eat that apple sauce what's going to happen .
no it'll go no your going to make apple sauce arms .
no .
which is right unless you want seconds or thirds or in case you want seconds or thirds .
which one did you say .
what's the difference ?
hum .
it make more sense ?
good ross .
do you want some milk ?
oh i'm sorry honey ross spilt some water ?
what happened ross ?
tell the whole story ?
well what's you say .
yeah go ahead it's okay .
tell the whole story .
and it feels like i was shocked ?
shocked .
i feel something in my neck and it feels like i was shocked ?
it felt like i was shocked ?
aha .

sure they can ?
but how do you get a headache that shocks ?
you must be sick .
how about mom ?

some little shoes didn't he have some shoes .
what do they have up here ?
yeh that's right whiskers .
a frog doesn't have whiskers .
and what else does a rabbit have that you don't think anything else has ?
what back here ?
uh huh a little tail .
no frog doesn't have a tail that sticks out .
see a little bunny rabbit has like a little fluffy tail .
yes a tiger has a tail .
but is a tiger tail and a bunny tail exactly alike ?
well then tell me what's different about it .
how does a tiger's tail look ?
okay .
well you just show me what the tiger tail looks like .
alright well .
well what do you mean it looks like this ?
is it long or is it short ?
is the tiger tail long or short ?
okay is the bunny tail is what ?
oh yes .
much longer .
that's right .
it sticks out way in the back it's much longer .
does it go back and forth like this maybe ?
and does the bunny the bunny tail go back and forth like that ?
no the bunny tail just stays like that probably doesn't it ?
well then what about the color ?
well tell me about the tiger .
the tiger is white ?
okay well what's white ?
well maybe if it were a little brown bunny rabbit it might not be .
mightn't it ?
the tiger ?
or the bunny rabbit .
well is it does a tiger have spots .
or stripes ?
okay .
a tiger has spots ?
i thought a leopard had spots .
stripes ?
the leopard has stripes ?
i thought the leopard had spots .
oh well it's stripes not striped .
stripe stripes .
good that was good .
okay well tell me what else about the bunny .
okay .
well you know what ?
i don't know .
do you think a cat would have a twitching nose too ?
well i don't know .
i can't remember .
i don't know .
i think maybe a cat might twitch its nose too but i'm not sure .
i really can't remember .
but what else would be different ?
who can make nosie ?
yes well we're talking about two particular animals though .
which animal can make .
okay the lion .
or the tiger .
can make noise .
but what about the rabbit ?
no the rabbit is silent .
well what kind of rabbit noise ?
no i don't think the rabbit makes any noise .
i think no i think the rabbit is quiet .
how does the rabbit communicate ?
what does he do ?
well i don't know that that's communication .
does the rabbit stamp on the ground ?
yeh i think so .
i think that's all the rabbit can do maybe .
is stamp their feet on the ground .
but he can twitch his nose .

i don't know .

that would be funny wouldn't it ?
those are just different kinds of bicycles and then see they've got these little shields and so that helps make them to be able to go faster .
and this has three wheels and the guy leans back and it's very little air resistance so it can go real fast .
it can go faster than most bicycle can go .
but it's hard .
you have to lie down and pedal .
that would be really hard i think .
and there's another one .
see it's got that little shield and you're inside some plastic and that makes it easier to go a lot faster .
that's a funny bike that's got a small wheel and a big wheel .
it's not a wheelchair but he sure does look strange on it doesn't it ?
and he has uh that's just a funny looking bicycle .
that's the same bicycle looked at from a different angle .
and here's a very very small one .
small front wheel .
is this a small back wheel ?
or a big one .
it's a very big one .
and what is this ?

can you put the spare tire on ?
well why don't you do one at a time okay ?

because other children are gonna are gonna wh play with these things .
okay here .
alright .
let me show you turn it .
see the way i'm holding it ?
see and just turn it in your fingers that's right good that's very good .
um you can try .

okay turn it some more .
good .
keep turning .
keep turning until the screw comes out .
oh i think it works .
that's a hard one isn't it ?
try it .
turn it some more .

it's looks very loose .
oh then it came out .
look at this .

you put it back .
yes you can .
it fits like this one fits .

oh okay .
okay is there something wrong with the engine ?
oh .
what's the matter with it ?
oh .
okay why don't .
here .
that's right .
okay i think if you use both hands it'll be easier use one hand to hold .
okay that's right .
go ahead .
oh you know you may have to use one hand to hold the wheel and one hand to work the screw driver okay .
helen ?
do you think you'd like me to read the story to you ?
would you like to stop and read the story ?
no ?
you like this ?
you sure ?

would you like to play store ?
or something like that ?
we can .
okay do you wanna do you wanna put the car back together and play store ?
okay .
okay put it put it in here .
wait a minute .
there .
okay now i think you can screw that back in .
turn it the other way .
turn it .
that's right .
yeah .
you turn it in one direction when you want to take the screw out .
and you turn it in the other direction when you want to put it in .
that would take it out helen .
turn it the other way to put it in .
okay that's good .
that's very good .
you're doing a good job .
well you have to learn how to turn it between your fingers .
that's good .
that's very good .
that's very good .
i know .
just relax .
see ?
see and in fact if you use two hands it might be a little bit easier for you .
should .
let's try to put another wheel in .
okay ?
alright .
okay alright .
i'll hold the car for you and you get a screw that's right .
put it in and in fact you know what might be a little bit easier to begin with ?
turn it with your hand first .
that's right .
and then when you have to tighten it you can use a screw driver .
alright .
you can .
now put the screw driver in .
okay that's right .
and tighten it .
tighten it .
good .
that's good .
that one ?
whoops ?
something fell out here .

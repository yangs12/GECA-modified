aberdeen aberdeen ( ; , ; ; ) is a city in northeast scotland .
it is scotland's third most populous city , one of scotland's *num* local government council areas and the united kingdom's *ord* most populous built-up area , with an official population estimate of *num* , *num* for the city of aberdeen and for the local council area .
during the *ord* to *ord* centuries , aberdeen's buildings incorporated locally quarried grey granite , which can sparkle like silver because of its high mica content .
since the discovery of north sea oil in the 1970s , aberdeen has been known as the off-shore oil capital of europe .
the area around aberdeen has been settled since at least *num* , *num* years ago , when prehistoric villages lay around the mouths of the rivers dee and don .
the city has a long , sandy coastline and a marine climate , the latter resulting in chilly summers and mild winters .
aberdeen received royal burgh status from david i of scotland ( 1124–1153 ) , transforming the city economically .
the city's two universities , the university of aberdeen , founded in *num* , and robert gordon university , which was awarded university status in *num* , make aberdeen the educational centre of the north-east of scotland .
the traditional industries of fishing , paper-making , shipbuilding , and textiles have been overtaken by the oil industry and aberdeen's seaport .
aberdeen heliport is one of the busiest commercial heliports in the world and the seaport is the largest in the north-east of scotland .
aberdeen hosts the aberdeen international youth festival , a major international event which attracts up to *num* of the most talented young performing arts companies .
in *num* , mercer named aberdeen the *ord* most liveable city in the world , as well as the fourth most liveable city in britain .

in *num* , aberdeen was found to be the best city in the uk to start a business in a study released by card payment firm paymentsense .
the aberdeen area has seen human settlement for at least *num* , *num* years .
the city began as two separate burghs : old aberdeen at the mouth of the river don ; and new aberdeen , a fishing and trading settlement , where the denburn waterway entered the river dee estuary .
the earliest charter was granted by william the lion in *num* and confirmed the corporate rights granted by david i .
in *num* , the great charter of robert the bruce transformed aberdeen into a property-owning and financially independent community .
granted with it was the nearby forest of stocket , whose income formed the basis for the city's common good fund which still benefits aberdonians .
during the wars of scottish independence , aberdeen was under english rule , so robert the bruce laid siege to aberdeen castle before destroying it in *num* , followed by the massacring of the english garrison .
the city was burned by edward iii of england in *num* , but was rebuilt and extended .
the city was strongly fortified to prevent attacks by neighbouring lords , but the gates were removed by *num* .
during the wars of the three kingdoms of *num* to *num* the city was plundered by both sides .
in *num* , it was taken and ransacked by royalist troops after the battle of aberdeen and two years later it was stormed by a royalist force under the command of the marquis of huntly .
in *num* an outbreak of bubonic plague killed a quarter of the population .
in the *ord* century , a new town hall was built and the first social services appeared with the infirmary at woolmanhill in *num* and the lunatic asylum in *num* .
the council began major road improvements at the end of the *ord* century with the main thoroughfares of george street , king street and union street all completed at the beginning of the *ord* century .
the expensive infrastructure works led to the city becoming bankrupt in *num* during the post-napoleonic depression , an economic downturn immediately after the napoleonic wars ; but the city's prosperity later recovered .
the increasing economic importance of aberdeen and the development of the shipbuilding and fishing industries led to the construction of the present harbour including victoria dock and the south breakwater , and the extension of the north pier .
gas street lighting arrived in *num* and an enhanced water supply appeared in *num* when water was pumped from the dee to a reservoir in union place .
an underground sewer system replaced open sewers in *num* .
the city was incorporated in *num* .
although old aberdeen has a separate history and still holds its ancient charter , it is no longer officially independent .
it is an integral part of the city , as is woodside and the royal burgh of torry to the south of the river dee .
during the second world war aberdeen was bombed quite badly especially on the *num* april *num* when around *num* luftwaffe bombers circled around aberdeen .
because there were no planes at raf leuchars they were all fighting in the battle of britain this meant that the bombers would simply fly back and forth around aberdeen .
*num* people died on that night and approximately *num* , *num* homes were destroyed during the bombing which caused severe damage to many different homes around the city .
aberdeen was in pictish territory and became gaelic-speaking at some time in the medieval period .
old aberdeen is the approximate location of " aberdon " , the first settlement of aberdeen ; this literally means " the mouth of the don " .
the celtic word ' means " river mouth " , as in modern welsh ( aberystwyth , aberdare , aberbeeg etc ) .
the scottish gaelic name is ' ( variation : ' ; * ' presumably being a loan from the earlier pictish ; the gaelic term is ) , and in latin , the romans referred to the river as " devana " .
mediaeval ( or ecclesiastical ) latin has it as " " .
aberdeen is locally governed by aberdeen city council , which comprises forty-five councillors who represent the city's wards and is headed by the lord provost .
the current lord provost is barney crockett .
from may *num* until may *num* the council was run by a liberal democrat and conservative party coalition .
following the may *num* local elections , the liberal democrats formed a new coalition with the scottish national party .
after a later snp by-election gain from the conservatives , this coalition held *num* of the *num* seats .
following the election of *num* may *num* , the council was controlled by a coalition of scottish labour , scottish conservatives and independent councillors ; the labour councillors were subsequently suspended by scottish labour party leader , kezia dugdale .
aberdeen is represented in the parliament of the united kingdom by three constituencies : aberdeen north and aberdeen south which are wholly within the aberdeen city council area , and gordon , which includes a large area of the aberdeenshire council area .
in the scottish parliament , the city is represented by three constituencies with different boundaries : aberdeen central and aberdeen donside are wholly within the aberdeen city council area .
aberdeen south and north kincardine includes the north kincardine ward of aberdeenshire council .
a further seven msps are elected as part of the north east scotland electoral region .
in the european parliament the city is represented by six meps as part of the all-inclusive scotland constituency .
the arms and banner of the city show three silver towers on red .
this motif dates from at least the time of robert the bruce and represents the buildings that stood on the three hills of medieval aberdeen : aberdeen castle on castle hill ( today's castlegate ) ; the city gate on port hill ; and a church on st catherine's hill ( now levelled ) .
"bon accord " is the motto of the city and is french for " good agreement " .
legend tells that its use dates from a password used by robert the bruce during the *ord* century wars of scottish independence , when he and his men laid siege to the english-held aberdeen castle before destroying it in *num* .
it is still widely present in the city , throughout street names , business names and the city's bon accord shopping mall .
the shield in the coat of arms is supported by two leopards .
a local magazine is called the " leopard " and , when union bridge was widened in the *ord* century , small statues of the creature in a sitting position were cast and placed on top of the railing posts ( known locally as kelly's cats ) .
the city's toast is " happy to meet , sorry to part , happy to meet again " ; this has been commonly misinterpreted as the translation of bon accord .
being sited between two river mouths , the city has little natural exposure of bedrock .
this leaves local geologists in a slight quandary : despite the high concentration of geoscientists in the area ( courtesy of the oil industry ) , there is only a vague understanding of what underlies the city .
to the south side of the city , coastal cliffs expose high-grade metamorphic rocks of the grampian group ; to the south-west and west are extensive granites intruded into similar high-grade schists ; to the north the metamorphics are intruded by gabbroic complexes instead .
the small amount of geophysics done , and occasional building-related exposures , combined with small exposures in the banks of the river don , suggest that it is actually sited on an inlier of devonian " old red " sandstones and silts .
the outskirts of the city spread beyond the ( inferred ) limits of the outlier onto the surrounding metamorphic / igneous complexes formed during the dalradian period ( approximately 480–600 million years ago ) with sporadic areas of igneous diorite granites to be found , such as that at the rubislaw quarry which was used to build much of the victorian parts of the city .
on the coast , aberdeen has a long sand beach between the two rivers , the dee and the don , which turns into high sand dunes north of the don stretching as far as fraserburgh ; to the south of the dee are steep rocky cliff faces with only minor pebble and shingle beaches in deep inlets .
a number of granite outcrops along the south coast have been quarried in the past , making for spectacular scenery and good rock-climbing .
the city extends to , and includes the former burghs of old aberdeen , new aberdeen , woodside and the royal burgh of torry to the south of river dee .
in this gave the city a population density of .
the city is built on many hills , with the original beginnings of the city growing from castle hill , st .
catherine's hill and windmill hill .
aberdeen features an oceanic climate ( köppen " cfb " ) .
aberdeen has far milder winter temperatures than one might expect for its northern location , although statistically it is the coldest city in the uk .
during the winter , especially throughout december , the length of the day is very short , averaging *num* hours and *num* minutes between sunrise and sunset at winter solstice .
as winter progresses , the length of the day grows fairly quickly , to *num* hours and *num* minutes by the end of january .
around summer solstice , the days will be around *num* hours long , having *num* hours and *num* minutes between sunrise and sunset .
during this time of the year marginal nautical twilight lasts the entire night .
temperatures at this time of year will be typically hovering around during the day in most of the urban area , though nearer directly on the coast , and around in the westernmost suburbs , illustrating the cooling effect of the north sea during summer .
in addition , from june onward skies are more overcast than in april / may , as reflected in a lower percentage of possible sunshine ( the percentage of daylight hours that are sunny ) .
these factors render summer to be temperate and cool for the latitude , both by european standards and also compared to far inland climates on other continents , with those patterns being reversed during the mild and moderated winters .
two weather stations collect climate data for the area , aberdeen / dyce airport , and craibstone .
both are about to the north west of the city centre , and given that they are in close proximity to each other , exhibit very similar climatic regimes .
dyce tends to have marginally warmer daytime temperatures year round owing to its slightly lower elevation , though it is more susceptible to harsh frosts .
the coldest temperature to occur in recent years was during december *num* , while the following winter , dyce set a new february high temperature station record on *num* february *num* of .
, and a new march high temperature record of on *num* march *num* .

in the middle ages , the kirk of st nicholas was the only burgh kirk and one of scotland's largest parish churches .
like a number of other scottish kirks , it was subdivided after the reformation , in this case into the east and west churches .
at this time , the city also was home to houses of the carmelites ( whitefriars ) and franciscans ( greyfriars ) , the latter of which surviving in modified form as the chapel of marischal college as late as the early *ord* century .
st machar's cathedral was built twenty years after david i ( 1124–1153 ) transferred the pre-reformation diocese from mortlach in banffshire to old aberdeen in *num* .
with the exception of the episcopate of william elphinstone ( 1484–1511 ) , building progressed slowly .
gavin dunbar , who followed him in *num* , completed the structure by adding the two western spires and the southern transept .
it is now a congregation of the church of scotland .
aberdeen has two other cathedrals : st .
mary's cathedral is a roman catholic cathedral in gothic style , erected in *num* .

there is also a mosque in old aberdeen which serves the islamic community in the city , and an orthodox jewish synagogue established in *num* .
there is also a thai buddhist temple located in the hazelhead area of the city .
there are no formal hindu buildings , although the university of aberdeen has a small bahá'í society and there is a fortnightly hindu religious gathering in the *ord* and *ord* sunday afternoons at queens cross parish church hall .
traditionally , aberdeen was home to fishing , textile mills , shipbuilding and paper making .
these industries have been largely replaced .
high technology developments in the electronics design and development industry , research in agriculture and fishing and the oil industry , which has been largely responsible for aberdeen's economic boom in the last three decades , are now major parts of aberdeen's economy .
until the 1970s , most of aberdeen's leading industries dated from the *ord* century ; mainly these were textiles , foundry work , shipbuilding and paper-making , the oldest industry in the city , with paper having been first made there in *num* .
paper-making has reduced in importance since the closures of donside paper mill in *num* and the davidson mill in *num* leaving the stoneywood paper mill with a workforce of approximately *num* .
textile production ended in *num* when richards of aberdeen closed .
grey granite was quarried at rubislaw quarry for more than *num* years , and used for paving setts , kerb and building stones , and monumental and other ornamental pieces .
aberdeen granite was used to build the terraces of the houses of parliament and waterloo bridge in london .
quarrying finally ceased in *num* .
the current owners have begun pumping *num* years of rain water from the quarry with the aim of developing a heritage centre on the site .
fishing was once the predominant industry , but was surpassed by deep-sea fisheries , which derived a great impetus from improved technologies throughout the *ord* century .
catches have fallen because of overfishing and the use of the harbour by oil support vessels , and so although still an important fishing port it is now eclipsed by the more northerly ports of peterhead and fraserburgh .
the fisheries research services are headquartered in aberdeen , and there is a marine research lab in torry .
aberdeen is well regarded for the agricultural and soil research carried out at the james hutton institute ( formerly the macaulay land use research institute ) , which has close links to the city's two universities .
the rowett research institute is a world-renowned research centre for studies into food and nutrition located in aberdeen .
it has produced three nobel laureates and there is a high concentration of life scientists working in the city .
as oil reserves in the north sea decrease there is an effort to rebrand aberdeen as " energy capital of europe " rather than " oil capital of europe " , and there is interest in the development of new energy sources ; and technology transfer from oil into renewable energy and other industries is under way .
the " energetica " initiative led by scottish enterprise has been designed to accelerate this process .
as of *num* , aberdeen remained a major world centre for undersea petroleum technology .
aberdeen had been a major maritime centre throughout the *ord* century , when a group of local entrepreneurs launched the first steam-powered trawler .
the steam trawling industry expanded and by *num* aberdeen was scotland's top fishing port , employing nearly *num* , *num* men with *num* vessels sailing from its harbour .
by the time oil was coming on stream , much of the trawling fleet had relocated to peterhead .
although aberdeen still brings in substantial catches , the tugs , safety vessels and supply ships which pack the harbour far outnumber the trawlers .
geologists had speculated about the existence of oil and gas in the north sea since the middle of the *ord* century , but tapping its deep and inhospitable waters was another story .
with the middle eastern oil sheiks becoming more aware of the political and economic power of their oil reserves and government threats of rationing , the industry began to consider the north sea as a viable source of oil .
exploration commenced in the 1960s and the first major find in the british sector was in november *num* in the forties field , east of aberdeen .
by late *num* , after years of intense construction the necessary infrastructure was in place .
in aberdeen , at bp's ( british petroleum ) headquarters , the queen pressed the button that would set the whole thing moving .
oil flowed from the rig directly to the refinery at far-away grangemouth .
while many ports have suffered decline , aberdeen remains busy because of the oil trade and the influx of people connected with the industry , a subsequent rise in property prices have brought prosperity to the area .
the industry supports about *num* , *num* jobs locally , and known reserves ensure that oil will continue to flow well into the *ord* century .
as a major port in the uk , aberdeen receives many ships calling at the port .
seafarers ' welfare organisation , apostleship of the sea has a port chaplain in aberdeen to offer practical and pastoral support to them .
in *num* , the centre for cities named aberdeen as the best placed city for growth in britain , as the country looked to emerge from the recent economic downturn .
with energy still providing the backbone of the local economy , recent years have seen very large new investment in the north sea owing to rising oil prices and favourable government tax incentives .
this has led to several oil majors and independents building new global offices in the city .
aberdeen city and shire's gross domestic product is estimated at over £11 .
*num* billion , accounting for over *num* % of the overall scottish gdp .
five of scotland's top ten businesses are based in aberdeen with a collective turnover of £14 billion , yielding a profit in excess of £2 .
*num* billion .
alongside this *num* of scotland's top *num* businesses are located in aberdeen with an employment rate of *num* .
*num* % , making it the *ord* highest uk city for employment .
figures released in *num* ranked aberdeen as having the second highest amount of patents processed per person in the uk .
the traditional shopping streets are union street and george street , now complemented by shopping centres , notably the bon accord & st nicholas and the trinity shopping centre .
a £190 million retail development , union square , reached completion in late september / early october *num* .
major retail parks away from the city centre include the berryden retail park , the kittybrewster retail park and the beach boulevard retail park .
in march *num* , aberdeen was awarded fairtrade city status by the fairtrade foundation .
along with dundee , it shares the distinction of being the first city in scotland to receive this accolade .
aberdeen's architecture is known for its principal use during the victorian era of granite , which has led to its local nickname of the " granite city " or more romantically the less commonly used name the " silver city " , since the mica in the stone sparkles in the sun .
the hard grey stone is one of the most durable materials available and helps to explain why the city's buildings look brand-new when they have been newly cleaned and the cement has been pointed .
unlike other scottish cities where sandstone has been used , the buildings are not weathering and need very little structural maintenance on their masonry .
the buildings can however become noticeably darker as a result of pollution and grime accumulated over the years .
there has however been great success in cleaning the buildings which can result in their façade being restored back to much how they looked originally .
amongst the notable buildings in the city's main street , union street , are the town and county bank , the music hall , the trinity hall of the incorporated trades ( originating between *num* and *num* , although completely rebuilt in the 1860s ) , now a shopping mall ; the former office of the northern assurance company , and the national bank of scotland .
in castle street , a continuation eastwards of union street , is the new town house , a very prominent landmark in aberdeen , built between *num* and *num* to a design by peddie and kinnear .
alexander marshall mackenzie's extension to marischal college on broad street , opened by king edward vii in *num* , created the second largest granite building in the world ( after the escorial , madrid ) .
in addition to the many fine landmark buildings , aberdeen has many prominent public statues , three of the most notable being william wallace at the junction between union terrace and rosemount viaduct , robert burns on union terrace above union terrace gardens , and robert the bruce holding aloft the charter he issued to the city in *num* on broad street , outside marischal college .
aberdeen has long been famous for its *num* parks and gardens , and citywide floral displays which include two million roses , eleven million daffodils and three million crocuses .
the city has won the royal horticultural society's britain in bloom ' best city ' award ten times , the overall scotland in bloom competition twenty times and the large city category every year since *num* .
however , despite recent spurious reports , aberdeen has never been banned from the britain in bloom competition .
the city won the *num* scotland in bloom " best city " award along with the international cities in bloom award .
the suburb of dyce also won the small towns award .
duthie park opened in *num* on the north bank of the river dee .
it was named after and given to the city by miss elizabeth crombie duthie of ruthrieston in *num* .
it has extensive gardens , a rose hill , boating pond , bandstand , and play area as well as europe's second largest enclosed gardens the david welch winter gardens .
hazlehead park , is large and forested , located on the outskirts of the city , it is popular with walkers in the forests , sports enthusiasts , naturalists and picnickers .
there are football pitches , two golf courses , a pitch and putt course and a horse riding school .
aberdeen's success in the britain in bloom competitions is often attributed to johnston gardens , a small park of one hectare in the west end of the city containing many different flowers and plants which have been renowned for their beauty .
in *num* , the garden was named the best garden in the british islands .
seaton park , formerly the grounds of a private house , is on the edge of the grounds of st machar's cathedral .
the cathedral walk is maintained in a formal style with a great variety of plants providing a popular display .
the park includes several other areas with contrasting styles to this .
union terrace gardens opened in *num* and is situated in the centre of the city .
it covers in the centre of aberdeen bordered on three sides by union street , union terrace and rosemount viaduct .
the park forms a natural amphitheatre located in the denburn valley and is an oasis of peace and calm in the city centre .
a recent proposal to build a three-storey concrete and steel superstructure in place of the gardens , part of which will provide a commercial concourse , has proved highly controversial .
situated next to each other , victoria park and westburn park cover between them .

emperor senka , also known as senkwa , was the *ord* emperor of japan , according to the traditional order of succession .
no firm dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign , but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 536–539 .
keitai is considered to have ruled the country during the *ord* century , but there is a paucity of information about him .
there is insufficient material available for further verification and study .
when emperor ankan died , he had no offspring ; and succession passed to his youngest brother who will come to be known as emperor senka .
emperor senka was elderly at the time of his enthronement ; and his reign is said to have endured for only three years .
senka's contemporary title would not have been " tennō " , as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of emperor tenmu and empress jitō .
rather , it was presumably " sumeramikoto " or " amenoshita shiroshimesu ōkimi " ( 治天下大王 ) , meaning " the great king who rules all under heaven " .
alternatively , senka might have been referred to as ( ヤマト大王 / 大君 ) or the " great king of yamato " .

this emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial shinto shrine ( " misasagi " ) at nara .
the imperial household agency designates this location as senka's mausoleum .
it is formally named " musa no tsukisaka no e no misasagi " ; however , the actual sites of the graves of the early emperors remain problematic , according to some historians and archaeologists .
emperor senka's father was emperor keitai and his mother was menokohime , daughter of owari no muraji kusaka .
in his lifetime , he was known by the name take ohirokuni oshi tate no sumeramikoto ( 武小広国押盾天皇 ) .
his name was hinokuma no takata-ōji ( 檜隈高田皇子 ) .
european route e4 european route e *num* passes from north to south through sweden from the border with finland , with a total length of .
the finnish part lies entirely within tornio in northern finland , and is only long .
the swedish part traverses most of sweden except the extreme north and the west coast region , and is commonly considered the highway backbone of sweden , since it passes in the vicinity of many of its largest cities and through the capital stockholm .
in particular , it is the mainline road used by most vehicle traffic , both personal cars and freight trailers , between the north ( norrland ) and southern sweden or beyond .
from haparanda on the finnish border , it stretches south along the gulf of bothnia to gävle , then on a more inland route southwards .
it ends in helsingborg in sweden , at the port for the ferry to helsingør in denmark .
the route intersects with european route e6 just outside helsingborg , which continues to trelleborg on the southern coast of sweden .
under the new system of european routes it was planned to have been a part of e *num* , but it remains in the pre-1992 designation ( e *num* ) within sweden , because the expenses connected with re-signing this long road portion would be too large .
besides the signs along the road , there are thousands of signs , especially in cities , showing how to reach the e *num* road .
the road is now fully authorized as e *num* by the relevant authority , not as e *num* .
north of gävle the road is of mixed standard .
depending on the fashion at the time of construction it is either a single standard carriageway road , usually wide , or a 2+1 road , a wide road with two lanes in one direction and one in the other with a steel wire barrier in between , or sometimes a motorway with two lanes in each direction .
north of sundsvall , the road passes through several of the larger cities as city streets .
south of gävle , the road becomes an almost continuous motorway , with the only non-motorway part being a long section past ljungby , currently a 2+1 limited-access road .
upgrade to motorway standard will start in *num* .
with the exception of the ljungby bypass , the final stretch of the motorway to be opened was the road between uppsala and mehedeby , which was inaugurated on october *num* , *num* .

archbishop of canterbury the archbishop of canterbury is the senior bishop and principal leader of the church of england , the symbolic head of the worldwide anglican communion and the diocesan bishop of the diocese of canterbury .
the current archbishop is justin welby , who was enthroned at canterbury cathedral on *num* march *num* .
welby is the *ord* in a line which goes back more than *num* years to augustine of canterbury , the " apostle to the english " , sent from rome in the year *num* .
welby succeeded rowan williams .
from the time of augustine until the *ord* century , the archbishops of canterbury were in full communion with the see of rome and usually received the pallium from the pope .
during the english reformation , the church of england broke away from the authority of the catholic church .
thomas cranmer became the first protestant holder of the office in *num* , while reginald pole was the last catholic in the position , serving from *num* to *num* during the counter-reformation .
in the middle ages there was considerable variation in the methods of nomination of the archbishop of canterbury and other bishops .
at various times the choice was made by the canons of canterbury cathedral , the pope , or the king of england .
since the english reformation , the church of england has been more explicitly a state church and the choice is legally that of the crown ; today it is made by the queen on the advice of the prime minister , who in turn receives a shortlist of two names from an " ad hoc " committee called the crown nominations commission .
today the archbishop fills four main roles : in the last two of these functions , he has an important ecumenical and interfaith role , speaking on behalf of anglicans in england and worldwide .
the archbishop's main residence is lambeth palace in the london borough of lambeth .
he also has lodgings in the old palace , canterbury , located beside canterbury cathedral , where the chair of st augustine sits .
as holder of one of the " five great sees " ( the others being york , london , durham and winchester ) , the archbishop of canterbury is " ex officio " one of the lords spiritual of the house of lords .
he is one of the highest-ranking men in england and the highest ranking non-royal in the united kingdom's order of precedence .
since henry viii broke with rome , the archbishops of canterbury have been selected by the english ( british since the act of union in *num* ) monarch .
since the *ord* century , the appointment of archbishops of canterbury conventionally alternates between anglo-catholics and evangelicals .
the current archbishop , justin welby , the *ord* archbishop of canterbury , was enthroned at canterbury cathedral on *num* february *num* .
as archbishop he signs himself as " + justin cantuar " .
his predecessor , rowan williams , *ord* archbishop of canterbury , was enthroned at canterbury cathedral on *num* february *num* .
immediately prior to his appointment to canterbury , williams was the bishop of monmouth and archbishop of wales .
on *num* march *num* , williams announced he would be stepping down as archbishop of canterbury at the end of *num* to become master of magdalene college , cambridge .
in addition to his office , the archbishop also holds a number of other positions ; for example , he is joint president of the council of christians and jews in the united kingdom .
some positions he formally holds " ex officio " and others virtually so ( the incumbent of the day , although appointed personally , is appointed because of his office ) .
amongst these are : the archbishop of canterbury is also a president of churches together in england ( an ecumenical organisation ) .
geoffrey fisher , *ord* archbishop of canterbury , was the first since *num* to visit rome , where he held private talks with pope john xxiii in *num* .
in *num* , rowan williams became the first archbishop of canterbury to attend a papal funeral since the reformation .
he also attended the inauguration of pope benedict xvi .
the *ord* archbishop , donald coggan , was the first to attend a papal inauguration , that of pope john paul ii in *num* .
since *num* , the archbishop of canterbury has co-sponsored the alexandria middle east peace process with the grand mufti of egypt .
in july *num* , the archbishop attended a conference of christians , jews and muslims convened by the king of saudi arabia at which the notion of the " clash of civilizations " was rejected .
delegates agreed " on international guidelines for dialogue among the followers of religions and cultures .
" delegates said that " the deepening of moral values and ethical principles , which are common denominators among such followers , would help strengthen stability and achieve prosperity for all humans .
" it has been suggested that the roman province of britannia had four archbishops , seated at londinium ( london ) , eboracum ( york ) , lindum colonia ( lincoln ) and corinium dobunnorum ( cirencester ) .
however , in the *ord* and *ord* centuries britannia began to be overrun by pagan , germanic peoples who came to be known collectively as the anglo-saxons .
of the kingdoms they created , kent arguably had the closest links with european politics , trade and culture , because it was conveniently situated for communication with continental europe .
in the late *ord* century , king æthelberht of kent married a christian frankish princess named bertha , possibly before becoming king , and certainly a number of years before the arrival of the first christian mission to england .
he permitted the preaching of christianity .
the first archbishop of canterbury was st augustine ( not to be confused with st augustine of hippo ) , who arrived in kent in *num* ad , having been sent by pope gregory i on a mission to the english .
he was accepted by king æthelbert , on his conversion to christianity , about the year *num* .
it seems that pope gregory , ignorant of recent developments in the former roman province , including the spread of the pelagian heresy , had intended the new archiepiscopal sees for england to be established in london and york .
in the event , canterbury was chosen instead of london , owing to political circumstances .
since then the archbishops of canterbury have been referred to as occupying the chair of st .
augustine .
a gospel book believed to be directly associated with st augustine's mission survives in the parker library , corpus christi college , cambridge university , england .
catalogued as cambridge " manuscript *num* " , it has been positively dated to *ord* century italy and this bound book , the st augustine gospels , is still used during the swearing-in ceremony of new archbishops of canterbury .
before the break with papal authority in the *ord* century , the church of england was an integral part of the western european church .
since the break the church of england , an established national church , still considers itself part of the broader western catholic tradition ( although this is not accepted by the roman catholic church which regards anglicanism as schismatic and does not accept anglican holy orders as valid ) as well as being the " mother church " of the worldwide anglican communion .
the archbishop of canterbury exercises metropolitical ( or supervisory ) jurisdiction over the province of canterbury , which encompasses thirty of the forty-two dioceses of the church of england , with the rest falling within the province of york .
the four dioceses of wales were formerly also under the province of canterbury until *num* when they were transferred from the established church of england to the disestablished church in wales .
the archbishop of canterbury has a ceremonial provincial " curia " , or court , consisting of some of the senior bishops of his province .
the bishop of london—the most senior cleric of the church with the exception of the two archbishops—serves as canterbury's provincial dean , the bishop of winchester as chancellor , the bishop of lincoln as vice-chancellor , the bishop of salisbury as precentor , the bishop of worcester as chaplain and the bishop of rochester as cross-bearer .
along with primacy over the archbishop of york , the archbishop of canterbury also has a precedence of honour over the other bishops of the anglican communion .
he is recognised as " primus inter pares " , or first amongst equals .
he does not , however , exercise any direct authority in the provinces outside england , except in certain minor roles dictated by canon in those provinces ( for example , he is the judge in the event of an ecclesiastical prosecution against the archbishop of wales ) .
he does hold metropolitical authority over several extra-provincial anglican churches , and he serves as " ex officio " bishop of the falkland islands .
at present the archbishop has three suffragan bishops : the bishop of maidstone was previously a second " actual " suffragan bishop working in the diocese , until it was decided at the diocesan synod of november *num* that a new bishop will not be appointed .
the archbishop of canterbury and the archbishop of york are both styled as " the most reverend " ; retired archbishops are styled as " the right reverend " .
archbishops are , by convention , appointed to the privy council and may , therefore , also use the style of " the right honourable " for life ( unless they are later removed from the council ) .
in formal documents , the archbishop of canterbury is referred to as " the most reverend forenames , by divine providence lord archbishop of canterbury , primate of all england and metropolitan " .
in debates in the house of lords , the archbishop is referred to as " the most reverend primate , the archbishop of canterbury " .
" the right honourable " is not used in either instance .
he may also be formally addressed as " your grace"—or , more often these days , simply as " archbishop " , or " father " .
the surname of the archbishop of canterbury is not always used in formal documents ; often only the first name and see are mentioned .
the archbishop is legally entitled to sign his name as " cantuar " ( from the latin for canterbury ) .
the right to use a title as a legal signature is only permitted to bishops , peers of the realm and peers by courtesy .
the current archbishop of canterbury usually signs as " "+justin cantuar : " " .
in the english and welsh order of precedence , the archbishop of canterbury is ranked above all individuals in the realm , with the exception of the sovereign and members of the royal family .
immediately below him is the lord chancellor and then the archbishop of york .
the archbishop of canterbury awards academic degrees , commonly called " lambeth degrees " .
the archbishop of canterbury's official residence in london is lambeth palace .
he also has a residence , named the old palace , next to canterbury cathedral on the site of the medieval archbishop's palace .
the archbishops had palaces on the periphery of london and on the route between london and canterbury .
dollar dollar ( often represented by the dollar sign $ ) is the name of more than *num* currencies , including those of australia , canada , hong kong , jamaica , liberia , namibia , new zealand , singapore , taiwan , and the united states , whose us dollar is also the official currency of caribbean netherlands , east timor , ecuador , el salvador , federated states of micronesia , marshall islands , palau , panama , and zimbabwe .
one dollar is generally divided into *num* cents .
on *num* january *num* , the kingdom of bohemia began minting coins from silver mined locally in joachimsthal and marked on reverse with the bohemian lion .
the coins were called " joachimsthaler " , which became shortened in common usage to " thaler " or " taler " .
the german name " joachimsthal " literally means " joachim's valley " or " joachim's dale " .
this name found its way into other languages : czech and slovenian " tolar " , hungarian tallér , danish and norwegian " ( rigs ) daler " , swedish " ( riks ) daler " , icelandic " dalur " , dutch " ( rijks ) daalder or daler " , ethiopian " ታላሪ ( " talari " ) " , italian " tallero " , greek τάλληρον , τάλιρο , " tàlleron " , " tàliro " , polish " talar " , persian " dare " , as well as – via dutch – into english as " dollar " .
a later dutch coin also depicting a lion was called the " leeuwendaler or leeuwendaalder " , literally ' lion daler ' .
the dutch republic produced these coins to accommodate its booming international trade .
the " leeuwendaler " circulated throughout the middle east and was imitated in several german and italian cities .
this coin was also popular in the dutch east indies and in the dutch new netherland colony ( new york ) .
it was in circulation throughout the thirteen colonies during the *ord* and early *ord* centuries and was popularly known as " lion ( or lyon ) dollar " .
the currencies of romania and bulgaria are , to this day , ' lion ' ( " leu" / "lev " ) .
the modern american-english pronunciation of " dollar " is still remarkably close to the *ord* century dutch pronunciation of " daler " .
some well-worn examples circulating in the colonies were known as " dog dollars " .
spanish pesos – having the same weight and shape – came to be known as " spanish " dollars .
by the *ord* century , the lion dollar had been replaced by spanish dollar , the famous " pieces of eight " , which were distributed widely in the spanish colonies in the new world and in the philippines .
the sign is first attested in business correspondence in the 1770s as a scribal abbreviation " p " , referring to the spanish american peso , that is , the " spanish dollar " as it was known in british north america .
these late 18th- and early 19th-century manuscripts show that the " s " gradually came to be written over the " p " developing a close equivalent to the " $ " mark , and this new symbol was retained to refer to the american dollar as well , once this currency was adopted in *num* by the united states .
by the time of the american revolution , spanish dollars gained significance because they backed paper money authorized by the individual colonies and the continental congress .
common in the thirteen colonies , spanish dollars were even legal tender in one colony , virginia .
on april *num* , *num* , u .
s .
secretary of the treasury alexander hamilton reported to congress the precise amount of silver found in spanish dollar coins in common use in the states .
as a result , the united states dollar was defined as a unit of pure silver weighing *num* *num* / *ord* grains ( *num* .
*num* grams ) , or *num* grains of standard silver ( standard silver being defined as *num* , *num* parts fine silver to *num* parts alloy ) .
it was specified that the " money of account " of the united states should be expressed in those same " dollars " or parts thereof .
additionally , all lesser-denomination coins were defined as percentages of the dollar coin , such that a half-dollar was to contain half as much silver as a dollar , quarter-dollars would contain one-fourth as much , and so on .
in an act passed in january *num* , the dollar's alloy ( amount of non-silver metal present ) was set at *num* % .
subsequent coins would contain the same amount of pure silver as previously , but were reduced in overall weight ( to *num* .
*num* grains ) .
on february *num* , *num* , the quantity of silver in the lesser coins was reduced , with the effect that their denominations no longer represented their silver content relative to dollar coins .
various acts have subsequently been passed affecting the amount and type of metal in u .
s .
coins , so that today there is no legal definition of the term " dollar " to be found in u .
s .
statute .
currently the closest thing to a definition is found in united states code title *num* , section *num* , paragraph b , subsection *num* : " the secretary [ of the treasury ] shall sell silver under conditions the secretary considers appropriate for at least $1 .
*num* a fine troy ounce .
" however , the dollar's constitutional meaning has remained unchanged through the years ( " see " , united states constitution ) .
silver was mostly removed from u .
s .
coinage by *num* and the dollar became a free-floating fiat currency without a commodity backing defined in terms of real gold or silver .
the us mint continues to make silver $1-denomination coins , but these are not intended for general circulation .
the quantity of silver chosen in *num* to correspond to one dollar , namely , *num* .
*num* grains of pure silver , is very close to the geometric mean of one troy pound and one pennyweight .
in what follows , " dollar " will be used as a unit of mass .
a troy pound being *num* grains and a pennyweight being *num* times smaller , or *num* grains , the geometric mean is , to the nearest hundredth , *num* .
*num* grains .
this means that the ratio of a pound to a dollar ( *num* .
*num* ) roughly equals the ratio of a dollar to a pennyweight ( *num* .
*num* ) .
these ratios are also very close to the ratio of a gram to a grain : *num* .
*num* .
finally , in the united states , the ratio of the value of gold to the value of silver in the period from *num* to *num* averaged to about *num* .
*num* , being *num* from *num* to *num* and around *num* from *num* to *num* .
this is also nearly the value of the gold to silver ratio determined by isaac newton in *num* .
that these three ratios are all approximately equal has some interesting consequences .
let the gold to silver ratio be exactly *num* .
*num* .
then a pennyweight of gold , that is *num* grains of gold , is nearly equal in value to a dollar of silver ( *num* dwt of gold = $1 .
*num* of silver ) .
second , a dollar of gold is nearly equal in value to a pound of silver ( $1 of gold = *num* *num* / *num* grains of silver = *num* .
*num* lb of silver ) .
third , the number of grains in a dollar ( *num* .
*num* ) roughly equals the number of grams in a troy pound ( *num* .
*num* ) .
the actual process of defining the us silver dollar had nothing to do with any geometric mean .
the us government simply sampled all spanish milled dollars in circulation in *num* and arrived at the average weight in common use .
and this was *num* .
*num* grains of fine silver .
there are many quotes in the plays of william shakespeare referring to dollars as money .
coins known as " thistle dollars " were in use in scotland during the *ord* and *ord* centuries , and use of the english word , and perhaps even the use of the coin , may have begun at the university of st andrews .
this might be supported by a reference to the sum of " ten thousand dollars " in " macbeth " ( act i , scene ii ) ( an anachronism because the real macbeth , upon whom the play was based , lived in the *ord* century ) .
in *num* , a british five-shilling piece , or crown , was sometimes called " dollar " .
it was an overstruck spanish eight real coin ( the famous " piece of eight " ) , the original of which was known as a spanish dollar .
large numbers of these eight-real coins were captured during the napoleonic wars , hence their re-use by the bank of england .
they remained in use until *num* .
during world war ii , when the u .
s .
dollar was ( approximately ) valued at five shillings , the half crown ( 2s 6d ) acquired the nickname " half dollar " in the uk .
chinese demand for silver in the *ord* and early *ord* centuries led several countries , notably the united kingdom , united states and japan , to mint trade dollars , which were often of slightly different weights from comparable domestic coinage .
silver dollars reaching china ( whether spanish , trade , or other ) were often stamped with chinese characters known as " chop marks " , which indicated that that particular coin had been assayed by a well-known merchant and deemed genuine .
prior to *num* , the silver dollar circulated in many parts of the world , with a value in relation to the british gold sovereign of roughly $1 = 4s 2d ( 21p approx ) .
as a result of the decision of the german empire to stop minting silver " thaler " coins in *num* , in the wake of the franco-prussian war , the worldwide price of silver began to fall .
this resulted in the u .
s .
coinage act ( *num* ) which put the united states onto a ' de facto ' gold standard .
canada and newfoundland were already on the gold standard , and the result was that the value of the dollar in north america increased in relation to silver dollars being used elsewhere , particularly latin america and the far east .
by *num* , value of silver dollars had fallen to *num* percent of gold dollars .
following the abandonment of the gold standard by canada in *num* , the canadian dollar began to drift away from parity with the u .
s .
dollar .
it returned to parity a few times , but since the end of the bretton woods system of fixed exchange rates that was agreed to in *num* , the canadian dollar has been floating against the u .
s .
dollar .
the silver dollars of latin america and south east asia began to diverge from each other as well during the course of the *ord* century .
the straits dollar adopted a gold exchange standard in *num* after it had been forced to rise in value against other silver dollars in the region .
hence , by *num* , when china and hong kong came off the silver standard , the straits dollar was worth 2s 4d ( *num* .
5p approx ) sterling , whereas the hong kong dollar was worth only 1s 3d sterling ( 6p approx ) .
the term " dollar " has also been adopted by other countries for currencies which do not share a common history with other dollars .
many of these currencies adopted the name after moving from a £sd-based to a decimalized monetary system .
examples include the australian dollar , the new zealand dollar , the jamaican dollar , the cayman islands dollar , the fiji dollar , the namibian dollar , the rhodesian dollar , the zimbabwe dollar , and the solomon islands dollar .
conan the barbarian conan the barbarian ( also known as conan the cimmerian ) is a fictional sword and sorcery hero who originated in pulp fiction magazines and has since been adapted to books , comics , several films ( including " conan the barbarian " and " conan the destroyer " ) , television programs ( cartoon and live-action ) , video games , role-playing games , and other media .
the character was created by writer robert e .
howard in *num* in a series of fantasy stories published in " weird tales " magazine .
conan the barbarian was created by robert e .
howard in a series of fantasy stories published in " weird tales " in *num* .
for months , howard had been in search of a new character to market to the burgeoning pulp outlets of the early 1930s .
in october *num* , he submitted the short story " people of the dark " to clayton publications ' new magazine , " strange tales of mystery and terror " ( june *num* ) .
" people of the dark " is a remembrance story of " past lives " , and in its first-person narrative the protagonist describes one of his previous incarnations ; conan is a black-haired barbarian hero who swears by a deity called crom .
some howard scholars believe this conan to be a forerunner of the more famous character .
in february *num* , howard vacationed at a border town on the lower rio grande .
during this trip , he further conceived the character of conan and also wrote the poem " cimmeria " , much of which echoes specific passages in plutarch's " lives " .
according to some scholars , howard's conception of conan and the hyborian age may have originated in thomas bulfinch's " the outline of mythology " ( *num* ) which inspired howard to " coalesce into a coherent whole his literary aspirations and the strong physical , autobiographical elements underlying the creation of conan " .
having digested these prior influences after he returned from his trip , howard rewrote a rejected story , " by this axe i rule ! " ( may *num* ) , replacing his existing character kull of atlantis with his new hero , and retitling it " the phoenix on the sword " .
howard also wrote " the frost-giant's daughter " , inspired by the greek myth of daphne , and submitted both stories to " weird tales " magazine .
although " the frost-giant's daughter " was rejected , the magazine accepted " the phoenix on the sword " after it received the requested polishing .
"the phoenix on the sword " appeared in " weird tales " cover-dated december *num* .
editor farnsworth wright subsequently prompted howard to write an *num* , *ord* essay for personal use detailing " the hyborian age " , the fictional setting for conan .
using this essay as his guideline , howard began plotting " the tower of the elephant " , a new conan story that was the first to truly integrate his new conception of the hyborian world .
the publication and success of " the tower of the elephant " spurred howard to write many more conan stories for " weird tales " .
by the time of howard's suicide in *num* , he had written *num* complete stories , *num* of which had been published , as well as a number of unfinished fragments .
following howard's death , the copyright of the conan stories passed through several hands .
there is a report of a miss merriman who was helping doctor howard clean up robert's papers finding a written will .
she handed it to dr .
howard and it was never seen again .
as such , dr .
howard then inherited all of robert's writings and books .
as he aged , dr .
howard moved to ranger to help his friend dr .
kuykendall at his clinic .
he passed in *num* while living at the clinic and he left all his worldly goods to dr .
kuykendall for his kindness .
to be sure , dr .
kuykendall was ignorant of publishing and had no idea of the potential value of the writings he inherited and basically trusted the howard's old agent otis adelbert kline to guide him .
as this was just going into the wwii years the market was poor for this type of fiction so it netted him little except for the release of the *num* arkham house book skull-face & others .
however , the conan stories were so dynamic that they were never destined to be too long out of print .
in *num* , *num* years after the last conan tale appeared in weird tales , a returning g .
i .
marty greenberg , started gnome press publishing to preserve some of the great stories from the pulps and introduce new sf writing by such as asimov , heinlein and de camp .
between *num* to *num* gnome published all of the *num* original weird tales stories plus extra found and edited by de camp , and unsold eastern tales that de camp converted to conan tales plus one story submitted by swedish writer bjorn nyberg .
after that , it was but another *num* years until paperback versions appeared courtesy of lancer books , a deal brokered by l .
sprague de camp .
the lancers ran from *num* to *num* when lancer went bankrupt for some rather strange reasons , leaving the final conan paperback unpublished , although a cover proof had been created .
de camp with the help of lin carter had completed a number of drafts , synopses , and created new stories to add to conan's adventures .
the bankruptcy kept the rights to the stories in legal limbo for four years when prestige books acquired the assets from the auction .
of note were the highly successful images of conan by fantasy artist frank frazetta on most of the lancer covers .
in the meantime as of january *num* sphere books in the uk started printing the series of *num* books .
the latest printings of the sphere books found to date by mr .
scotty henderson , a howard scholar and researcher , is september *num* with the various books managing print runs of *num* to *num* printings .
shortly prestige approached ace books to print and distribute the books as they did not have the resources .
just prior to that , glenn lord , who had become the estate agent for the howard heirs found a loophole in the contracts and hired karl edward wagner to edit a series of original pure howard books via publisher berkley books .
they issued three volumes using the earliest published form of the texts from " weird tales " , but by this time conan properties inc .
had been formed and to put it mildly , de camp , one of the stake holders in cpi was very unhappy about this as he wanted his edited versions published .
he made no commission off the berkley books .
these books would have sold well if continued but in order to gain control again , de camp and the cpi lawyer made some deal to have ace books buy out prestige books and the rights were acquired by cpi from ace , while ace were guaranteed a very lucrative printing and distribution contract .
part of the deal also was that berkley stop publishing their books .
glenn lord , the copyright holders , de camp , and lawyer mr .
bronfmann were the board of cpi .
mr .
lord conceded probably due to the fact that the *num* books in the ace lineup represented a better deal for the heirs than the berkley deal at the end of the day .
after that the ace editions continued well into the 1990's before the printing contract ran out .
the latest printing to date found by mr .
scotty henderson was may *num* with at least two books , conan and conan the freebooter having *num* printings .
chances are there may have been no cutoff in the printing contract , just market conditions dictating that the print runs had decreased to the point that it wasn't worth do more as by that time they were marketing pastiches by other writers .
in *num* , the british publisher gollancz science fiction issued a two-volume , complete edition of howard's conan stories as part of its fantasy masterworks imprint , which included several stories that had never seen print in their original form .
the gollancz edition mostly used the versions of the stories as published in " weird tales " .
the two volumes were combined and the stories resorted into chronological order as " the complete chronicles of conan : centenary edition " ( gollancz science fiction , *num* ; edited and with an afterword by steve jones ) .
in *num* , another british publisher , wandering star books , made an effort both to restore howard's original manuscripts and to provide a more scholarly and historical view of the conan stories .
it published hardcover editions in england , which were republished in the united states by the del rey imprint of ballantine books .
the first book , " conan of cimmeria : volume one ( 1932–1933 ) " ( *num* ; published in the us as " the coming of conan the cimmerian " ) includes howard's notes on his fictional setting , as well as letters and poems concerning the genesis of his ideas .
this was followed by " conan of cimmeria : volume two ( *num* ) " ( *num* ; published in the us as " the bloody crown of conan " ) and " conan of cimmeria : volume three ( 1935–1936 ) " ( *num* ; published in the us as " the conquering sword of conan " ) .
these three volumes combined include all of the original , unedited conan stories .
the various stories of conan the barbarian occur in the pseudo-historical " hyborian age " , set after the destruction of atlantis and before the rise of any known ancient civilization .
this is a specific epoch in a fictional timeline created by howard for many of the low fantasy tales of his artificial legendary .
the reasons behind the invention of the hyborian age were perhaps commercial : howard had an intense love for history and historical dramas ; however , at the same time , he recognized the difficulties and the time-consuming research work needed in maintaining historical accuracy—and moreover , the poorly-stocked libraries in the rural part of texas where howard lived just didn't have the material needed for such historical research .
by conceiving a timeless setting—"a " vanished " age"—and by carefully choosing names that resembled human history , howard shrewdly avoided the problem of historical anachronisms and his need for lengthy exposition .
according to " the phoenix on the sword " , the adventures of conan take place " between the years when the oceans drank atlantis and the gleaming cities , and the years of the rise of the sons of aryas .
" conan is a cimmerian .
from the writings of robert e .
howard ( the hyborian age among others ) it is known that his cimmerians are based on the celts or perhaps the historic cimmerians , based on the described geography and the existence of said people .
he was born on a battlefield and is the son of a village blacksmith .
conan matured quickly as a youth and , by age fifteen , he was already a respected warrior who had participated in the destruction of the aquilonian fortress of venarium .
after its demise , he was struck by wanderlust and began the adventures chronicled by howard , encountering skulking monsters , evil wizards , tavern wenches , and beautiful princesses .
he roamed throughout the hyborian age nations as a thief , outlaw , mercenary , and pirate .
as he grew older , he began commanding vast units of warriors and escalating his ambitions .
in his forties , he seized the crown of the tyrannical king of aquilonia , the most powerful kingdom of the hyborian age , having strangled the previous ruler on the steps of his own throne .
conan's adventures often result in him performing heroic feats , though his motivation for doing so is largely to protect his own survival or for personal gain .
a conspicuous element of conan's character is his chivalry .
he is extremely reluctant to fight women ( even when they fight him ) and has a strong tendency to save damsels in distress .
in " jewels of gwahlur " , he has to make a split-second decision whether to save the dancing girl muriela or the chest of priceless gems which he spent months in search of .
so , without hesitation , he rescues muriela and allows for the treasure to be irrevocably lost .
in " the black stranger " , conan saves the exile zingaran lady belesa at considerable risk to himself , giving her as a parting gift his fortune in gems big enough to have a comfortable and wealthy life in zingara , while asking for no sexual favors in return .
reviewer jennifer bard also noted that when conan is in a pirate crew or a robber gang led by another male , his tendency is to subvert and undermine the leader's authority , and eventually supplant ( and often , kill ) him ( e .
g .
" pool of the black one " , " a witch shall be born " , " shadows in the moonlight " ) .
conversely , in " queen of the black coast " , it is noted that conan " generally agreed to belit's plan .
hers was the mind that directed their raids , his the arm that carried out her ideas .
it was a good life .
" and at the end of " red nails " , conan and valeria seem to be headed towards a reasonably amicable piratical partnership " .
george baxter noted that " conan's recorded history mentions him as being prominently involved , at one time or another , with four different pirate fraternities , on two different seas , as well being a noted leader of land robbers at three different locales .
yet , we hardly ever see him involved in , well , robbing people .
to be sure , he speaks about it often and with complete candor : " we kozaks took to plundering the outlying dominions of koth , zamora , and turan impartially " he says in " shadows in the moonlight " .
but that was " before " the story began .
and " we're bound for waters where the seaports are fat , and the merchant ships are crammed with plunder ! " conan declares at the end of " the pool of the black one " .
but this plundering will take place " after " the story ends .
when we see conan onstage , we see him do many other things : he intervenes in the politics and dynastic struggles of various kingdoms ; he hunts for hidden treasure ; he explores desert islands and lost cities ; he fights countless terrible monsters and evil sorcerers ; he saves countless beautiful women and makes them fall in love with him .
.
.
what we virtually never see conan do is engage in the proper business of an armed robber , on land or by sea—which is to attack people who never threatened or provoked you , take away their possessions by main force , and run your sword through them if they dare to resist .
a bit messy business , that .
armchair adventurers , who like to enjoy a good yarn in the perfect safety and comfort of their suburban homes , might not have liked to read it .
" conan has " sullen " , " smoldering " , and " volcanic " blue eyes with a black " square-cut mane " .
howard once describes him as having a hairy chest and , while comic book interpretations often portray conan as wearing a loincloth or other minimalist clothing to give him a more barbaric image , howard describes the character as wearing whatever garb is typical for the kingdom and culture in which conan finds himself .
howard never gave a strict height or weight for conan in a story , only describing him in loose terms like " giant " and " massive " .
in the tales , no human is ever described as being stronger than conan , although several are mentioned as taller ( such as the strangler baal-pteor ) or of larger bulk .
in a letter to p .
schuyler miller and john d .
clark in *num* , only three months before howard's death , conan is described as standing and weighing when he takes part in an attack on venarium at only *num* years old , though being far from fully grown .
conan himself says in " beyond the black river " that he had " .
.
.
not yet seen *num* snows " .
although conan is muscular , howard frequently compares his agility and way of moving to that of a panther ( see , for instance , " jewels of gwahlur " , " beyond the black river " , or " rogues in the house " ) .
his skin is frequently characterized as bronzed from constant exposure to the sun .
in his younger years , he is often depicted wearing a light chain shirt and a horned helmet , though appearances vary with different stories .
during his reign as king of aquilonia , conan was howard imagined the cimmerians as a pre-celtic people with mostly black hair and blue or grey eyes .
ethnically , the cimmerians to which conan belongs are descendants of the atlanteans , though they don't remember their ancestry .
in his fictional historical essay " the hyborian age " , howard describes how the people of atlantis—the land where his character king kull originated—had to move east after a great cataclysm changed the face of the world and sank their island , settling where ireland and scotland would eventually be located .
thus they are ( in howard's work ) the ancestors of the irish and scottish ( the celtic gaels ) and not the picts , the other ancestor of modern scots who also appear in howard's work .
in the same work , howard also described how the cimmerians eventually moved south and east after the age of conan ( presumably in the vicinity of the black sea , where the historical cimmerians dwelt ) .
despite his brutish appearance , conan uses his brains as well as his brawn .
the cimmerian is a highly skilled warrior , possibly without peer with a sword , but his travels have given him vast experience in other trades , especially as a thief .
he is also a talented commander , tactician , and strategist , as well as a born leader .
in addition , conan has advanced knowledge of languages and codes and is able to recognize , or even decipher , certain ancient or secret signs and writings .
for example , in " jewels of gwahlur " howard states : " in his roaming about the world the giant adventurer had picked up a wide smattering of knowledge , particularly including the speaking and reading of many alien tongues .
many a sheltered scholar would have been astonished at the cimmerian's linguistic abilities .
" he also has incredible stamina , enabling him to go without sleep for a few days .
in " a witch shall be born " , conan fights armed men until he is overwhelmed , captured , and crucified , and goes an entire night and day without water .
however , conan still possesses the strength to pull the nails from his feet , while hoisting himself into a horse's saddle and riding for ten miles .
another noticeable trait is his sense of humor , largely absent in the comics and movies , but very much a part of howard's original vision of the character ( particularly apparent in " xuthal of the dusk " , also known as " the slithering shadow .
" ) his sense of humor can also be rather grimly ironic , as was demonstrated by how he unleashes his own version of justice on the treacherous—and ill-fated—innkeeper aram baksh in " shadows in zamboula " .
he is a loyal friend to those true to him , with a barbaric code of conduct that often marks him as more honorable than the more sophisticated people he meets in his travels .
indeed , his straightforward nature and barbarism are constants in all the tales .
conan is a formidable combatant both armed and unarmed .
with his back to the wall , conan is capable of engaging and killing opponents by the score .
this is seen in several stories , such as " queen of the black coast " , " the scarlet citadel " , and " a witch shall be born " .
conan is not superhuman , though ; he needed the providential help of zelata's wolf to defeat four nemedian soldiers in howard's novel " the hour of the dragon " .
some of his hardest victories have come from fighting single opponents of inhuman strength : one such as thak , an ape-like humanoid from " rogues in the house " , or the strangler baal-pteor in " shadows in zamboula " .
conan is far from untouchable and has been captured or defeated several times ( on one occasion , knocking himself out drunkenly after running into a wall ) .
howard frequently corresponded with h .
p .
lovecraft , and the two would sometimes insert references or elements of each other's settings in their works .
later editors reworked many of the original conan stories by howard , thus diluting this connection .
nevertheless , many of howard's unedited conan stories are arguably part of the cthulhu mythos .
additionally , many of the conan stories by howard , de camp , and carter used geographical place names from clark ashton smith's hyperborean cycle .
a number of untitled synopses for conan stories also exist .
the character of conan has proven durably popular , resulting in conan stories by later writers such as poul anderson , leonard carpenter , lin carter , l .
sprague de camp , roland j .
green , john c .
hocking , robert jordan , sean a .
moore , björn nyberg , andrew j .
offutt , steve perry , john maddox roberts , harry turtledove , and karl edward wagner .
some of these writers have finished incomplete conan manuscripts by howard .
others were created by rewriting howard stories which originally featured entirely different characters from entirely different milieus .
most , however , are completely original works .
in total , more than fifty novels and dozens of short stories featuring the conan character have been written by authors other than howard .
the gnome press edition ( 1950–1957 ) was the first hardcover collection of howard's conan stories , including all the original howard material known to exist at the time , some left unpublished in his lifetime .
the later volumes contain some stories rewritten by l .
sprague de camp ( like " the treasure of tranicos " ) , including several non-conan howard stories , mostly historical exotica situated in the levant at the time of the crusades , which he turned into conan yarns .
the gnome edition also issued the first conan story written by an author other than howard—the final volume published , which is by björn nyberg and revised by de camp .
the lancer / ace editions ( 1966–1977 ) , under the direction of de camp and lin carter , were the first comprehensive paperbacks , compiling the material from the gnome press series together in chronological order with all the remaining original howard material , including that left unpublished in his lifetime and fragments and outlines .
these were completed by de camp and carter .
the series also included howard stories originally featuring other protagonists that were rewritten by de camp as conan stories .
new conan stories written entirely by de camp and carter were added as well .
lancer books went out of business before bringing out the entire series , the publication of which was completed by ace books .
eight of the eventual twelve volumes published featured dynamic cover paintings by frank frazetta that , for many fans , presented the definitive , iconic impression of conan and his world .
for decades to come , most other portrayals of the cimmerian and his imitators were heavily influenced by the cover paintings of this series .
most editions after the lancer / ace series have been of either the original howard stories or conan material by others , but not both .
the exception are the ace maroto editions ( 1978–1981 ) , which include both new material by other authors and older material by howard , though the latter are some of the non-conan tales rewritten as conan stories by de camp .
notable later editions of the original howard conan stories include the donald m .
grant editions ( 1974–1989 , incomplete ) ; berkley editions ( *num* ) ; gollancz editions ( 2000–2006 ) , and wandering star / del rey editions ( 2003–2005 ) .
later series of new conan material include the bantam editions ( 1978–1982 ) and tor editions ( 1982–2004 ) .
in an attempt to provide a coherent timeline which fit the numerous adventures of conan penned by robert e .
howard and later writers , various " conan chronologies " have been prepared by many people from the 1930s onward .
note that no consistent timeline has yet accommodated every single conan story .
the following are the principal theories that have been advanced over the years .
the very first conan cinematic project was planned by edward summer .
summer envisioned a series of conan films , much like the james bond franchise .
he outlined six stories for this film series , but none were ever made .
an original screenplay by summer and roy thomas was written , but their lore-authentic screen story was never filmed .
however , the resulting film , " conan the barbarian " ( *num* ) , was a combination of director john milius ' ideas and plots from conan stories ( written also by howard's successors , notably lin carter and l .
sprague de camp ) .
the addition of nietzschean motto and conan's life philosophy were crucial for bringing the spirit of howard's literature to the screen .
the plot of " conan the barbarian " ( *num* ) begins with conan being enslaved by the vanir raiders of thulsa doom , a malevolent warlord who is responsible for the slaying of conan's parents and the genocide of his people .
later , thulsa doom becomes a cult leader of a religion that worships set , a snake god .
the vengeful conan , the archer subotai and the thief valeria set out on a quest to rescue a princess held captive by thulsa doom .
the film was directed by john milius and produced by dino de laurentiis .
the character of conan was played by arnold schwarzenegger and was his break-through role as an actor .
this film was followed by a less popular sequel , " conan the destroyer " in *num* .
this sequel was a more typical fantasy-genre film and was even less faithful to howard's conan stories , being just a picaresque story of an assorted bunch of adventurers .
the third film in the " conan " trilogy was planned for *num* to be titled " conan the conqueror " .
the director was to be either guy hamilton or john guillermin .
since arnold schwarzenegger was committed to the film " predator " and de laurentiis's contract with the star had expired after his obligation to " red sonja " and " raw deal " , he wasn't keen to negotiate a new one ; thus the third conan film sank into development hell .
the script was eventually turned into " kull the conqueror " .
there were rumors in the late 1990s of another conan sequel , a story about an older conan titled " king conan : crown of iron " , but schwarzenegger's election in *num* as governor of california ended this project .
warner bros .
spent seven years trying to get the project off the ground .
however , in june *num* the rights reverted to paradox entertainment , though all drafts made under warner remained with them .
in august *num* , it was announced that millennium films had acquired the rights to the project .
production was aimed for a spring *num* start , with the intention of having stories more faithful to the robert e .
howard creation .
in june *num* , millennium hired marcus nispel to direct .
in january *num* , jason momoa was selected for the role of conan .
the film was released in august *num* , and met poor critical reviews and box office results .
in *num* , producers chris morgan and frederick malmberg announced plans for a sequel to the *num* " conan the barbarian " titled " the legend of conan " , with arnold schwarzenegger reprising his role as conan .
a year later , " deadline " reported that andrea berloff would write the script .
years passed since the initial announcement as schwarzenegger worked on other films , but as late as *num* , schwarzenegger affirmed his enthusiasm for making the film , saying , " interest is high .
.
.
but we are not rushing .
" the script was finished , and schwarzenegger and morgan were meeting with possible directors .
in april *num* , producer chris morgan stated that universal had dropped the project , although there was a possibility of a tv show .
the story of the film was supposed to be set *num* years after the first , with some inspiration from clint eastwood's " unforgiven " .
there have been three television series related to conan : conan the barbarian has appeared in comics nearly non-stop since *num* .
the comics are arguably , apart from the books , the vehicle that had the greatest influence on the longevity and popularity of the character .
aside from an earlier and unofficial conan comic published in mexico , the two main publishers of conan comics have been marvel comics and dark horse comics .
marvel comics launched " conan the barbarian " ( 1970–1993 ) and the classic " savage sword of conan " ( 1974–1995 ) .
dark horse launched their " conan " series in *num* .
dark horse comics is currently publishing compilations of the 1970s marvel comics series in trade paperback format .
barack obama , former president of the united states , is a collector of conan the barbarian comic books and a big fan of the character and appeared as a character in a comic book called " barack the barbarian " from devil's due .
marvel comics introduced a relatively lore-faithful version of conan the barbarian in *num* with " conan the barbarian " , written by roy thomas and illustrated by barry windsor-smith .
smith was succeeded by penciller john buscema , while thomas continued to write for many years .
later writers included j .
m .
dematteis , bruce jones , michael fleisher , doug moench , jim owsley , alan zelenetz , chuck dixon and don kraar .
in *num* , " conan the barbarian " series spawned the more adult-oriented , black-and-white comics magazine " savage sword of conan " , written by thomas with art mostly by buscema or alfredo alcala .
marvel also published several graphic novels starring the character , and a handbook with detailed information about the hyborian world .
the marvel conan stories were also adapted as a newspaper comic strip which appeared daily and sunday from *num* september *num* to *num* april *num* .
originally written by roy thomas and illustrated by john buscema , the strip was continued by several different marvel artists and writers .
dark horse comics began their comic adaptation of the conan saga in *num* .
entitled simply " conan " , the series was first written by kurt busiek and pencilled by cary nord .
tim truman replaced busiek when busiek signed an exclusive contract with dc comics ; however , busiek issues were sometimes used for filler .
this series is an interpretation of the original conan material by robert e .
howard with no connection whatsoever to the earlier marvel comics or any conan story not written or envisioned by howard supplemented by wholly original material .
a second series , " conan the cimmerian " was released in *num* by tim truman ( writer ) and tomás giorello ( artist ) .
the series ran for twenty-six issues , including an introductory " zero " issue .
dark horse's third series , " " , began in december *num* by roy thomas ( writer ) and mike hawthorne ( artist ) and ran for twelve issues .
a fourth series , " conan the barbarian " , began in february *num* by brian wood ( writer ) and becky cloonan ( artist ) .
it ran for twenty-five issues , and expanded on robert e .
howard's " queen of the black coast " .
a fifth series , " conan the avenger " , began in april *num* by fred van lente ( writer ) and brian ching ( artist ) .
it ran for twenty-five issues , and expanded on robert e .
howard's the snout in the dark and a witch shall be born .
dark horse's sixth series , " conan the slayer " , began in july *num* by cullen bunn ( writer ) and sergio dávila ( artist ) .
seven video games have been released based on the conan mythos .
tsr , inc .
signed a license agreement in *num* to publish conan-related gaming material : in *num* steve jackson games acquired a conan license and started publishing conan solo adventures for its " gurps " generic system of rules as of *num* and a " gurps conan " core rulebook in *num* : in *num* the british company mongoose publishing bought a license and acquired in turn the rights to make use of the conan gaming franchise , publishing a conan role-playing game from *num* until *num* .
the game ran the ogl system of rules that mongoose established for its " ogl series " of games : in *num* mongoose publishing dropped the conan license .
in february *num* , another british company , modiphius entertainment , acquired the license , announcing plans to put out a new conan role-playing game in august of that year .
actually , the core rulebook was not launched ( via kickstarter ) until a whole year later , in february *num* , reaching by far all funds needed for publication .
long after the kickstarter ended the core rulebook was launched in pdf format on january the *ord* , *num* .
chalcedonian definition the chalcedonian definition ( also called the chalcedonian creed ) was adopted at the council of chalcedon in ad *num* .
chalcedon was an early centre of christianity located in asia minor ( modern turkey ) .
the council was the fourth of the ecumenical councils that are accepted by chalcedonian churches which include the eastern orthodox , catholic , and most protestant churches .
it was the first council not to be recognised by any oriental orthodox church ; these churches may be classified as non-chalcedonian .
the council of chalcedon was summoned to consider the christological question in light of the " one-nature " view of christ proposed by eutyches , archimandrite at constantinople , which prevailed at the second council of ephesus in *num* , sometimes referred to as the " robber synod " .
the council first solemnly ratified the nicene creed adopted in *num* , and that creed as amended by the first council of constantinople in *num* .
it also confirmed the authority of two synodical letters of cyril of alexandria and the letter of pope leo i to flavian of constantinople .
the full text of the definition reaffirms the decisions of the council of ephesus , the pre-eminence of the creed of nicaea ( *num* ) and the further definitions of the council of constantinople ( *num* ) in one of the translations into english , the key section , emphasizing the double nature of christ ( human and divine ) , runs : following , then , the holy fathers , we all unanimously teach that our lord jesus christ is to us one and the same son , the self-same perfect in godhead , the self-same perfect in manhood ; " truly god and truly man " ; the self-same of a rational soul and body ; co-essential with the father according to the godhead , the self-same co-essential with us according to the manhood ; like us in all things , sin apart ; before the ages begotten of the father as to the godhead , but in the last days , the self-same , for us and for our salvation ( born ) of mary the virgin theotokos as to the manhood ; one and the same christ , son , lord , only-begotten ; acknowledged in two natures unconfusedly , unchangeably , indivisibly , inseparably ; the difference of the natures being in no way removed because of the union , but rather the properties of each nature being preserved , and ( both ) concurring into one person and one hypostasis ; not as though he were parted or divided into two persons , but one and the self-same son and only-begotten god , word , lord , jesus christ ; even as from the beginning the prophets have taught concerning him , and as the lord jesus christ himself hath taught us , and as the symbol of the fathers hath handed down to us .
the definition implicitly addressed a number of popular heretical beliefs .
the reference to " co-essential with the father " was directed at arianism ; " co-essential with us " is directed at apollinarianism ; " two natures unconfusedly , unchangeably " refutes eutychianism ; and " indivisibly , inseparably " is against nestorianism .
the chalcedonian definition was written amid controversy between the western and eastern churches over the meaning of the incarnation ( see christology ) .
the western church readily accepted the creed , but some eastern churches did not .
political disturbances prevented the armenian bishops from attending .
even though chalcedon reaffirmed the third council’s condemnation of nestorius , the non-chalcedonians always suspected that the chalcedonian definition tended towards nestorianism .
this was in part because of the restoration of a number of bishops deposed at the second council of ephesus , bishops who had previously indicated what appeared to be support of nestorian positions .
the coptic church of alexandria dissented , holding to cyril of alexandria's preferred formula for the oneness of christ's nature in the incarnation of god the word as " out of two natures " .
cyril's language is not consistent and he may have countenanced the view that it is possible to contemplate in theory two natures after the incarnation , but the church of alexandria felt that the definition should have stated that christ be acknowledged " out of two natures " rather than " in two natures " .
the definition defines that christ is " acknowledged in two natures " , which " come together into one person and one hypostasis " .
the formal definition of " two natures " in christ was understood by the critics of the council at the time , and is understood by many historians and theologians today , to side with western and antiochene christology and to diverge from the teaching of cyril of alexandria , who always stressed that christ is " one " .
however , a modern analysis of the sources of the creed ( by a .
de halleux , in " revue theologique de louvain " *num* , *num* ) and a reading of the acts , or proceedings , of the council show that the bishops considered cyril the great authority and that even the language of " two natures " derives from him .
this miaphysite position , historically characterised by chalcedonian followers as " monophysitism " though this is denied by the dissenters , formed the basis for the distinction from other churches of the coptic church of egypt and ethiopia and the " jacobite " churches of syria , and the armenian apostolic church ( see oriental orthodoxy ) .
transport in ecuador transportation in ecuador uses six transportation methods to transport passengers and freight ( more specifically , oil ) .
they are aviation , highways , pipelines , ports and harbors , railways , and waterways *num* ( *num* est .
) the sierra region still plays an important role in transportation throughout the country .
the pan-american highway crosses it from north to south .
ecuador has managed to update some roads into 4-lane freeways : : " *num* ships ( or over ) totaling / by type : " ( *num* est .
) "foreign-owned : " *num* "registered in other countries " *num* "total : " *num* km ( single track ) gauge : " *num* km gauge there is a proposed rail connection with colombia .
on *num* july *num* a meeting took place between venezuela , colombia and ecuador regarding a railway for freight and passengers to link the three countries , and linking the pacific with the atlantic also .
there is no railway service to peru .
down down is the relative vertical direction opposed to up .
elvis presley elvis aaron presley ( january *num* , *num* – august *num* , *num* ) was an american singer and actor .
regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the *ord* century , he is often referred to as the " king of rock and roll " or simply " the king " .
presley was born in tupelo , mississippi , and relocated to memphis , tennessee , with his family when he was *num* years old .
his music career began there in *num* , recording at sun records with producer sam phillips , who wanted to bring the sound of african-american music to a wider audience .
accompanied by guitarist scotty moore and bassist bill black , presley was a pioneer of rockabilly , an uptempo , backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues .
in *num* , drummer d .
j .
fontana joined to complete the lineup of presley's classic quartet and rca victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by colonel tom parker , who would manage him for more than two decades .
presley's first rca single , " heartbreak hotel " , was released in january *num* and became a number one hit in the united states .
with a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records , he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll .
his energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style , combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations , made him enormously popular—and controversial .
in november *num* , presley made his film debut in " love me tender " .
drafted into military service in *num* , presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work .
he held few concerts however , and guided by parker , proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making hollywood films and soundtrack albums , most of them critically derided .
in *num* , following a seven-year break from live performances , he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special " elvis " , which led to an extended las vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours .
in *num* , presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world , " aloha from hawaii " .
years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health , and he died suddenly in *num* at his graceland estate at the age of *num* .
presley is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the *ord* century .
commercially successful in many genres , including pop , country , blues , and gospel , he is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music .
he won three competitive grammys , received the grammy lifetime achievement award at age *num* , and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame .
elvis presley was born on january *num* , *num* , in tupelo , mississippi , to gladys love presley ( " née " smith ) in the two-room shotgun house built by his father , vernon elvis presley , in preparation for the birth .
jesse garon presley , his identical twin brother , was delivered *num* minutes before him , stillborn .
presley became close to both parents and formed an especially close bond with his mother .
the family attended an assembly of god church , where he found his initial musical inspiration .
on his mother's side presley's ancestry was scots-irish , with some french norman .
gladys and the rest of the family apparently believed that her great-great-grandmother , morning dove white , was cherokee ; the biography by elaine dundy supports the idea , but at least one genealogy researcher has contested it on multiple grounds .
vernon's forebears were of german or scottish origin .
gladys was regarded by relatives and friends as the dominant member of the small family .
vernon moved from one odd job to the next , evincing little ambition .
the family often relied on help from neighbors and government food assistance .
in *num* , they lost their home after vernon was found guilty of altering a check written by his landowner and sometime employer .
he was jailed for eight months , while gladys and elvis moved in with relatives .
in september *num* , presley entered first grade at east tupelo consolidated , where his teachers regarded him as " average " .
he was encouraged to enter a singing contest after impressing his schoolteacher with a rendition of red foley's country song " old shep " during morning prayers .
the contest , held at the mississippi–alabama fair and dairy show on october *num* , *num* , was his first public performance .
the ten-year-old presley was dressed as a cowboy ; he stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang " old shep " .
he recalled placing fifth .
a few months later , presley received his first guitar for his birthday ; he had hoped for something else—by different accounts , either a bicycle or a rifle .
over the following year , he received basic guitar lessons from two of his uncles and the new pastor at the family's church .
presley recalled , " i took the guitar , and i watched people , and i learned to play a little bit .
but i would never sing in public .
i was very shy about it .
" in september *num* , presley entered a new school , milam , for sixth grade ; he was regarded as a loner .
the following year , he began bringing his guitar to school on a daily basis .
he played and sang during lunchtime , and was often teased as a " trashy " kid who played hillbilly music .
by then , the family was living in a largely black neighborhood .
presley was a devotee of mississippi slim's show on the tupelo radio station welo .
he was described as " crazy about music " by slim's younger brother , who was one of presley's classmates and often took him into the station .
slim supplemented presley's guitar tuition by demonstrating chord techniques .
when his protégé was twelve years old , slim scheduled him for two on-air performances .
presley was overcome by stage fright the first time , but succeeded in performing the following week .
in november *num* , the family moved to memphis , tennessee .
after residing for nearly a year in rooming houses , they were granted a two-bedroom apartment in the public housing complex known as the lauderdale courts .
enrolled at l .
c .
humes high school , presley received only a c in music in eighth grade .
when his music teacher told him that he had no aptitude for singing , he brought in his guitar the next day and sang a recent hit , " keep them cold icy fingers off me " , in an effort to prove otherwise .
a classmate later recalled that the teacher " agreed that elvis was right when he said that she didn't appreciate his kind of singing " .
he was usually too shy to perform openly , and was occasionally bullied by classmates who viewed him as a " mama's boy " .
in *num* , he began practicing guitar regularly under the tutelage of lee denson , a neighbor two and a half years his senior .
they and three other boys—including two future rockabilly pioneers , brothers dorsey and johnny burnette—formed a loose musical collective that played frequently around the courts .
that september , he began working as an usher at loew's state theater .
other jobs followed : precision tool , loew's again , and marl metal products .
during his junior year , presley began to stand out more among his classmates , largely because of his appearance : he grew his sideburns and styled his hair with rose oil and vaseline .
in his free time , he would head down to beale street , the heart of memphis's thriving blues scene , and gaze longingly at the wild , flashy clothes in the windows of lansky brothers .
by his senior year , he was wearing those clothes .
overcoming his reticence about performing outside the lauderdale courts , he competed in humes's annual " minstrel " show in april *num* .
singing and playing guitar , he opened with " till i waltz again with you " , a recent hit for teresa brewer .
presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation : " i wasn't popular in school .
.
.
i failed music—only thing i ever failed .
and then they entered me in this talent show .
.
.
when i came onstage i heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth , ' cause nobody knew i even sang .
it was amazing how popular i became after that .
" presley , who received no formal music training and could not read music , studied and played by ear .
he also frequented record stores that provided jukeboxes and listening booths to customers .
he knew all of hank snow's songs , and he loved records by other country singers such as roy acuff , ernest tubb , ted daffan , jimmie rodgers , jimmie davis , and bob wills .
the southern gospel singer jake hess , one of his favorite performers , was a significant influence on his ballad-singing style .
he was a regular audience member at the monthly all-night singings downtown , where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of african-american spiritual music .
he adored the music of black gospel singer sister rosetta tharpe .
like some of his peers , he may have attended blues venues—of necessity , in the segregated south , only on nights designated for exclusively white audiences .
he certainly listened to the regional radio stations , such as wdia-am , that played " race records " : spirituals , blues , and the modern , backbeat-heavy sound of rhythm and blues .
many of his future recordings were inspired by local african-american musicians such as arthur crudup and rufus thomas .
b .
b .
king recalled that he had known presley before he was popular , when they both used to frequent beale street .
by the time he graduated from high school in june *num* , presley had already singled out music as his future .
in august *num* , presley checked into the offices of sun records .
he aimed to pay for a few minutes of studio time to record a two-sided acetate disc : " my happiness " and " that's when your heartaches begin " .
he later claimed that he intended the record as a gift for his mother , or that he was merely interested in what he " sounded like " , although there was a much cheaper , amateur record-making service at a nearby general store .
biographer peter guralnick argued that he chose sun in the hope of being discovered .
asked by receptionist marion keisker what kind of singer he was , presley responded , " i sing all kinds .
" when she pressed him on who he sounded like , he repeatedly answered , " i don't sound like nobody .
" after he recorded , sun boss sam phillips asked keisker to note down the young man's name , which she did along with her own commentary : " good ballad singer .
hold .
" in january *num* , presley cut a second acetate at sun records—"i'll never stand in your way " and " it wouldn't be the same without you"—but again nothing came of it .
not long after , he failed an audition for a local vocal quartet , the songfellows .
he explained to his father , " they told me i couldn't sing .
" songfellow jim hamill later claimed that he was turned down because he did not demonstrate an ear for harmony at the time .
in april , presley began working for the crown electric company as a truck driver .
his friend ronnie smith , after playing a few local gigs with him , suggested he contact eddie bond , leader of smith's professional band , which had an opening for a vocalist .
bond rejected him after a tryout , advising presley to stick to truck driving " because you're never going to make it as a singer " .
phillips , meanwhile , was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom sun focused .
as keisker reported , " over and over i remember sam saying , ' if i could find a white man who had the negro sound and the negro feel , i could make a billion dollars .
' " in june , he acquired a demo recording by jimmy sweeney of a ballad , " without you " , that he thought might suit the teenage singer .
presley came by the studio , but was unable to do it justice .
despite this , phillips asked presley to sing as many numbers as he knew .
he was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians , guitarist winfield " scotty " moore and upright bass player bill black , to work something up with presley for a recording session .
the session , held the evening of july *num* , proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night .
as they were about to abort and go home , presley took his guitar and launched into a *num* blues number , arthur crudup's " that's all right " .
moore recalled , " all of a sudden , elvis just started singing this song , jumping around and acting the fool , and then bill picked up his bass , and he started acting the fool , too , and i started playing with them .
sam , i think , had the door to the control booth open .
.
.
he stuck his head out and said , ' what are you doing ? ' and we said , ' we don't know .
' ' well , back up , ' he said , ' try to find a place to start , and do it again .
' " phillips quickly began taping ; this was the sound he had been looking for .
three days later , popular memphis dj dewey phillips played " that's all right " on his " red , hot , and blue " show .
listeners began phoning in , eager to find out who the singer really was .
the interest was such that phillips played the record repeatedly during the remaining two hours of his show .
interviewing presley on air , phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed that he was black .
during the next few days , the trio recorded a bluegrass number , bill monroe's " blue moon of kentucky " , again in a distinctive style and employing a jury rigged echo effect that sam phillips dubbed " slapback " .
a single was pressed with " that's all right " on the a side and " blue moon of kentucky " on the reverse .
the trio played publicly for the first time on july *num* at the bon air club—presley still sporting his child-size guitar .
at the end of the month , they appeared at the overton park shell , with slim whitman headlining .
a combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness at playing before a large crowd led presley to shake his legs as he performed : his wide-cut pants emphasized his movements , causing young women in the audience to start screaming .
moore recalled , " during the instrumental parts , he would back off from the mike and be playing and shaking , and the crowd would just go wild " .
black , a natural showman , whooped and rode his bass , hitting double licks that presley would later remember as " really a wild sound , like a jungle drum or something " .
soon after , moore and black left their old band , the starlite wranglers , to play with presley regularly , and dj / promoter bob neal became the trio's manager .
from august through october , they played frequently at the eagle's nest club and returned to sun studio for more recording sessions , and presley quickly grew more confident on stage .
according to moore , " his movement was a natural thing , but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction .
he'd do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick .
" presley made what would be his only appearance on nashville's " grand ole opry " stage on october *num* ; after a polite audience response , " opry " manager jim denny told phillips that his singer was " not bad " but did not suit the program .
in november *num* , presley performed on " louisiana hayride"—the " opry"s chief , and more adventurous , rival .
the shreveport-based show was broadcast to *num* radio stations in *num* states .
presley had another attack of nerves during the first set , which drew a muted reaction .
a more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response .
house drummer d .
j .
fontana brought a new element , complementing presley's movements with accented beats that he had mastered playing in strip clubs .
soon after the show , the " hayride " engaged presley for a year's worth of saturday-night appearances .
trading in his old guitar for $8 ( and seeing it promptly dispatched to the garbage ) , he purchased a martin instrument for $175 , and his trio began playing in new locales , including houston , texas and texarkana , arkansas .
many fledgling performers , like minnie pearl , johnny horton , and johnny cash , sang the praises of " louisiana hayride " sponsor , the southern maid donut flour company ( texas ) , including elvis presley , who famously developed a lifelong love of doughnuts .
presley made his singular product endorsement commercial for the doughnut company , which was never released , recording a radio jingle , " in exchange for a box of hot glazed doughnuts .
" elvis made his first television appearance on the ksla-tv television broadcast of " louisiana hayride " .
soon after , he failed an audition for " arthur godfrey's talent scouts " on the cbs television network .
by early *num* , presley's regular " hayride " appearances , constant touring , and well-received record releases had made him a regional star , from tennessee to west texas .
in january , neal signed a formal management contract with presley and brought him to the attention of colonel tom parker , whom he considered the best promoter in the music business .
parker—who claimed to be from west virginia ( he was actually dutch ) —had acquired an honorary colonel's commission from country singer turned louisiana governor jimmie davis .
having successfully managed top country star eddy arnold , parker was working with the new number-one country singer , hank snow .
parker booked presley on snow's february tour .
when the tour reached odessa , texas , a 19-year-old roy orbison saw presley for the first time : " his energy was incredible , his instinct was just amazing .
.
.
.
i just didn't know what to make of it .
there was just no reference point in the culture to compare it .
" by august , sun had released ten sides credited to " elvis presley , scotty and bill " ; on the latest recordings , the trio were joined by a drummer .
some of the songs , like " that's all right " , were in what one memphis journalist described as the " r&b idiom of negro field jazz " ; others , like " blue moon of kentucky " , were " more in the country field " , " but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both " .
this blend of styles made it difficult for presley's music to find radio airplay .
according to neal , many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because he sounded too much like a black artist and none of the rhythm-and-blues stations would touch him because " he sounded too much like a hillbilly .
" the blend came to be known as rockabilly .
at the time , presley was variously billed as " the king of western bop " , " the hillbilly cat " , and " the memphis flash " .
presley renewed neal's management contract in august *num* , simultaneously appointing parker as his special adviser .
the group maintained an extensive touring schedule throughout the second half of the year .
neal recalled , " it was almost frightening , the reaction that came to elvis from the teenaged boys .
so many of them , through some sort of jealousy , would practically hate him .
there were occasions in some towns in texas when we'd have to be sure to have a police guard because somebody'd always try to take a crack at him .
they'd get a gang and try to waylay him or something .
" the trio became a quartet when " hayride " drummer fontana joined as a full member .
in mid-october , they played a few shows in support of bill haley , whose " rock around the clock " track had been a number-one hit the previous year .
haley observed that presley had a natural feel for rhythm , and advised him to sing fewer ballads .
at the country disc jockey convention in early november , presley was voted the year's most promising male artist .
several record companies had by now shown interest in signing him .
after three major labels made offers of up to $25 , *num* , parker and phillips struck a deal with rca victor on november *num* to acquire presley's sun contract for an unprecedented $40 , *num* .
presley , at *num* , was still a minor , so his father signed the contract .
parker arranged with the owners of hill & range publishing , jean and julian aberbach , to create two entities , elvis presley music and gladys music , to handle all the new material recorded by presley .
songwriters were obliged to forgo one third of their customary royalties in exchange for having him perform their compositions .
by december , rca had begun to heavily promote its new singer , and before month's end had reissued many of his sun recordings .
on january *num* , *num* , presley made his first recordings for rca in nashville .
extending presley's by-now customary backup of moore , black , fontana , and " hayride " pianist floyd cramer—who had been performing at live club dates with presley—rca enlisted guitarist chet atkins and three background singers , including gordon stoker of the popular jordanaires quartet , to fill out the sound .
the session produced the moody , unusual " heartbreak hotel " , released as a single on january *num* .
parker finally brought presley to national television , booking him on cbs's " stage show " for six appearances over two months .
the program , produced in new york , was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers tommy and jimmy dorsey .
after his first appearance , on january *num* , presley stayed in town to record at rca's new york studio .
the sessions yielded eight songs , including a cover of carl perkins’s rockabilly anthem " blue suede shoes " .
in february , presley's " i forgot to remember to forget " , a sun recording initially released the previous august , reached the top of the " billboard " country chart .
neal's contract was terminated , and , on march *num* , parker became presley's manager .
rca released presley's self-titled debut album on march *num* .
joined by five previously unreleased sun recordings , its seven recently recorded tracks were of a broad variety .
there were two country songs and a bouncy pop tune .
the others would centrally define the evolving sound of rock and roll : " blue suede shoes"—"an improvement over perkins ' in almost every way " , according to critic robert hilburn—and three r&b numbers that had been part of presley's stage repertoire for some time , covers of little richard , ray charles , and the drifters .
as described by hilburn , these " were the most revealing of all .
unlike many white artists .
.
.
who watered down the gritty edges of the original r&b versions of songs in the ' 50s , presley reshaped them .
he not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar , not piano , the lead instrument in all three cases .
" it became the first rock and roll album to top the " billboard " chart , a position it held for *num* weeks .
while presley was not an innovative guitarist like moore or contemporary african-american rockers bo diddley and chuck berry , cultural historian gilbert b .
rodman argued that the album's cover image , " of elvis having the time of his life on stage " with a guitar in his hands " played a crucial role in positioning the guitar .
.
.
as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music .
" on april *num* , presley made the first of two appearances on nbc's " milton berle show " .
his performance , on the deck of the uss " hancock " in san diego , california , prompted cheers and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates .
a few days later , a flight taking presley and his band to nashville for a recording session left all three badly shaken when an engine died and the plane almost went down over arkansas .
twelve weeks after its original release , " heartbreak hotel " became presley's first number one pop hit .
in late april , presley began a two-week residency at the new frontier hotel and casino on the las vegas strip .
the shows were poorly received by the conservative , middle-aged hotel guests—"like a jug of corn liquor at a champagne party " , wrote a critic for " newsweek .
" amid his vegas tenure , presley , who had serious acting ambitions , signed a seven-year contract with paramount pictures .
he began a tour of the midwest in mid-may , taking in *num* cities in as many days .
he had attended several shows by freddie bell and the bellboys in vegas and was struck by their cover of " hound dog " , a hit in *num* for blues singer big mama thornton by songwriters jerry leiber and mike stoller .
it became the new closing number of his act .
after a show in la crosse , wisconsin , an urgent message on the letterhead of the local catholic diocese's newspaper was sent to fbi director j .
edgar hoover .
it warned that " presley is a definite danger to the security of the united states .
.
.
.
[ his ] actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth .
.
.
.
after the show , more than *num* , *num* teenagers tried to gang into presley's room at the auditorium .
.
.
.
indications of the harm presley did just in la crosse were the two high school girls .
.
.
whose abdomen and thigh had presley's autograph .
" the second " milton berle show " appearance came on june *num* at nbc's hollywood studio , amid another hectic tour .
berle persuaded presley to leave his guitar backstage , advising , " let ' em see you , son .
" during the performance , presley abruptly halted an uptempo rendition of " hound dog " with a wave of his arm and launched into a slow , grinding version accentuated with energetic , exaggerated body movements .
presley's gyrations created a storm of controversy .
television critics were outraged : jack gould of " the new york times " wrote , " mr .
presley has no discernible singing ability .
.
.
.
his phrasing , if it can be called that , consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginner's aria in a bathtub .
.
.
.
his one specialty is an accented movement of the body .
.
.
primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway .
" ben gross of the new york " daily news " opined that popular music " has reached its lowest depths in the ' grunt and groin ' antics of one elvis presley .
.
.
.
elvis , who rotates his pelvis .
.
.
gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar , tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos " .
ed sullivan , whose own variety show was the nation's most popular , declared him " unfit for family viewing " .
to presley's displeasure , he soon found himself being referred to as " elvis the pelvis " , which he called " one of the most childish expressions i ever heard , comin ' from an adult .
" the berle shows drew such high ratings that presley was booked for a july *num* appearance on nbc's " steve allen show " in new york .
allen , no fan of rock and roll , introduced a " new elvis " in a white bow tie and black tails .
presley sang " hound dog " for less than a minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bow tie .
as described by television historian jake austen , " allen thought presley was talentless and absurd .
.
.
[ he ] set things up so that presley would show his contrition " .
allen later wrote that he found presley's " strange , gangly , country-boy charisma , his hard-to-define cuteness , and his charming eccentricity intriguing " and simply worked him into the customary " comedy fabric " of his program .
just before the final rehearsal for the show , presley told a reporter , " i'm holding down on this show .
i don't want to do anything to make people dislike me .
i think tv is important so i'm going to go along , but i won't be able to give the kind of show i do in a personal appearance .
" presley would refer back to the allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career .
later that night , he appeared on " hy gardner calling " , a popular local tv show .
pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism to which he was being subjected , presley responded , " no , i haven't , i don't feel like i'm doing anything wrong .
.
.
.
i don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music .
.
.
.
i mean , how would rock ' n ' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents ? " the next day , presley recorded " hound dog " , along with " any way you want me " and " don't be cruel " .
the jordanaires sang harmony , as they had on " the steve allen show " ; they would work with presley through the 1960s .
a few days later , presley made an outdoor concert appearance in memphis , at which he announced , " you know , those people in new york are not gonna change me none .
i'm gonna show you what the real elvis is like tonight .
" in august , a judge in jacksonville , florida , ordered presley to tame his act .
throughout the following performance , he largely kept still , except for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order .
the single pairing " don't be cruel " with " hound dog " ruled the top of the charts for *num* weeks—a mark that would not be surpassed for *num* years .
recording sessions for presley's second album took place in hollywood during the first week of september .
leiber and stoller , the writers of " hound dog " , contributed " love me " .
allen's show with presley had , for the first time , beaten cbs's " ed sullivan show " in the ratings .
sullivan , despite his june pronouncement , booked presley for three appearances for an unprecedented $50 , *num* .
the first , on september *num* , *num* , was seen by approximately *num* million viewers—a record *num* .
*num* percent of the television audience .
actor charles laughton hosted the show , filling in while sullivan was recovering from a car accident .
presley appeared in two segments that night from cbs television city in los angeles .
according to elvis legend , presley was shot only from the waist up .
watching clips of the allen and berle shows with his producer , sullivan had opined that presley " got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pants—so when he moves his legs back and forth you can see the outline of his cock .
.
.
.
i think it's a coke bottle .
.
.
.
we just can't have this on a sunday night .
this is a family show ! " sullivan publicly told " tv guide " , " as for his gyrations , the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots .
" in fact , presley was shown head-to-toe in the first and second shows .
though the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut , with leg-concealing closeups when he danced , the studio audience reacted in customary style : screaming .
presley's performance of his forthcoming single , the ballad " love me tender " , prompted a record-shattering million advance orders .
more than any other single event , it was this first appearance on " the ed sullivan show " that made presley a national celebrity of barely precedented proportions .
accompanying presley's rise to fame , a cultural shift was taking place that he both helped inspire and came to symbolize .
igniting the " biggest pop craze since glenn miller and frank sinatra .
.
.
presley brought rock'n'roll into the mainstream of popular culture " , writes historian marty jezer .
" as presley set the artistic pace , other artists followed .
.
.
.
presley , more than anyone else , gave the young a belief in themselves as a distinct and somehow unified generation—the first in america ever to feel the power of an integrated youth culture .
" the audience response at presley's live shows became increasingly fevered .
moore recalled , " he'd start out , ' you ain't nothin ' but a hound dog , ' and they'd just go to pieces .
they'd always react the same way .
there'd be a riot every time .
" at the two concerts he performed in september at the mississippi–alabama fair and dairy show , *num* national guardsmen were added to the police security to ensure that the crowd would not cause a ruckus .
" elvis " , presley's second album , was released in october and quickly rose to number one on the billboard .
the album includes " old shep " , which he sang at the talent show in *num* , and which now marked the first time he played piano on an rca session .
according to guralnick , one can hear " in the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm both the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique .
" assessing the musical and cultural impact of presley's recordings from " that's all right " through " elvis " , rock critic dave marsh wrote that " these records , more than any others , contain the seeds of what rock & roll was , has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become .
" presley returned to the sullivan show at its main studio in new york , hosted this time by its namesake , on october *num* .
after the performance , crowds in nashville and st .
louis burned him in effigy .
his first motion picture , " love me tender " , was released on november *num* .
though he was not top billed , the film's original title—"the reno brothers"—was changed to capitalize on his latest number one record : " love me tender " had hit the top of the charts earlier that month .
to further take advantage of presley's popularity , four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role .
the film was panned by the critics but did very well at the box office .
presley would receive top billing on every subsequent film he made .
on december *num* , presley dropped into sun records where carl perkins and jerry lee lewis were recording and had an impromptu jam session , along with johnny cash .
though phillips no longer had the right to release any presley material , he made sure that the session was captured on tape .
the results , none officially released for *num* years , became known as the " million dollar quartet " recordings .
the year ended with a front-page story in " the wall street journal " reporting that presley merchandise had brought in $22 million on top of his record sales , and " billboard"s declaration that he had placed more songs in the top *num* than any other artist since records were first charted .
in his first full year at rca , one of the music industry's largest companies , presley had accounted for over *num* percent of the label's singles sales .
presley made his third and final " ed sullivan show " appearance on january *num* , 1957—on this occasion indeed shot only down to the waist .
some commentators have claimed that parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to generate publicity .
in any event , as critic greil marcus describes , presley " did not tie himself down .
leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows , he stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha , if not a harem girl .
from the make-up over his eyes , the hair falling in his face , the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth , he was playing rudolph valentino in " the sheik " , with all stops out .
" to close , displaying his range and defying sullivan's wishes , presley sang a gentle black spiritual , " peace in the valley " .
at the end of the show , sullivan declared presley " a real decent , fine boy " .
two days later , the memphis draft board announced that presley would be classified 1-a and would probably be drafted sometime that year .
each of the three presley singles released in the first half of *num* went to number one : " too much " , " all shook up " , and " ( let me be your ) teddy bear " .
already an international star , he was attracting fans even where his music was not officially released .
under the headline " presley records a craze in soviet " , " the new york times " reported that pressings of his music on discarded x-ray plates were commanding high prices in leningrad .
between film shoots and recording sessions , presley also found time to purchase an 18-room mansion eight miles ( *num* km ) south of downtown memphis for himself and his parents : graceland .
" loving you"—the soundtrack to his second film , released in july—was presley's third straight number one album .
the title track was written by leiber and stoller , who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for " jailhouse rock " , presley's next film .
the songwriting team effectively produced the " jailhouse " sessions and developed a close working relationship with presley , who came to regard them as his " good-luck charm " .
" he was fast , " said leiber .
" any demo you gave him he knew by heart in ten minutes .
" the title track was yet another number one hit , as was the " jailhouse rock " ep .
presley undertook three brief tours during the year , continuing to generate a crazed audience response .
a detroit newspaper suggested that " the trouble with going to see elvis presley is that you're liable to get killed .
" villanova students pelted him with eggs in philadelphia , and in vancouver the crowd rioted after the end of the show , destroying the stage .
frank sinatra , who had famously inspired the swooning of teenage girls in the 1940s , condemned the new musical phenomenon .
in a magazine article , he decried rock and roll as " brutal , ugly , degenerate , vicious .
.
.
.
it fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people .
it smells phoney and false .
it is sung , played and written , for the most part , by cretinous goons .
.
.
.
this rancid-smelling aphrodisiac i deplore .
" asked for a response , presley said , " i admire the man .
he has a right to say what he wants to say .
he is a great success and a fine actor , but i think he shouldn't have said it .
.
.
.
this is a trend , just the same as he faced when he started years ago .
" leiber and stoller were again in the studio for the recording of " elvis ' christmas album " .
toward the end of the session , they wrote a song on the spot at presley's request : " santa claus is back in town " , an innuendo-laden blues .
the holiday release stretched presley's string of number one albums to four and would become the best-selling christmas album ever in the united states , with eventual sales of over *num* million worldwide .
after the session , moore and black—drawing only modest weekly salaries , sharing in none of presley's massive financial success—resigned .
though they were brought back on a per diem basis a few weeks later , it was clear that they had not been part of presley's inner circle for some time .
on december *num* , presley received his draft notice .
he was granted a deferment to finish the forthcoming " king creole " , in which $350 , *num* had already been invested by paramount and producer hal wallis .
a couple of weeks into the new year , " don't " , another leiber and stoller tune , became presley's tenth number one seller .
it had been only *num* months since " heartbreak hotel " had brought him to the top for the first time .
recording sessions for the " king creole " soundtrack were held in hollywood in mid-january *num* .
leiber and stoller provided three songs and were again on hand , but it would be the last time they and presley worked closely together .
as stoller recalled , presley's manager and entourage sought to wall him off : " he was removed .
.
.
.
they kept him separate .
" a brief soundtrack session on february *num* marked another ending—it was the final occasion on which black was to perform with presley .
he died in *num* .
on march *num* , *num* , presley was drafted into the u .
s .
army as a private at fort chaffee , near fort smith , arkansas .
his arrival was a major media event .
hundreds of people descended on presley as he stepped from the bus ; photographers then accompanied him into the fort .
presley announced that he was looking forward to his military stint , saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else : " the army can do anything it wants with me .
" presley commenced basic training at fort hood , texas .
during a two-week leave in early june , he recorded five songs in nashville .
in early august , his mother was diagnosed with hepatitis , and her condition rapidly worsened .
presley , granted emergency leave to visit her , arrived in memphis on august *num* .
two days later , she died of heart failure , aged *num* .
presley was devastated ; their relationship had remained extremely close—even into his adulthood , they would use baby talk with each other and presley would address her with pet names .
after training , presley joined the *ord* armored division in friedberg , germany , on october *num* .
while on maneuvers , presley was introduced to amphetamines by a sergeant .
he became " practically evangelical about their benefits " , not only for energy but for " strength " and weight loss as well , and many of his friends in the outfit joined him in indulging .
the army also introduced presley to karate , which he studied seriously , training with jürgen seydel .
it became a lifelong interest , which he later included in his live performances .
fellow soldiers have attested to presley's wish to be seen as an able , ordinary soldier , despite his fame , and to his generosity .
he donated his army pay to charity , purchased tv sets for the base , and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit .
while in friedberg , presley met 14-year-old priscilla beaulieu .
they would eventually marry after a seven-and-a-half-year courtship .
in her autobiography , priscilla said that presley was concerned that his *ord* spell as a g .
i .
would ruin his career .
in special services , he would have been able to give musical performances and remain in touch with the public , but parker had convinced him that to gain popular respect , he should serve his country as a regular soldier .
media reports echoed presley's concerns about his career , but rca producer steve sholes and freddy bienstock of hill and range had carefully prepared for his two-year hiatus .
armed with a substantial amount of unreleased material , they kept up a regular stream of successful releases .
between his induction and discharge , presley had ten top *num* hits , including " wear my ring around your neck " , the best-selling " hard headed woman " , and " one night " in *num* , and " ( now and then there's ) a fool such as i " and the number one " a big hunk o ' love " in *num* .
rca also generated four albums compiling old material during this period , most successfully " elvis ' golden records " ( *num* ) , which hit number three on the lp chart .
presley returned to the united states on march *num* , *num* , and was honorably discharged three days later with the rank of sergeant .
the train that carried him from new jersey to tennessee was mobbed all the way , and presley was called upon to appear at scheduled stops to please his fans .
on the night of march *num* , he entered rca's nashville studio to cut tracks for a new album along with a single , " stuck on you " , which was rushed into release and swiftly became a number one hit .
another nashville session two weeks later yielded a pair of his best-selling singles , the ballads " it's now or never " and " are you lonesome tonight ? " , along with the rest of " elvis is back ! " the album features several songs described by greil marcus as full of chicago blues " menace , driven by presley's own super-miked acoustic guitar , brilliant playing by scotty moore , and demonic sax work from boots randolph .
elvis's singing wasn't sexy , it was pornographic .
" as a whole , the record " conjured up the vision of a performer who could be all things " , in the words of music historian john robertson : " a flirtatious teenage idol with a heart of gold ; a tempestuous , dangerous lover ; a gutbucket blues singer ; a sophisticated nightclub entertainer ; [ a ] raucous rocker " .
released only days after recording was complete , it reached number two on the album chart .
presley returned to television on may *num* as a guest on " "—ironic for both stars , given sinatra's not-so-distant excoriation of rock and roll .
also known as " welcome home elvis " , the show had been taped in late march , the only time all year presley performed in front of an audience .
parker secured an unheard-of $125 , *num* fee for eight minutes of singing .
the broadcast drew an enormous viewership .
"g .
i .
blues " , the soundtrack to presley's first film since his return , was a number one album in october .
his first lp of sacred material , " his hand in mine " , followed two months later .
it reached number *num* on the u .
s .
pop chart and number *num* in the u .
k .
, remarkable figures for a gospel album .
in february *num* , presley performed two shows for a benefit event in memphis , on behalf of *num* local charities .
during a luncheon preceding the event , rca presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over *num* million records .
a 12-hour nashville session in mid-march yielded nearly all of presley's next studio album , " something for everybody " .
as described by john robertson , it exemplifies the nashville sound , the restrained , cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s .
presaging much of what was to come from presley himself over the next half-decade , the album is largely " a pleasant , unthreatening pastiche of the music that had once been elvis's birthright " .
it would be his sixth number one lp .
another benefit concert , raising money for a pearl harbor memorial , was staged on march *num* , in hawaii .
it was to be presley's last public performance for seven years .
parker had by now pushed presley into a heavy film making schedule , focused on formulaic , modestly budgeted musical comedies .
presley , at first , insisted on pursuing higher roles , but when two films in a more dramatic vein—"flaming star " ( *num* ) and " wild in the country " ( *num* ) —were less commercially successful , he reverted to the formula .
among the *num* films he made during the 1960s , there were a few further exceptions .
his films were almost universally panned ; critic andrew caine dismissed them as a " pantheon of bad taste " .
nonetheless , they were virtually all profitable .
hal wallis , who produced nine of them , declared , " a presley picture is the only sure thing in hollywood .
" of presley's films in the 1960s , *num* were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another *num* by soundtrack eps .
the films ' rapid production and release schedules—he frequently starred in three a year—affected his music .
according to jerry leiber , the soundtrack formula was already evident before presley left for the army : " three ballads , one medium-tempo [ number ] , one up-tempo , and one break blues boogie " .
as the decade wore on , the quality of the soundtrack songs grew " progressively worse " .
julie parrish , who appeared in " paradise , hawaiian style " ( *num* ) , says that he disliked many of the songs chosen for his films .
the jordanaires ' gordon stoker describes how presley would retreat from the studio microphone : " the material was so bad that he felt like he couldn't sing it .
" most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of doc pomus and mort shuman .
but by and large , according to biographer jerry hopkins , the numbers seemed to be " written on order by men who never really understood elvis or rock and roll " .
regardless of the songs ' quality , it has been argued that presley generally sang them well , with commitment .
critic dave marsh heard the opposite : " presley isn't trying , probably the wisest course in the face of material like ' no room to rumba in a sports car ' and ' rock-a-hula baby ' .
" in the first half of the decade , three of presley's soundtrack albums were ranked number one on the pop charts , and a few of his most popular songs came from his films , such as " can't help falling in love " ( *num* ) and " return to sender " ( *num* ) .
( " viva las vegas " , the title track to the *num* film , was a minor hit as a b-side , and became truly popular only later .
) but , as with artistic merit , the commercial returns steadily diminished .
during a five-year span—1964 through 1968—presley had only one top-ten hit : " crying in the chapel " ( *num* ) , a gospel number recorded back in *num* .
as for non-film albums , between the june *num* release of " pot luck " and the november *num* release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback , only one lp of new material by presley was issued : the gospel album " how great thou art " ( *num* ) .
it won him his first grammy award , for best sacred performance .
as marsh described , presley was " arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time [ and ] really the last rock & roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs " .
shortly before christmas *num* , more than seven years since they first met , presley proposed to priscilla beaulieu .
they were married on may *num* , *num* , in a brief ceremony in their suite at the aladdin hotel in las vegas .
the flow of formulaic films and assembly-line soundtracks rolled on .
it was not until october *num* , when the " clambake " soundtrack lp registered record low sales for a new presley album , that rca executives recognized a problem .
" by then , of course , the damage had been done " , as historians connie kirchberg and marc hendrickx put it .
" elvis was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a has-been to all but his most loyal fans .
" presley's only child , lisa marie , was born on february *num* , *num* , during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career .
of the eight presley singles released between january *num* and may *num* , only two charted in the top *num* , and none higher than number *num* .
his forthcoming soundtrack album , " speedway " , would rank at number *num* on the " billboard " chart .
parker had already shifted his plans to television , where presley had not appeared since the sinatra timex show in *num* .
he maneuvered a deal with nbc that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a christmas special .
recorded in late june in burbank , california , the special , simply called " elvis " , aired on december *num* , *num* .
later known as the ' *num* comeback special , the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—presley's first live performances since *num* .
the live segments saw presley dressed in tight black leather , singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days .
director and co-producer steve binder had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of christmas songs parker had originally planned .
the show , nbc's highest rated that season , captured *num* percent of the total viewing audience .
jon landau of " eye " magazine remarked , " there is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home .
he sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock ' n ' roll singers .
he moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made jim morrison green with envy .
" dave marsh calls the performance one of " emotional grandeur and historical resonance " .
by january *num* , the single " if i can dream " , written for the special , reached number *num* .
the soundtrack album rose into the top ten .
according to friend jerry schilling , the special reminded presley of what " he had not been able to do for years , being able to choose the people ; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack .
.
.
.
he was out of prison , man .
" binder said of presley's reaction , " i played elvis the 60-minute show , and he told me in the screening room , ' steve , it's the greatest thing i've ever done in my life .
i give you my word i will never sing a song i don't believe in .
buoyed by the experience of the comeback special , presley engaged in a prolific series of recording sessions at american sound studio , which led to the acclaimed " from elvis in memphis " .
released in june *num* , it was his first secular , non-soundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years .
as described by dave marsh , it is " a masterpiece in which presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years .
he sings country songs , soul songs and rockers with real conviction , a stunning achievement .
" the album featured the hit single " in the ghetto " , issued in april , which reached number three on the pop chart—presley's first non-gospel top ten hit since " bossa nova baby " in *num* .
further hit singles were culled from the american sound sessions : " suspicious minds " , " don't cry daddy " , and " kentucky rain " .
presley was keen to resume regular live performing .
following the success of the comeback special , offers came in from around the world .
the london palladium offered parker $28 , *num* for a one-week engagement .
he responded , " that's fine for me , now how much can you get for elvis ? " in may , the brand new international hotel in las vegas , boasting the largest showroom in the city , announced that it had booked presley .
he was scheduled to perform *num* shows over four weeks beginning july *num* .
moore , fontana , and the jordanaires declined to participate , afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in nashville .
presley assembled new , top-notch accompaniment , led by guitarist james burton and including two gospel groups , the imperials and sweet inspirations .
costume designer bill belew , responsible for the intense leather styling of the comeback special , created a new stage look for presley , inspired by presley's passion for karate .
nonetheless , he was nervous : his only previous las vegas engagement , in *num* , had been dismal .
parker , who intended to make presley's return the show business event of the year , oversaw a major promotional push .
for his part , hotel owner kirk kerkorian arranged to send his own plane to new york to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance .
presley took to the stage without introduction .
the audience of *num* , *num* , including many celebrities , gave him a standing ovation before he sang a note and another after his performance .
a third followed his encore , " can't help falling in love " ( a song that would be his closing number for much of the 1970s ) .
at a press conference after the show , when a journalist referred to him as " the king " , presley gestured toward fats domino , who was taking in the scene .
" no , " presley said , " that's the real king of rock and roll .
" the next day , parker's negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for presley to play each february and august , at an annual salary of $1 million .
" newsweek " commented , " there are several unbelievable things about elvis , but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars .
" " rolling stone " called presley " supernatural , his own resurrection .
" in november , presley's final non-concert film , " change of habit " , opened .
the double album " from memphis to vegas / from vegas to memphis " came out the same month ; the first lp consisted of live performances from the international , the second of more cuts from the american sound sessions .
" suspicious minds " reached the top of the charts—presley's first u .
s .
pop number one in over seven years , and his last .
cassandra peterson , later television's elvira , met presley during this period in las vegas , where she was working as a showgirl .
she recalled of their encounter , " he was so anti-drug when i met him .
i mentioned to him that i smoked marijuana , and he was just appalled .
he said , ' don't ever do that again .
presley was not only deeply opposed to recreational drugs , he also rarely drank .
several of his family members had been alcoholics , a fate he intended to avoid .
presley returned to the international early in *num* for the first of the year's two month-long engagements , performing two shows a night .
recordings from these shows were issued on the album " on stage " .
in late february , presley performed six attendance-record–breaking shows at the houston astrodome .
in april , the single " the wonder of you " was issued—a number one hit in the u .
k .
, it topped the u .
s .
adult contemporary chart , as well .
mgm filmed rehearsal and concert footage at the international during august for the documentary " " .
presley was performing in a jumpsuit , which would become a trademark of his live act .
during this engagement , he was threatened with murder unless $50 , *num* was paid .
presley had been the target of many threats since the 1950s , often without his knowledge .
the fbi took the threat seriously and security was stepped up for the next two shows .
presley went onstage with a derringer in his right boot and a .
*num* pistol in his waistband , but the concerts succeeded without any incidents .
the album , " that's the way it is " , produced to accompany the documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings , marked a stylistic shift .
as music historian john robertson noted , " the authority of presley's singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the american-roots inspiration of the memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound .
with country put on the back burner , and soul and r&b left in memphis , what was left was very classy , very clean white pop—perfect for the las vegas crowd , but a definite retrograde step for elvis .
" after the end of his international engagement on september *num* , presley embarked on a week-long concert tour , largely of the south , his first since *num* .
another week-long tour , of the west coast , followed in november .
on december *num* , *num* , presley engineered a meeting with president richard nixon at the white house , where he expressed his patriotism and explained how he believed he could reach out to the hippies to help combat the drug culture he and the president abhorred .
he asked nixon for a bureau of narcotics and dangerous drugs badge , to add to similar items he had begun collecting and to signify official sanction of his patriotic efforts .
nixon , who apparently found the encounter awkward , expressed a belief that presley could send a positive message to young people and that it was therefore important that he " retain his credibility " .
presley told nixon that the beatles , whose songs he regularly performed in concert during the era , exemplified what he saw as a trend of anti-americanism .
presley and his friends previously had a four-hour get-together with the beatles at his home in bel air , california in august *num* .
on hearing reports of the meeting , paul mccartney later said that he " felt a bit betrayed .
.
.
.
the great joke was that we were taking [ illegal ] drugs , and look what happened to him " , a reference to presley's early death , linked to prescription drug abuse .
the u .
s .
junior chamber of commerce named presley one of its annual ten most outstanding young men of the nation on january *num* , *num* .
not long after , the city of memphis named the stretch of highway *num* south on which graceland is located " elvis presley boulevard " .
the same year , presley became the first rock and roll singer to be awarded the lifetime achievement award ( then known as the bing crosby award ) by the national academy of recording arts and sciences , the grammy award organization .
three new , non-film presley studio albums were released in *num* , as many as had come out over the previous eight years .
best received by critics was " elvis country " , a concept record that focused on genre standards .
the biggest seller was " elvis sings the wonderful world of christmas " , " the truest statement of all " , according to greil marcus .
" in the midst of ten painfully genteel christmas songs , every one sung with appalling sincerity and humility , one could find elvis tom-catting his way through six blazing minutes of ' merry christmas baby , ' a raunchy old charles brown blues .
.
.
.
if [ presley's ] sin was his lifelessness , it was his sinfulness that brought him to life " .
mgm again filmed presley in april *num* , this time for " elvis on tour " , which went on to win the golden globe award for best documentary film that year .
his gospel album " he touched me " , released that month , would earn him his second competitive grammy award , for best inspirational performance .
a 14-date tour commenced with an unprecedented four consecutive sold-out shows at new york's madison square garden .
the evening concert on july *num* was recorded and issued in an lp form a week later .
" " became one of presley's biggest-selling albums .
after the tour , the single " burning love " was released—presley's last top ten hit on the u .
s .
pop chart .
" the most exciting single elvis has made since ' all shook up' " , wrote rock critic robert christgau .
" who else could make ' it's coming closer , the flames are now licking my body ' sound like an assignation with james brown's backup band ? " presley and his wife , meanwhile , had become increasingly distant , barely cohabiting .
in *num* , an affair he had with joyce bova resulted—unbeknownst to him—in her pregnancy and an abortion .
he often raised the possibility of her moving into graceland , saying that he was likely to leave priscilla .
the presleys separated on february *num* , *num* , after priscilla disclosed her relationship with mike stone , a karate instructor presley had recommended to her .
priscilla related that when she told him , presley " grabbed .
.
.
and forcefully made love to " her , declaring , " this is how a real man makes love to his woman .
" she later stated in an interview that she regretted her choice of words in describing the incident , and said it had been an overstatement .
five months later , presley's new girlfriend , linda thompson , a songwriter and one-time memphis beauty queen , moved in with him .
presley and his wife filed for divorce on august *num* .
according to joe moscheo of the imperials , the failure of presley's marriage " was a blow from which he never recovered .
" at a rare press conference that june , a reporter had asked presley whether he was satisfied with his image .
presley replied , " well , the image is one thing and the human being another .
.
.
it's very hard to live up to an image .
" in january *num* , presley performed two benefit concerts for the kui lee cancer fund in connection with a groundbreaking tv special , " aloha from hawaii " , which would be the first concert by a solo artist to be aired globally .
the first show served as a practice run and backup should technical problems affect the live broadcast two days later .
on january *num* , " aloha from hawaii " aired live via satellite to prime-time audiences in japan , south korea , thailand , the philippines , australia , and new zealand , as well as to u .
s .
servicemen based across southeast asia .
in japan , where it capped a nationwide elvis presley week , it smashed viewing records .
the next night , it was simulcast to *num* european countries , and in april an extended version finally aired in the u .
s .
, where it won a *num* percent share of the tv audience .
over time , parker's claim that it was seen by one billion or more people would be broadly accepted , but that figure appeared to have been sheer invention .
presley's stage costume became the most recognized example of the elaborate concert garb with which his latter-day persona became closely associated .
as described by bobbie ann mason , " at the end of the show , when he spreads out his american eagle cape , with the full stretched wings of the eagle studded on the back , he becomes a god figure .
" the accompanying double album , released in february , went to number one and eventually sold over *num* million copies in the united states .
it proved to be presley's last u .
s .
number one pop album during his lifetime .
at a midnight show the same month , four men rushed onto the stage in an apparent attack .
security men came to presley's defense , and he ejected one invader from the stage himself .
following the show , he became obsessed with the idea that the men had been sent by mike stone to kill him .
though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans , he raged , " there's too much pain in me .
.
.
stone [ must ] die .
" his outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him , despite administering large doses of medication .
after another two full days of raging , red west , his friend and bodyguard , felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and was relieved when presley decided , " aw hell , let's just leave it for now .
maybe it's a bit heavy .
" presley's divorce was finalized on october *num* , *num* .
by then , his health was in serious decline .
twice during the year , he overdosed on barbiturates , spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first incident .
towards the end of *num* , he was hospitalized , semi-comatose from the effects of pethidine addiction .
according to his primary care physician , dr .
george c .
nichopoulos , presley " felt that by getting [ drugs ] from a doctor , he wasn't the common everyday junkie getting something off the street " .
since his comeback , he had staged more live shows with each passing year , and *num* saw *num* concerts , his busiest schedule ever .
despite his failing health , in *num* , he undertook another intensive touring schedule .
presley's condition declined precipitously in september .
keyboardist tony brown remembered presley's arrival at a university of maryland concert : " he fell out of the limousine , to his knees .
people jumped to help , and he pushed them away like , ' don't help me .
' he walked on stage and held onto the mike for the first thirty minutes like it was a post .
everybody's looking at each other like , is the tour gonna happen ? " guitarist john wilkinson recalled , " he was all gut .
he was slurring .
he was so fucked up .
.
.
.
it was obvious he was drugged .
it was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body .
it was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible .
.
.
.
i remember crying .
he could barely get through the introductions .
" wilkinson recounted that a few nights later in detroit , " i watched him in his dressing room , just draped over a chair , unable to move .
so often i thought , ' boss , why don't you just cancel this tour and take a year off .
.
.
? ' i mentioned something once in a guarded moment .
he patted me on the back and said , ' it'll be all right .
don't you worry about it .
presley continued to play to sellout crowds .
as cultural critic marjorie garber describes , he was now widely seen as a garish pop crooner : " in effect he had become liberace .
even his fans were now middle-aged matrons and blue-haired grandmothers .
" on july *num* , *num* , vernon presley—who had become deeply involved in his son's financial affairs—fired " memphis mafia " bodyguards red west ( presley's friend since the 1950s ) , sonny west , and david hebler , citing the need to " cut back on expenses " .
presley was in palm springs at the time , and some suggested that he was too cowardly to face the three himself .
another associate of presley's , john o'grady , argued that the bodyguards were dropped because their rough treatment of fans had prompted too many lawsuits .
however , presley's stepbrother , david stanley , claimed that the bodyguards were fired because they were becoming more outspoken about presley's drug dependency .
rca , which had enjoyed a steady stream of product from presley for over a decade , grew anxious as his interest in spending time in the studio waned .
after a december *num* session that produced *num* songs , enough for almost two albums , he did not enter the studio in *num* .
parker sold rca on another concert record , " elvis recorded live on stage in memphis " .
recorded on march *num* , it included a version of " how great thou art " that would win presley his third and final competitive grammy award .
( all three of his competitive grammy wins—out of *num* total nominations—were for gospel recordings .
) presley returned to the studio in hollywood in march *num* , but parker's attempts to arrange another session toward the end of the year were unsuccessful .
in *num* , rca sent a mobile studio to graceland that made possible two full-scale recording sessions at presley's home .
even in that comfortable context , the recording process became a struggle for him .
for all the concerns of his label and manager , in studio sessions between july *num* and october *num* , presley recorded virtually the entire contents of six albums .
though he was no longer a major presence on the pop charts , five of those albums entered the top five of the country chart , and three went to number one : " promised land " ( *num* ) , " from elvis presley boulevard , memphis , tennessee " ( *num* ) , and " moody blue " ( *num* ) .
the story was similar with his singles—there were no major pop hits , but presley was a significant force in not just the country market , but on adult contemporary radio as well .
eight studio singles from this period released during his lifetime were top ten hits on one or both charts , four in *num* alone .
" my boy " was a number one adult contemporary hit in *num* , and " moody blue " topped the country chart and reached the second spot on the adult contemporary chart in *num* .
perhaps his most critically acclaimed recording of the era came that year , with what greil marcus described as his " apocalyptic attack " on the soul classic " hurt " .
" if he felt the way he sounded " , dave marsh wrote of presley's performance , " the wonder isn't that he had only a year left to live but that he managed to survive that long .
" presley and linda thompson split in november *num* , and he took up with a new girlfriend , ginger alden .
he proposed to alden and gave her an engagement ring two months later , though several of his friends later claimed that he had no serious intention of marrying again .
journalist tony scherman wrote that by early *num* , " presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek , energetic former self .
hugely overweight , his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested , he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts .
" in alexandria , louisiana , he was on stage for less than an hour , and " was impossible to understand " .
on march *num* , presley failed to perform in baton rouge , unable to get out of his hotel bed ; a total of four shows had to be canceled and rescheduled .
despite the accelerating deterioration of his health , he stuck to most touring commitments .
according to guralnick , fans " were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment , but it all seemed to go right past presley , whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his spiritualism books .
" a cousin , billy smith , recalled how presley would sit in his room and chat for hours , sometimes recounting favorite monty python sketches and his own past escapades , but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions that reminded smith of howard hughes .
"way down " , presley's last single issued during his career , was released on june *num* .
that month , cbs filmed two concerts for a tv special , " elvis in concert " , to be aired in october .
in the first , shot in omaha on june *num* , presley's voice , guralnick writes , " is almost unrecognizable , a small , childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs , casts about uncertainly for the melody in others , and is virtually unable to articulate or project " .
two days later , in rapid city , south dakota , " he looked healthier , seemed to have lost a little weight , and sounded better , too " , though by the conclusion of the performance , his face was " framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale , swollen cheeks " .
his final concert was held in indianapolis at market square arena , on june *num* .
the book " " , co-written by the three bodyguards fired the previous year , was published on august *num* .
it was the first exposé to detail presley's years of drug misuse .
he was devastated by the book and tried unsuccessfully to halt its release by offering money to the publishers .
by this point , he suffered from multiple ailments : glaucoma , high blood pressure , liver damage , and an enlarged colon , each magnified—and possibly caused—by drug abuse .
on the evening of tuesday , august *num* , *num* , presley was scheduled to fly out of memphis to begin another tour .
that afternoon , ginger alden discovered him in an unresponsive state on a bathroom floor .
according to her eyewitness account , " elvis looked as if his entire body had completely frozen in a seated position while using the commode and then had fallen forward , in that fixed position , directly in front of it .
[ .
.
.
] it was clear that , from the time whatever hit him to the moment he had landed on the floor , elvis hadn't moved .
" attempts to revive him failed , and his death was officially pronounced at *num* : *num* p .
m .
at the baptist memorial hospital .
president jimmy carter issued a statement that credited presley with having " permanently changed the face of american popular culture " .
thousands of people gathered outside graceland to view the open casket .
one of presley's cousins , billy mann , accepted $18 , *num* to secretly photograph the corpse ; the picture appeared on the cover of the " national enquirer"s biggest-selling issue ever .
alden struck a $105 , *num* deal with the " enquirer " for her story , but settled for less when she broke her exclusivity agreement .
presley left her nothing in his will .
presley's funeral was held at graceland on thursday , august *num* .
outside the gates , a car plowed into a group of fans , killing two women and critically injuring a third .
about *num* , *num* people lined the processional route to forest hill cemetery , where presley was buried next to his mother .
within a few weeks , " way down " topped the country and u .
k .
pop charts .
following an attempt to steal presley's body in late august , the remains of both presley and his mother were reburied in graceland's meditation garden on october *num* .
while an autopsy , undertaken the same day presley died , was still in progress , memphis medical examiner dr .
jerry francisco announced that the immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest .
asked if drugs were involved , he declared that " drugs played no role in presley's death " .
in fact , " drug use was heavily implicated " in presley's death , writes guralnick .
the pathologists conducting the autopsy thought it possible , for instance , that he had suffered " anaphylactic shock brought on by the codeine pills he had gotten from his dentist , to which he was known to have had a mild allergy " .
a pair of lab reports filed two months later strongly suggested that polypharmacy was the primary cause of death ; one reported " fourteen drugs in elvis ' system , ten in significant quantity " .
in *num* , forensic pathologist cyril wecht conducted a review of the reports and concluded that a combination of central nervous system depressants had resulted in presley's accidental death .
forensic historian and pathologist michael baden viewed the situation as complicated : " elvis had had an enlarged heart for a long time .
that , together with his drug habit , caused his death .
but he was difficult to diagnose ; it was a judgment call .
" the competence and ethics of two of the centrally involved medical professionals were seriously questioned .
dr .
francisco had offered a cause of death before the autopsy was complete ; claimed the underlying ailment was cardiac arrhythmia , a condition that can be determined only in someone who is still alive ; and denied drugs played any part in presley's death before the toxicology results were known .
allegations of a cover-up were widespread .
while a *num* trial of presley's main physician , dr .
george nichopoulos , exonerated him of criminal liability for his death , the facts were startling : " in the first eight months of *num* alone , he had [ prescribed ] more than *num* , *num* doses of sedatives , amphetamines , and narcotics : all in elvis's name .
" his license was suspended for three months .
it was permanently revoked in the 1990s after the tennessee medical board brought new charges of over-prescription .
in *num* , the presley autopsy report was reopened .
dr .
joseph davis , who had conducted thousands of autopsies as miami-dade county coroner , declared at its completion , " there is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs .
in fact , everything points to a sudden , violent heart attack .
" more recent research has revealed that dr .
francisco did not speak for the entire pathology team .
other staff " could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories , if then .
that would be a matter of weeks .
" one of the examiners , dr .
e .
eric muirhead " could not believe his ears .
francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospital's team of pathologists , he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached .
.
.
.
early on , a meticulous dissection of the body .
.
.
confirmed [ that ] elvis was chronically ill with diabetes , glaucoma , and constipation .
as they proceeded , the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs .
they had also studied his hospital records , which included two admissions for drug detoxification and methadone treatments .
" writer frank coffey thought elvis ' death was due to " a phenomenon called the valsalva maneuver ( essentially straining on the toilet leading to heart stoppage—plausible because elvis suffered constipation , a common reaction to drug use ) " .
in similar terms , dr .
dan warlick , who was present at the autopsy , " believes presley's chronic constipation—the result of years of prescription drug abuse and high-fat , high-cholesterol gorging—brought on what's known as valsalva's maneuver .
put simply , the strain of attempting to defecate compressed the singer's abdominal aorta , shutting down his heart .
" however , in *num* , dr .
forest tennant , who had testified as a defense witness in nichopoulos ' trial , described his own analysis of presley's available medical records .
he concluded that presley's " drug abuse had led to falls , head trauma , and overdoses that damaged his brain " , and that his death was due in part to a toxic reaction to codeine—exacerbated by an undetected liver enzyme defect—which can cause sudden cardiac arrhythmia .
dna analysis in *num* of a hair sample purported to be presley's found evidence of genetic variants that can lead to glaucoma , migraines , and obesity ; a crucial variant associated with the heart-muscle disease hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was also identified .
between *num* and *num* , six of presley's posthumously released singles were top ten country hits .
graceland was opened to the public in *num* .
attracting over half a million visitors annually , it is the second most-visited home in the united states , after the white house .
it was declared a national historic landmark in *num* .
presley has been inducted into five music halls of fame : the rock and roll hall of fame ( *num* ) , the country music hall of fame ( *num* ) , the gospel music hall of fame ( *num* ) , the rockabilly hall of fame ( *num* ) , and the memphis music hall of fame ( *num* ) .
in *num* , he received the w .
c .
handy award from the blues foundation and the academy of country music's first golden hat award .
in *num* , he received the american music awards ' award of merit .
a junkie xl remix of presley's " a little less conversation " ( credited as " elvis vs jxl " ) was used in a nike advertising campaign during the *num* fifa world cup .
it topped the charts in over *num* countries , and was included in a compilation of presley's number one hits , " elv1s " , that was also an international success .
the album returned presley to the " billboard " summit for the first time in almost three decades .
in *num* , a remix of " rubberneckin' " , a *num* recording of presley's , topped the u .
s .
sales chart , as did a 50th-anniversary re-release of " that's all right " the following year .
the latter was an outright hit in britain , debuting at number three on the pop chart ; it also made the top ten in canada .
in *num* , another three reissued singles , " jailhouse rock " , " one night" / "i got stung " , and " it's now or never " , went to number one in the united kingdom .
they were part of a campaign that saw the re-release of all *num* of presley's previous chart-topping u .
k .
singles .
the first , " all shook up " , came with a collectors ' box that made it ineligible to chart again ; each of the other *num* reissues hit the british top five .
in *num* , " forbes " named presley the top-earning deceased celebrity for the fifth straight year , with a gross income of $45 million .
he placed second in *num* , returned to the top spot the next two years , and ranked fourth in *num* .
the following year , he was ranked second , with his highest annual income ever—$60 million—spurred by the celebration of his *ord* birthday and the launch of cirque du soleil's " viva elvis " show in las vegas .
in november *num* , " viva elvis : the album " was released , setting his voice to newly recorded instrumental tracks .
as of mid-2011 , there were an estimated *num* , *num* licensed presley products , and he was again the second-highest-earning deceased celebrity .
six years later , he ranked fourth with earnings of $35 million , up $8 million from *num* due in part to the opening of a new entertainment complex , elvis presley's memphis , and hotel , the guest house at graceland .
for much of his adult life , presley , with his rise from poverty to riches and massive fame , had seemed to epitomize the american dream .
in his final years and even more so after his death , and the revelations about its circumstances , he became a symbol of excess and gluttony .
increasing attention , for instance , was paid to his appetite for the rich , heavy southern cooking of his upbringing , foods such as chicken-fried steak and biscuits and gravy .
in particular , his love of calorie-laden fried peanut butter , banana , and ( sometimes ) bacon sandwiches , now known as " elvis sandwiches " , came to stand for this aspect of his persona .
but the elvis sandwich represents more than just unhealthy overindulgence—as media and culture scholar robert thompson describes , the unsophisticated treat also signifies presley's enduring all-american appeal : " he wasn't only the king , he was one of us .
" since *num* , there have been numerous alleged sightings of presley .
a long-standing conspiracy theory among some fans is that he faked his death .
adherents cite alleged discrepancies in the death certificate , reports of a wax dummy in his original coffin , and accounts of presley planning a diversion so he could retire in peace .
an unusually large number of fans have domestic shrines devoted to presley and journey to sites with which he is connected , however faintly .
every august *num* , the anniversary of his " death " , thousands of people gather outside graceland and celebrate his memory with a candlelight ritual .
" with elvis , it is not just his music that has survived death " , writes ted harrison .
" he himself has been raised , like a medieval saint , to a figure of cultic status .
it is as if he has been canonized by acclamation .
" presley's earliest musical influence came from gospel .
his mother recalled that from the age of two , at the assembly of god church in tupelo attended by the family , " he would slide down off my lap , run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform .
there he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them .
" in memphis , presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the ellis auditorium , where groups such as the statesmen quartet led the music in a style that , guralnick suggests , sowed the seeds of presley's future stage act : as a teenager , presley's musical interests were wide-ranging , and he was deeply informed about both white and african-american musical idioms .
though he never had any formal training , he was blessed with a remarkable memory , and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged *num* in *num* .
when jerry leiber and mike stoller met him two years later , they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues , and , as stoller put it , " he certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music .
" at a press conference the following year , he proudly declared , " i know practically every religious song that's ever been written .
" presley was a central figure in the development of rockabilly , according to music historians .
" rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in *num* with elvis presley's first release , on the sun label " , writes craig morrison .
paul friedlander describes the defining elements of rockabilly , which he similarly characterizes as " essentially .
.
.
an elvis presley construction " : " the raw , emotive , and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [ of ] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [ of ] country " .
in " that's all right " , the presley trio's first record , scotty moore's guitar solo , " a combination of merle travis–style country finger-picking , double-stop slides from acoustic boogie , and blues-based bent-note , single-string work , is a microcosm of this fusion .
" while katherine charlton likewise calls presley " rockabilly's originator " , carl perkins has explicitly stated that " [ sam ] phillips , elvis , and i didn't create rockabilly .
" and , according to michael campbell , " bill haley recorded the first big rockabilly hit .
" in moore's view , too , " it had been there for quite a while , really .
carl perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around jackson , and i know for a fact jerry lee lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old .
" at rca , presley's rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals , more heavily amplified electric guitars and a tougher , more intense manner .
while he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a rockabilly / rock and roll treatment , he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career , from the pop standard " blue moon " at sun to the country ballad " how's the world treating you ? " on his second lp to the blues of " santa claus is back in town " .
in *num* , his first gospel record was released , the four-song ep " peace in the valley " .
certified as a million seller , it became the top-selling gospel ep in recording history .
presley would record gospel periodically for the rest of his life .
after his return from military service in *num* , presley continued to perform rock and roll , but the characteristic style was substantially toned down .
his first post-army single , the number one hit " stuck on you " , is typical of this shift .
rca publicity materials referred to its " mild rock beat " ; discographer ernst jorgensen calls it " upbeat pop " .
the number five " she's not you " ( *num* ) " integrates the jordanaires so completely , it's practically doo-wop " .
the modern blues / r&b sound captured with success on " elvis is back ! " was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966–67 recordings as " down in the alley " and " hi-heel sneakers " .
presley's output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music , often in the form of ballads such as " are you lonesome tonight ? " , a number one in *num* .
" it's now or never " , which also topped the chart that year , was a classically influenced variation of pop based on the neapolitan " ’o sole mio " and concluding with a " full-voiced operatic cadence " .
these were both dramatic numbers , but most of what presley recorded for his many film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein .
while presley performed several of his classic ballads for the ' *num* comeback special , the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll .
he would record few new straight-ahead rock and roll songs thereafter ; as he explained , they were " hard to find " .
a significant exception was " burning love " , his last major hit on the pop charts .
like his work of the 1950s , presley's subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs , but in markedly different permutations .
his stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and funk .
much of " elvis in memphis " , as well as " suspicious minds " , cut at the same sessions , reflected his new rock and soul fusion .
in the mid-1970s , many of his singles found a home on country radio , the field where he first became a star .
the developmental arc of presley's singing voice , as described by critic dave marsh , goes from " high and thrilled in the early days , [ to ] lower and perplexed in the final months .
" marsh credits presley with the introduction of the " vocal stutter " on 1955's " baby let's play house " .
when on " don't be cruel " , presley " slides into a ' mmmmm ' that marks the transition between the first two verses , " he shows " how masterful his relaxed style really is .
" marsh describes the vocal performance on " can't help falling in love " as one of " gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing " , with the line shall i stay ' pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal " .
jorgensen calls the *num* recording of " how great thou art " " an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions " , as presley " crafted for himself an ad-hoc arrangement in which he took every part of the four-part vocal , from [ the ] bass intro to the soaring heights of the song's operatic climax " , becoming " a kind of one-man quartet " .
guralnick finds " stand by me " from the same gospel sessions " a beautifully articulated , almost nakedly yearning performance , " but , by contrast , feels that presley reaches beyond his powers on " where no one stands alone " , resorting " to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound " that jake hess of the statesmen quartet had in his command .
hess himself thought that while others might have voices the equal of presley's , " he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime .
" guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something : " the warmth of his voice , his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range , the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort .
" marsh praises his *num* reading of " u .
s .
male " , " bearing down on the hard guy lyrics , not sending them up or overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that he brought to his sun records .
" the performance on " in the ghetto " is , according to jorgensen , " devoid of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms " , instead relying on the exceptional " clarity and sensitivity of his voice " .
guralnick describes the song's delivery as of " almost translucent eloquence .
.
.
so quietly confident in its simplicity " .
on " suspicious minds " , guralnick hears essentially the same " remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise " , but supplemented with " an expressive quality somewhere between stoicism ( at suspected infidelity ) and anguish ( over impending loss ) " .
music critic henry pleasants observes that " presley has been described variously as a baritone and a tenor .
an extraordinary compass .
.
.
and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion .
" he identifies presley as a high baritone , calculating his range as two octaves and a third , " from the baritone low g to the tenor high b , with an upward extension in falsetto to at least a d-flat .
presley's best octave is in the middle , d-flat to d-flat , granting an extra full step up or down .
" in pleasants ' view , his voice was " variable and unpredictable " at the bottom , " often brilliant " at the top , with the capacity for " full-voiced high gs and as that an opera baritone might envy " .
scholar lindsay waters , who figures presley's range as two-and-a-quarter octaves , emphasizes that " his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts , grunts , grumbles , and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender , to fear .
his voice can not be measured in octaves , but in decibels ; even that misses the problem of how to measure delicate whispers that are hardly audible at all .
" presley was always " able to duplicate the open , hoarse , ecstatic , screaming , shouting , wailing , reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers " , writes pleasants , and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles .
when dewey phillips first aired " that's all right " on memphis's whbq , many listeners who contacted the station by phone and telegram to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black .
from the beginning of his national fame , presley expressed respect for african-american performers and their music , and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the south .
interviewed in *num* , he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician arthur crudup—the originator of " that's all right"—"bang his box the way i do now , and i said if i ever got to the place where i could feel all old arthur felt , i'd be a music man like nobody ever saw .
" " the memphis world " , an african-american newspaper , reported that presley , " the rock ' n ' roll phenomenon " , " cracked memphis ' segregation laws " by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its " colored night " .
such statements and actions led presley to be generally hailed in the black community during the early days of his stardom .
in contrast , many white adults , according to " billboard"s arnold shaw , " did not like him , and condemned him as depraved .
anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism .
regardless of whether parents were aware of the negro sexual origins of the phrase ' rock ' n ' roll ' , presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex .
" despite the largely positive view of presley held by african americans , a rumor spread in mid-1957 that he had at some point announced , " the only thing negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes .
" a journalist with the national african-american weekly " jet " , louie robinson , pursued the story .
on the set of " jailhouse rock " , presley granted robinson an interview , though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press .
he denied making such a statement or holding in any way to its racist view : " i never said anything like that , and people who know me know that i wouldn't have said it .
.
.
.
a lot of people seem to think i started this business .
but rock ' n ' roll was here a long time before i came along .
nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people .
let's face it : i can't sing like fats domino can .
i know that .
" robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made , and on the contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that presley was anything but racist .
blues singer ivory joe hunter , who had heard the rumor before he visited graceland one evening , reported of presley , " he showed me every courtesy , and i think he's one of the greatest .
" though the rumored remark was wholly discredited at the time , it was still being used against presley decades later .
the identification of presley with racism—either personally or symbolically—was expressed most famously in the lyrics of the *num* rap hit " fight the power " , by public enemy : " elvis was a hero to most / but he never meant shit to me / straight-up racist that sucker was / simple and plain " .
the persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that presley , whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to african-american sources , achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers .
into the *ord* century , the notion that presley had " stolen " black music still found adherents .
notable among african-american entertainers expressly rejecting this view was jackie wilson , who argued , " a lot of people have accused elvis of stealing the black man's music , when in fact , almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from elvis .
" and throughout his career , presley plainly acknowledged his debt .
addressing his ' *num* comeback special audience , he said , " rock ' n ' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues , or it sprang from that .
people have been adding to it , adding instruments to it , experimenting with it , but it all boils down to [ that ] .
" nine years earlier , he had said , " rock ' n ' roll has been around for many years .
it used to be called rhythm and blues .
" presley's physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged .
" he was once beautiful , astonishingly beautiful " , in the words of critic mark feeney .
television director steve binder , no fan of presley's music before he oversaw the ' *num* comeback special , reported , " i'm straight as an arrow and i got to tell you , you stop , whether you're male or female , to look at him .
he was that good looking .
and if you never knew he was a superstar , it wouldn't make any difference ; if he'd walked in the room , you'd know somebody special was in your presence .
" his performance style , as much as his physical beauty , was responsible for presley's eroticized image .
writing in *num* , critic george melly described him as " the master of the sexual simile , treating his guitar as both phallus and girl " .
in his presley obituary , lester bangs credited him as " the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in america " .
ed sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar .
while presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality , some cultural critics have argued that his image was ambiguous .
in *num* , " sight and sound"s peter john dyer described his onscreen persona as " aggressively bisexual in appeal " .
brett farmer places the " orgasmic gyrations " of the title dance sequence in " jailhouse rock " within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a " spectacular eroticization , if not homoeroticization , of the male image " .
in the analysis of yvonne tasker , " elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised , objectifying version of white working-class masculinity as aggressive sexual display .
" reinforcing presley's image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with various hollywood stars and starlets , from natalie wood in the 1950s to connie stevens and ann-margret in the 1960s to candice bergen and cybill shepherd in the 1970s .
june juanico of memphis , one of presley's early girlfriends , later blamed parker for encouraging him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind .
presley never grew comfortable with the hollywood scene , and most of these relationships were insubstantial .
once he became presley's manager , colonel tom parker insisted on exceptionally tight control over his client's career .
early on , he and his hill and range allies , the brothers jean and julian aberbach , perceived the close relationship that developed between presley and songwriters jerry leiber and mike stoller as a serious threat to that control .
parker effectively ended the relationship , deliberately or not , with the new contract he sent leiber in early *num* .
leiber thought there was a mistake—the sheet of paper was blank except for parker's signature and a line on which to enter his .
" there's no mistake , boy , just sign it and return it " , parker directed .
" don't worry , we'll fill it in later .
" leiber declined , and presley's fruitful collaboration with the writing team was over .
other respected songwriters lost interest in or simply avoided writing for presley because of the requirement that they surrender a third of their usual royalties .
by *num* , parker's contracts gave him *num* percent of most of presley's earnings from recordings , films , and merchandise .
beginning in february *num* , he took a third of the profit from live appearances ; a january *num* agreement entitled him to half of that as well .
priscilla presley noted that " elvis detested the business side of his career .
he would sign a contract without even reading it .
" presley's friend marty lacker regarded parker as a " hustler and a con artist .
he was only interested in ' now money'—get the buck and get gone .
" lacker was instrumental in convincing presley to record with memphis producer chips moman and his handpicked musicians at american sound studio in early *num* .
the american sound sessions represented a significant departure from the control customarily exerted by hill and range .
moman still had to deal with the publisher's staff on site , whose song suggestions he regarded as unacceptable .
he was on the verge of quitting , until presley ordered the hill and range personnel out of the studio .
although rca executive joan deary was later full of praise for the producer's song choices and the quality of the recordings , moman , to his fury , received neither credit on the records nor royalties for his work .
throughout his entire career , presley performed in only three venues outside the united states—all of them in canada , during brief tours there in *num* .
in *num* , he remarked , " before too long i'm going to make some personal appearance tours .
i'll probably start out here in this country and after that , play some concerts abroad , probably starting in europe .
i want to see some places i've never seen before .
" rumors that he would play overseas for the first time were fueled in *num* by a million-dollar bid for an australian tour .
parker was uncharacteristically reluctant , prompting those close to presley to speculate about the manager's past and the reasons for his evident unwillingness to apply for a passport .
after presley's death , it was revealed that parker was born andreas cornelis van kuijk in the netherlands ; having immigrated illegally to the u .
s .
, he had reason to fear that if he left the country , he would not be allowed back in again .
parker ultimately squelched any notions presley had of working abroad , claiming that foreign security was poor and the venues unsuitable for a star of his magnitude .
parker arguably exercised tightest control over presley's film career .
hal wallis said , " i'd rather try and close a deal with the devil " than with parker .
fellow film producer sam katzman described him as " the biggest con artist in the world " .
in *num* , robert mitchum asked presley to costar with him in " thunder road " , which mitchum was producing and writing .
according to george klein , one of his oldest friends , presley was also offered starring roles in " west side story " and " midnight cowboy " .
in *num* , barbra streisand approached presley to star with her in the remake of " a star is born " .
in each case , any ambitions presley may have had to play such parts were thwarted by his manager's negotiating demands or flat refusals .
in lacker's description , " the only thing that kept elvis going after the early years was a new challenge .
but parker kept running everything into the ground .
" the prevailing attitude may have been summed up best by the response leiber and stoller received when they brought a serious film project for presley to parker and the hill and range owners for their consideration .
in leiber's telling , jean aberbach warned them to never again " try to interfere with the business or artistic workings of the process known as elvis presley " .
in the early 1960s , the circle of friends with whom presley constantly surrounded himself until his death came to be known as the " memphis mafia " .
" surrounded by the [ ir ] parasitic presence " , as journalist john harris puts it , " it was no wonder that as he slid into addiction and torpor , no-one raised the alarm : to them , elvis was the bank , and it had to remain open .
" tony brown , who played piano for presley regularly in the last two years of presley's life , observed his rapidly declining health and the urgent need to address it : " but we all knew it was hopeless because elvis was surrounded by that little circle of people .
.
.
all those so-called friends " .
in the memphis mafia's defense , marty lacker has said , " [ presley ] was his own man .
.
.
.
if we hadn't been around , he would have been dead a lot earlier .
" larry geller became presley's hairdresser in *num* .
unlike others in the memphis mafia , he was interested in spiritual questions and recalls how , from their first conversation , presley revealed his secret thoughts and anxieties : " i mean there " has " to be a purpose .
.
.
there's got to be a reason .
.
.
why i was chosen to be elvis presley .
.
.
.
i swear to god , no one knows how lonely i get .
and how empty i really feel .
" thereafter , geller supplied him with books on religion and mysticism , which presley read voraciously .
presley would be preoccupied by such matters for much of his life , taking trunkloads of books on tour .
presley's rise to national attention in *num* transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture .
as the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll , he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude .
with its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by presley—rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream american culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture .
in this regard , little richard said of presley , " he was an integrator .
elvis was a blessing .
they wouldn't let black music through .
he opened the door for black music .
" al green agreed : " he broke the ice for all of us .
" president jimmy carter remarked on his legacy in *num* : " his music and his personality , fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues , permanently changed the face of american popular culture .
his following was immense , and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality , rebelliousness , and good humor of his country .
" presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication : at the age of *num* , within a year of his first appearance on american network television , he was one of the most famous people in the world .
presley's name , image , and voice are instantly recognizable around the globe .
he has inspired a legion of impersonators .
in polls and surveys , he is recognized as one of the most important popular music artists and influential americans .
" elvis presley is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century " , said composer and conductor leonard bernstein .
" he introduced the beat to everything and he changed everything—music , language , clothes .
it's a whole new social revolution—the sixties came from it .
" in the words of john lennon , " nothing really affected me until elvis .
" bob dylan described the sensation of first hearing presley as " like busting out of jail " .
on the *ord* anniversary of presley's death , " the new york times " asserted , " all the talentless impersonators and appalling black velvet paintings on display can make him seem little more than a perverse and distant memory .
but before elvis was camp , he was its opposite : a genuine cultural force .
.
.
.
elvis's breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rock-and-roll age , his hard-rocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely .
" not only presley's achievements , but his failings as well , are seen by some cultural observers as adding to the power of his legacy , as in this description by greil marcus : elvis presley is a supreme figure in american life , one whose presence , no matter how banal or predictable , brooks no real comparisons .
.
.
.
the cultural range of his music has expanded to the point where it includes not only the hits of the day , but also patriotic recitals , pure country gospel , and really dirty blues .
.
.
.
elvis has emerged as a great " artist , " a great " rocker , " a great " purveyor of schlock , " a great " heart throb , " a great " bore , " a great " symbol of potency , " a great " ham , " a great " nice person , " and , yes , a great american .
to this day , presley remains the best selling solo artist , with sales estimates ranging from *num* million to *num* billion sales .
presley holds the records for most songs charting in " billboard"s top *ord* top *num* : *num* , according to chart statistician joel whitburn , *num* according to presley historian adam victor .
presley's rankings for top ten and number one hits vary depending on how the double-sided " hound dog / don't be cruel " and " don't / i beg of you " singles , which precede the inception of " billboard"s unified hot *num* chart , are analyzed .
according to whitburn's analysis , presley holds the record with *num* , tying with madonna ; per " billboard"s current assessment , he ranks second with *num* .
whitburn and " billboard " concur that the beatles hold the record for most number one hits with *num* , and that mariah carey is second with *num* .
whitburn has presley also with *num* , and thus tied for second ; " billboard " has him third with *num* .
presley retains the record for cumulative weeks at number one : alone at *num* , according to whitburn and the rock and roll hall of fame ; tied with carey at *num* , according to " billboard " .
he holds the records for most british number one hits with *num* , and top ten hits with *num* .
as an album artist , presley is credited by " billboard " with the record for the most albums charting in the " billboard " *num* : *num* , far ahead of second-place frank sinatra's *num* .
he also holds the record for most time spent at number one on the " billboard " *num* : *num* weeks .
in *num* and *num* , two albums setting presley's vocals against music by the royal philharmonic orchestra , " if i can dream " and " the wonder of you " , both reached number one in the united kingdom .
this gave him a new record for number one u .
k .
albums by a solo artist with *num* , and extended his record for longest span between number one albums by anybody—presley had first topped the british chart in *num* with his self-titled debut .
, the recording industry association of america ( riaa ) credits presley with *num* .
*num* million certified album sales in the u .
s .
, third all time behind the beatles and garth brooks .
he holds the records for most gold albums ( *num* , more than twice as many as second-place barbra streisand's *num* ) , most platinum albums ( *num* ) , and most multi-platinum albums ( *num* ) .
his total of *num* album certification awards ( including one diamond award ) , far outpaces the beatles ' second-best *num* .
he has the most gold singles ( *num* ) and the fourth-most platinum singles ( *num* , behind rihanna , taylor swift , and chris brown ) .
in *num* the spider " paradonea presleyi " was named in his honor .
in *num* , president donald trump awarded presley the presidential medal of freedom posthumously .
a vast number of recordings have been issued under presley's name .
the total number of his original master recordings has been variously calculated as *num* and *num* .
his career began and he was most successful during an era when singles were the primary commercial medium for pop music .
in the case of his albums , the distinction between " official " studio records and other forms is often blurred .
for most of the 1960s , his recording career focused on soundtrack albums .
in the 1970s , his most heavily promoted and best-selling lp releases tended to be concert albums .
alphonse , count of poitiers alphonse or alfonso ( *num* november *num* august *num* ) was the count of poitou from *num* and count of toulouse ( as alphonse ii ) from *num* .
as count of toulouse , he also governed the marquisate of provence .
born at poissy , alphonse was a son of louis viii , king of france and blanche of castile .
he was a younger brother of louis ix of france and an older brother of charles i of sicily .
in *num* , his mother , who was regent of france , forced the treaty of paris on raymond vii of toulouse after his rebellion .
it stipulated that a brother of king louis was to marry joan of toulouse , daughter of raymond vii of toulouse , and so in *num* alphonse married her .
since she was raymond's only child , they became rulers of toulouse at raymond's death in *num* .
by the terms of his father's will he received an " appanage " of poitou and auvergne .
to enforce this louis ix won the battle of taillebourg in the saintonge war together with alphonse against a revolt allied with king henry iii of england , who also participated in the battle .
alphonse took part in two crusades with his brother , st louis , in *num* ( the seventh crusade ) and in *num* ( the eighth crusade ) .
for the first of these , he raised a large sum and a substantial force , arriving in damietta on *num* october *num* , after the town had already been captured .
he sailed for home on *num* august *num* .
his father-in-law had died while he was away , and he went directly to toulouse to take possession .
there was some resistance to his accession as count , which was suppressed with the help of his mother blanche of castile who was acting as regent in the absence of louis ix .
the county of toulouse , since then , was joined to alphonse's " appanage " .
in *num* , on the death of his mother , blanche of castile , alphonse was joint regent with charles of anjou until the return of louis ix .
during that time he took a great part in the campaigns and negotiations which led to the treaty of paris in *num* , under which king henry iii of england recognized his loss of continental territory to france ( including normandy , maine , anjou , and poitou ) in exchange for france withdrawing support from english rebels .
aside from the crusades , alphonse stayed primarily in paris , governing his estates by officials , inspectors who reviewed the officials ' work , and a constant stream of messages .
his main work was on his own estates .
there he repaired the evils of the albigensian war and made a first attempt at administrative centralization , thus preparing the way for union with the crown .
he is remembered for founding the bastide town of villeneuve-sur-lot which straddles the river lot and still contains many of its original structures , including one of the first bridges across the river .
the charter known as " alphonsine , " granted to the town of riom , became the code of public law for auvergne .
honest and moderate , protecting the middle classes against exactions of the nobles , he exercised a happy influence upon the south , in spite of his naturally despotic character and his continual and pressing need of money .
he is noted for ordering the first recorded local expulsion of jews , when he did so in poitou in *num* .
when louis ix again engaged in a crusade ( the eighth crusade ) , alphonse again raised a large sum of money and accompanied his brother .
this time , however , he did not return to france , dying while on his way back , probably at savona in italy , on *num* august *num* .
alphonse's death without heirs raised some questions as to the succession to his lands .
one possibility was that they should revert to the crown , another that they should be redistributed to his family .
the latter was claimed by charles of anjou , but in *num* parlement decided that the county of toulouse should revert to the crown , if there were no male heirs .
alphonse's wife joan ( who died four days after alphonse ) had attempted to dispose of some of her inherited lands in her will .
joan was the only surviving child and heiress of raymond vii , count of toulouse , duke of narbonne , and marquis of provence , so under provençal and french law , the lands should have gone to her nearest male relative .
but , her will was invalidated by parlement in *num* .
one specific bequest in alphonse's will , giving his wife's lands in the comtat venaissin to the holy see , was allowed , and it became a papal territory , a status that it retained until *num* .
dejima , in old western documents latinised as " deshima " , " decima " , " desjima " , " dezima " , " disma " , or " disima " , was a dutch trading post notable for being the single place of direct trade and exchange between japan and the outside world during the edo period .
it was a small fan-shaped artificial island formed by digging a canal through a small peninsula in the bay of nagasaki in *num* by local merchants .
dejima was built to constrain foreign traders .
originally built to house portuguese traders , it was used by the dutch as a trading post from *num* until *num* .
covering an area of or , it was later integrated into the city through the process of land reclamation .
in *num* , the " dejima dutch trading post " was designated a japanese national historic site .
in *num* , the history of direct contacts between japan and europe began with the arrival of storm-blown portuguese merchants on tanegashima .
six years later the jesuit missionary francis xavier landed in kagoshima .
at first portuguese traders were based in hirado , but they moved in search of a better port .
in *num* " daimyō " ōmura sumitada converted to catholicism ( choosing bartolomeu as his christian name ) and made a deal with the portuguese to develop nagasaki ; soon the port was open for trade .
in *num* sumitada gave the jurisdiction of nagasaki to the jesuits , and the portuguese obtained the " de facto " monopoly on the silk trade with china through macau .
the " shōgun " iemitsu ordered the construction of the artificial island in *num* , to accommodate the portuguese traders living in nagasaki and prevent the propagation of their religion .
this was one of the many edicts put forth by iemitsu between *num* and *num* moderating contact between japan and other countries .
however , in response to the uprising of the predominantly christian population in the shimabara-amakusa region , the tokugawa government decided to expel the portuguese in *num* .
since *num* , the dutch east india company had run a trading post on the island of hirado .
the departure of the portuguese left the dutch employees of the " vereenigde oostindische compagnie " ( " voc " ) as the sole westerners with trade access to japan .
for *num* years they were allowed to trade relatively freely .
at its maximum the hirado trading post covered a large area .
in *num* and *num* stone warehouses were constructed within the ambit of this hirado trading post .
christian-era year dates were used on the stonework of the new warehouses and these were used in *num* as a pretext to demolish the buildings and relocate the trading post to nagasaki .
with the expulsion of the last portuguese in *num* , dejima became a failed commercial post and without the annual trading with portuguese ships from macau , the economy of nagasaki suffered greatly .
the dutch were forced by government officials to move from hirado to dejima in nagasaki .
from *num* on , only chinese and dutch ships were allowed to come to japan , and nagasaki harbor was the only harbor they were allowed to enter .
on the administrative level , the island of dejima was part of the city of nagasaki .
the *num* local japanese families who owned the land received an annual rent from the dutch .
dejima was a small island , by , linked to the mainland by a small bridge , guarded on both sides , and with a gate on the dutch side .
it contained houses for about twenty dutchmen , warehouses , and accommodation for japanese officials .
the dutch were watched by a number of japanese officials , gatekeepers , night watchmen , and a supervisor ( " otona " 乙名 ) with about fifty subordinates .
numerous merchants supplied goods and catering , and about *num* interpreters ( " tsūji " 通詞 ) served .
they all had to be paid by the " voc " .
like the city of nagasaki , dejima was under the direct supervision of edo through a governor ( " nagasaki bugyō " ) .
every ship that arrived in dejima was inspected .
its sails were held by the japanese until they released the ship to leave .
they confiscated religious books and weapons .
the dutch were not allowed to hold any religious services on the island .
despite the financial burden of maintaining the isolated outpost on dejima , the trade with japan was very profitable for the dutch , initially yielding profits of *num* % or more .
trade declined in the *ord* century , as only two ships per year were allowed to dock at dejima .
after the bankruptcy of the east-india company in *num* , the dutch government took over exchange with japan .
times were especially hard when the netherlands ( then called the batavian republic ) was under french napoleonic rule .
all ties with the homeland were severed at dejima , and for a while , it was the only place in the world where the dutch flag was flown .
the chief dutch official in japan was called the " opperhoofd " by the dutch , or " kapitan " ( from portuguese " capitão " ) by the japanese .
this descriptive title did not change when the island's trading fell under dutch state authority .
throughout these years , the plan was to have one incumbent per year—but sometimes plans needed to be flexible .
originally , the dutch mainly traded in silk , cotton , and " materia medica " from china and india , but sugar became more important later .
also , deer pelts and shark skin were transported to japan from taiwan , as well as books , scientific instruments and many other rarities from europe .
in return , the dutch traders bought japanese copper , silver , camphor , porcelain , lacquer ware and rice .
to this was added the personal trade of voc employees on dejima , which was an important source of income for them and their japanese counterparts .
they sold more than *num* , *num* foreign books on various scientific subjects to the japanese from the end of the *ord* to the early *ord* century .
these became the basis of knowledge and a factor in the " rangaku " movement , or dutch studies .
in all , *num* dutch ships arrived at dejima during its two centuries of settlement , from *num* to *num* .
for two hundred years , foreign merchants were generally not allowed to cross from dejima to nagasaki .
the japanese were likewise banned from entering dejima , except interpreters , cooks , carpenters , clerks and ' women of pleasure ' from the maruyama teahouses .
these " yūjo " were handpicked from *num* by the japanese , often against their will .
from the *ord* century , there were some exceptions to this rule , especially following tokugawa yoshimune's doctrine of promoting european practical sciences .
a few " oranda-yuki " ( " those who stay with the dutch " ) were allowed to stay for longer periods , but they had to report regularly to the japanese guard post .
once a year the europeans were allowed to attend the festivities at the suwa-shrine under escort .
sometimes physicians such as engelbert kaempfer , carl peter thunberg , and philipp franz von siebold were called to high-ranking japanese patients with the permission of the authorities .
starting in the *ord* century , dejima became known throughout japan as a center of medicine , military science , and astronomy .
many samurai traveled there for " dutch studies " ( rangaku ) .
in addition , the " opperhoofd " was treated like the representative of a tributary state , which meant that he had to pay a visit of homage to the " shōgun " in edo .
the dutch delegation traveled to edo yearly between *num* and *num* , and once every four years thereafter .
this prerogative was denied to the chinese traders .
the lengthy travel to the shogunal court broke the boredom of the dutch stay , but it was a costly affair .
government officials told them in advance and in detail which ( expensive ) gifts were expected at the court , such as astrolabes , a pair of glasses , telescopes , globes , medical instruments , medical books , or exotic animals and tropical birds .
in return , the dutch delegation received some gifts from the " shōgun " .
on arrival in edo , the " opperhoofd " and his retinue ( usually his scribe and the factory physician ) had to wait in the " nagasakiya " ( ) , their mandatory residence , until they were summoned at the court .
during the reign of the somewhat eccentric " shōgun " tokugawa tsunayoshi , they were expected to perform dutch dances and songs for the amusement of the " shōgun " after their official audience , according to engelbert kaempfer .
but they also used the opportunity of their stay of about two to three weeks in the capital to exchange knowledge with learned japanese and , under escort , to visit the town .
following the forced opening of japan by us navy commodore perry in *num* , the bakufu suddenly increased its interactions with dejima in an effort to build up knowledge of western shipping methods .
the , a naval training institute , was established in *num* by the government of the " shōgun " at the entrance of dejima , to enable maximum interaction with dutch naval know-how .
the center was equipped with japan's first steamship , the " kankō maru " , given by the government of the netherlands the same year .
the future admiral enomoto takeaki was one of the students of the training center .
the dutch east india company's trading post at dejima was abolished when japan concluded the treaty of kanagawa with the usa in *num* .
this ended dejima's role as japan's only window on the western world during the era of national isolation .
since then , the island was expanded by reclaimed land and merged into nagasaki .
extensive redesigning of nagasaki harbor in *num* obscured its original location .
the original footprint of dejima island has been marked by rivets ; but as restoration progresses , the ambit of the island will be easier to see at a glance .
dejima today is a work in progress .
the island was designated a national historical site in *num* , but further steps were slow to follow .
restoration work was started in *num* , but that project languished .
in *num* , restoration of dejima began with plans for reconstructing *num* buildings in their early 19th-century state .
to better display dejima's fan-shaped form , the project anticipated rebuilding only parts of the surrounding embankment wall that had once enclosed the island .
buildings that remained from the meiji period were to be used .
in *num* , five buildings including the deputy factor's quarters were completed and opened to the public .
in the spring of *num* , the finishing touches were put on the chief factor's residence , the japanese officials ' office , the head clerk's quarters , the no .
*num* warehouse , and the sea gate .
currently some *num* buildings throughout the area have been restored .
in *num* , six new buildings as well as the ' omotemon-bashi bridge ' ( the old bridge to the mainland ) were restored .
the bridge was officially opened in attendance of members of the japanese and dutch royal families .
the long-term planning intends that dejima will be surrounded by water on all four sides ; its characteristic fan-shaped form and all of its embankment walls will be fully restored .
this long-term plan will include large-scale urban redevelopment in the area .
to make dejima an island again will require rerouting the nakashima river and moving a part of route *num* .
opperhoofd is a dutch word ( plural " opperhoofden " ) which literally means ' supreme head [ man ] ' .
the japanese used to call the trading post chiefs " kapitan " which is derived from portuguese " capitão " ( cf .
latin " caput " , head ) .
in its historical usage , the word is a gubernatorial title , comparable to the english chief factor , for the chief executive officer of a dutch " factory " in the sense of trading post , as led by a factor , i .

chadic languages the chadic languages form a branch of the afroasiatic language family .
they are spoken in parts of the sahel .
they include *num* languages spoken across northern nigeria , southern niger , southern chad , central african republic and northern cameroon .
the most widely spoken chadic language is hausa , a lingua franca of much of inland eastern west africa .
newman ( *num* ) classified the languages into four groups which have been accepted in all subsequent literature .
further subbranching , however , has not been as robust ; blench ( *num* ) , for example , only accepts the a / b bifurcation of east chadic .
several modern genetic studies of chadic speaking groups in the northern cameroon region have observed high frequencies of the y-chromosome haplogroup r1b in these populations ( specifically , of r1b's r-v88 variant ) .
this paternal marker is common in parts of west eurasia , but otherwise rare in africa .
cruciani et al .
( *num* ) thus propose that the proto-chadic speakers during the mid-holocene ( ~7 , *num* years ago ) migrated from the levant to the central sahara , and from there settled in the lake chad basin .
chadic languages contain many nilo-saharan loanwords from either the songhay or maban branches , pointing to early contact between chadic and nilo-saharan speakers as chadic was migrating west .
although adamawa languages are spoken adjacently to chadic languages , interaction between chadic and adamawa is limited .
axayacatl axayacatl ( ; ; ; meaning " face of water " ; –1481 ) was the sixth of the of tenochtitlan and ruler of the aztec triple alliance .
axayacatl was a son of the princess atotoztli ii and her cousin , prince tezozomoc .
he was a grandson of the emperors moctezuma i and itzcoatl .
he was a descendant of the king cuauhtototzin .
he was a successor of moctezuma and his brothers were emperors tizoc and ahuitzotl and his sister was the queen chalchiuhnenetzin .
he was an uncle of the emperor cuauhtémoc and father of emperors moctezuma ii and cuitláhuac .
during his youth , his military prowess gained him the favor influential figures such as nezahualcoyotl and tlacaelel i , and thus , upon the death of moctezuma i in *num* , he was chosen to ascend to the throne , much to the displeasure of his two older brothers , tizoc and ahuitzotl .
it is also important that the great sun stone , also known as the aztec calendar , was carved under his leadership .
in the year *num* there was a major earthquake that destroyed many homes in tenochtitlán .
using as a pretext the insulting behavior of a few tlatelolcan citizens , axayacatl invaded his neighbor , killed its ruler , moquihuix , and replaced him with a military governor .
the tlatelolcans lost any voice they had in forming aztec policy .
axayacatl largely dedicated his twelve-year reign to consolidating his militaristic repute : he led successful campaigns against the neighboring of tlatelolco in *num* and the matlatzinca of the toluca valley in *num* , but was finally defeated by the tarascans of michoacán in *num* .
despite some subsequent minor triumphs , axayacatl's defeat at the hands of the tarascans irreversibly marred his image , as it constituted the only major defeat suffered by the aztecs up to that moment .
in spite of his young age , he fell gravely ill in *num* , passing away a mere year later , in *num* , whereupon he was succeeded by his brother tizoc .
chives chives , scientific name allium schoenoprasum , are an edible species of the genus " allium " .
their close relatives include the garlic , shallot , leek , scallion , and chinese onion .
a perennial plant , it is widespread in nature across much of europe , asia , and north america .
"a .
schoenoprasum " is the only species of " allium " native to both the new and the old worlds .
chives are a commonly used herb and can be found in grocery stores or grown in home gardens .
in culinary use , the scapes and the unopened , immature flower buds are diced and used as an ingredient for fish , potatoes , soups , and other dishes .
the edible flowers can be used in salads .
chives have insect-repelling properties that can be used in gardens to control pests .
the plant provides a great deal of nectar for pollinators .
it was rated in the top *num* for most nectar production ( nectar per unit cover per year ) in a uk plants survey conducted by the agriland project which is supported by the uk insect pollinators initiative .
chives are a bulb-forming herbaceous perennial plant , growing to tall .
the bulbs are slender , conical , long and broad , and grow in dense clusters from the roots .
the scapes ( or stems ) are hollow and tubular , up to long and across , with a soft texture , although , prior to the emergence of a flower , they may appear stiffer than usual .
the grass-like leaves , which are shorter than the scapes , are also hollow and tubular , or terete , ( round in cross-section ) which distinguishes it at a glance from garlic chives ( " allium tuberosum " ) .
the flowers are pale purple , and star-shaped with six petals , wide , and produced in a dense inflorescence of 10-30 together ; before opening , the inflorescence is surrounded by a papery bract .
the seeds are produced in a small , three-valved capsule , maturing in summer .
the herb flowers from april to may in the southern parts of its habitat zones and in june in the northern parts .
chives are the only species of " allium " native to both the new and the old worlds .
sometimes , the plants found in north america are classified as " a .
schoenoprasum " var .
" sibiricum " , although this is disputed .
differences between specimens are significant .
one example was found in northern maine growing solitary , instead of in clumps , also exhibiting dingy grey flowers .
although chives are repulsive to insects in general , due to their sulfur compounds , their flowers attract bees , and they are at times kept to increase desired insect life .
it was formerly described by the swedish botanist carl linnaeus in his seminal publication ' species plantarum ' in *num* , on page *num* .
the name of the species derives from the greek σχοίνος , " skhoínos " ( sedge or rush ) and πράσον , " práson " ( leek ) .
its english name , chives , derives from the french word " cive " , from " cepa " , the latin word for onion .
in the middle ages , it was known as ' rush leek ' .
it has *num* known subspecies ; " allium schoenoprasum " subsp .

chives are native to temperate areas of europe , asia and north america .
it is found in asia within the caucasus ( in armenia , azerbaijan and georgia ) , also in china , iran , iraq , japan ( within the provinces of hokkaido and honshu ) , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , mongolia , pakistan , russian federation ( within the provinces of kamchatka , khabarovsk , and primorye ) siberia and turkey .
in middle europe , it is found within austria , the czech republic , germany , the netherlands , poland and switzerland .
in northern europe , in denmark , finland , norway , sweden and the united kingdom .
in southeastern europe , within bulgaria , greece , italy and romania .
it is also found in southwestern europe , in france , portugal and spain .
in northern america , it is found in canada ( within the provinces of alberta , british columbia , nova scotia , new brunswick , newfoundland , nunavut , ontario , prince edward island , quebec , saskatchewan and yukon ) , in the united states ( with the states of alaska , colorado , connecticut , idaho , maine , maryland , massachusetts , michigan , minnesota , montana , new hampshire , new jersey , new york , ohio , oregon , pennsylvania , rhode island , vermont , washington , west virginia , wisconsin and wyoming ) .
chives are grown for their scapes and leaves , which are used for culinary purposes as a flavoring herb , and provide a somewhat milder flavor than those of other " allium " species .
chives have a wide variety of culinary uses , such as in traditional dishes in france , sweden , and elsewhere .
in his *num* book " attempt at a flora " ( " försök til en flora " ) , retzius describes how chives are used with pancakes , soups , fish , and sandwiches .
they are also an ingredient of the " gräddfil " sauce with the traditional herring dish served at swedish midsummer celebrations .
the flowers may also be used to garnish dishes .
in poland and germany , chives are served with quark cheese .
chives are one of the " fines herbes " of french cuisine , the others being tarragon , chervil and parsley .
chives can be found fresh at most markets year-round , making them readily available ; they can also be dry-frozen without much impairment to the taste , giving home growers the opportunity to store large quantities harvested from their own gardens .
retzius also describes how farmers would plant chives between the rocks making up the borders of their flowerbeds , to keep the plants free from pests ( such as japanese beetles ) .
the growing plant repels unwanted insect life , and the juice of the leaves can be used for the same purpose , as well as fighting fungal infections , mildew , and scab .
the medicinal properties of chives are similar to those of garlic , but weaker ; the faint effects in comparison with garlic are probably the main reason for their limited use as a medicinal herb .
they also have mild stimulant , diuretic , and antiseptic properties .
as chives are usually served in small amounts and never as the main dish , negative effects are rarely encountered , although digestive problems may occur following overconsumption .
chives are also rich in vitamins a and c , contain organosulfur compounds , and are rich in calcium and iron .
chives are cultivated both for their culinary uses and their ornamental value ; the violet flowers are often used in ornamental dry bouquets .
the flowers are also edible and are used in salads , or used to make blossom vinegars .
chives thrive in well-drained soil , rich in organic matter , with a ph of 6-7 and full sun .
they can be grown from seed and mature in summer , or early the following spring .
typically , chives need to be germinated at a temperature of *num* to *num* °c ( 60-70 °f ) and kept moist .
they can also be planted under a cloche or germinated indoors in cooler climates , then planted out later .
after at least four weeks , the young shoots should be ready to be planted out .
they are also easily propagated by division .
in cold regions , chives die back to the underground bulbs in winter , with the new leaves appearing in early spring .
chives starting to look old can be cut back to about 2–5 cm .
when harvesting , the needed number of stalks should be cut to the base .
during the growing season , the plant continually regrows leaves , allowing for a continuous harvest .
chives are susceptible to damage by leek moth larvae , which bore into the leaves or bulbs of the plant .
chives have been cultivated in europe since the middle ages ( fifth until the *ord* centuries ) , although their usage dates back *num* years .
they were sometimes referred to as " rush leeks " .
it was mentioned in *num* a .
d .
by marcus valerius martialis in his " epigrams " .
the romans believed chives could relieve the pain from sunburn or a sore throat .
they believed eating chives could increase blood pressure and act as a diuretic .
romani have used chives in fortune telling .
bunches of dried chives hung around a house were believed to ward off disease and evil .
in the *ord* century , dutch farmers fed cattle on the herb to give a different taste to milk .
christian social union in bavaria the christian social union in bavaria ( , csu ) is a christian-democratic and conservative political party in germany .
the csu operates only in bavaria while its larger counterpart , the christian democratic union ( cdu ) , operates in the other fifteen states of germany .
it differs from the cdu by being somewhat more conservative in social matters .
the csu is considered an effective successor of the weimar-era catholic bavarian people's party ( bvp ) .
at the federal level , the csu forms a common faction in the bundestag with the cdu , which is frequently referred to as the union faction ( " die unionsfraktion " ) .
the csu has had *num* seats in the bundestag since the *num* federal election , making it the smallest of the seven parties represented .
until the *num* federal election , the cdu / csu formed federal government in coalition with the free democratic party ( fdp ) .
the csu is a member of the european people's party ( epp ) and the international democrat union .
the csu currently has three ministers in the cabinet of germany of the federal government in berlin , including party leader horst seehofer who is federal minister of the interior while party member markus söder serves as minister-president of bavaria , a position that csu representatives have held from *num* to *num* and again since *num* .
franz josef strauß ( 1915–1988 ) had left behind the strongest legacy as a leader of the party , having led the party from *num* until his death in *num* .
his political career in the federal cabinet was unique in that he had served four ministerial posts in the years between *num* and *num* .
from *num* until his death in *num* , strauß served as the minister-president of bavaria .
strauß was the first leader of the csu to be a candidate for the german chancellery in *num* .
in the *num* federal election , strauß ran against the incumbent helmut schmidt of the social democratic party of germany ( spd ) , but lost thereafter as the spd and the free democratic party ( fdp ) managed to secure an absolute majority together , forming a social-liberal coalition .
the csu has led the bavarian state government since it came into existence in *num* , save from *num* to *num* when the spd formed a state government in coalition with the bavaria party and the state branches of the gb / bhe and fdp .
before the *num* elections in bavaria , the csu perennially achieved absolute majorities at the state level by itself .
this level of dominance is unique among germany's *num* states .
edmund stoiber took over the csu leadership in *num* .
he ran for chancellor of germany in *num* , but his preferred cdu / csu–fdp coalition lost against the spd candidate gerhard schröder's spd–green alliance .
in the *num* bavarian state election , the csu won *num* .
*num* % of the vote and *num* of *num* seats in the state parliament .
this was the first time any party had won a two thirds majority in a german state parliament .
" the economist " later suggested that this exceptional result was due to a backlash against schröder's government in berlin .
the csu's popularity declined in subsequent years .
stoiber stepped down from the posts of minister-president and csu chairman in september *num* .
a year later , the csu lost its majority in the *num* bavarian state election , with its vote share dropping from *num* .
*num* % to *num* .
*num* % .
the csu remained in power by forming a coalition with the fdp .
in the *num* general election , the csu received only *num* .
*num* % of the vote in bavaria in the *num* election , which constitutes its weakest showing in the party's history .
the csu made gains in the *num* bavarian state election and the *num* federal election , which were held a week apart in september *num* .
the csu regained their majority in the bavarian landtag and remained in government in berlin .
they have three ministers in angela merkel's current cabinet , namely horst seehofer ( minister of the interior , building and community ) , andreas scheuer ( minister of transport and digital infrastructure ) and gerd müller ( minister for economic cooperation and development ) .
the csu forms after bavarian state election , *num* on october *num* , *num* a new government with partner free voters of bavaria .
the csu is the sister party of the christian democratic union ( cdu ) .
together , they are called the union .
the csu operates only within bavaria and the cdu operates in all other states , but not bavaria .
while virtually independent , at the federal level the parties form a common cdu / csu faction .
no chancellor has ever come from the csu , although strauß and edmund stoiber were cdu / csu candidates for chancellor in the *num* federal election and the *num* federal election , respectively , which were both won by the social democratic party of germany ( spd ) .
below the federal level , the parties are entirely independent .
since its formation , the csu has been more conservative than the cdu .
the csu and the state of bavaria decided not to sign the " grundgesetz " of the federal republic of germany as they could not agree with the division of germany into two states after world war ii .
although bavaria like all german states has a separate police and justice system ( distinctive and non-federal ) , the csu has actively participated in all political affairs of the german parliament , the german government , the german bundesrat , the parliamentary elections of the german president , the european parliament and meetings with mikhail gorbachev in russia .
the csu has contributed eleven of the twelve ministers-president of bavaria since *num* , with only wilhelm hoegner ( 1945–1946 , 1954–1957 ) of the spd also holding the office .

euclid euclid ( ; – " eukleídēs " , ; fl .
*num* bc ) , sometimes given the name euclid of alexandria to distinguish him from euclides of megara , was a greek mathematician , often referred to as the " founder of geometry " or the " father of geometry " .
he was active in alexandria during the reign of ptolemy i ( 323–283 bc ) .
his " elements " is one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics , serving as the main textbook for teaching mathematics ( especially geometry ) from the time of its publication until the late *ord* or early *ord* century .
in the " elements " , euclid deduced the theorems of what is now called euclidean geometry from a small set of axioms .
euclid also wrote works on perspective , conic sections , spherical geometry , number theory , and rigor .
euclid is the anglicized version of the greek name εὐκλείδης , which means " renowned , glorious " .
very few original references to euclid survive , so little is known about his life .
he was likely born c .
*num* bc , although the place and circumstances of both his birth and death are unknown and may only be estimated roughly relative to other people mentioned with him .
he is rarely mentioned by name by other greek mathematicians from archimedes ( c .
*num* bc – c .
*num* bc ) onward , and is usually referred to as " ὁ στοιχειώτης " ( " the author of elements " ) .
the few historical references to euclid were written centuries after he lived , namely by proclus c .
*num* ad .
a detailed biography of euclid is given by arabian authors , mentioning , for example , a birth town of tyre .
this biography is generally believed to be fictitious .
if he came from alexandria , he would have known the serapeum of alexandria , and the library of alexandria , and may have worked there during his time .
euclid's arrival in alexandria came about ten years after its founding by alexander the great , which means he arrived c .
*num* bc .
proclus introduces euclid only briefly in his " commentary on the elements " .
according to proclus , euclid supposedly belonged to plato's " persuasion " and brought together the " elements " , drawing on prior work of eudoxus of cnidus and of several pupils of plato ( particularly theaetetus and philip of opus .
) proclus believes that euclid is not much younger than these , and that he must have lived during the time of ptolemy i ( c .
*num* bc – *num* bc ) because he was mentioned by archimedes .
although the apparent citation of euclid by archimedes has been judged to be an interpolation by later editors of his works , it is still believed that euclid wrote his works before archimedes wrote his .
proclus later retells a story that , when ptolemy i asked if there was a shorter path to learning geometry than euclid's " elements " , " euclid replied there is no royal road to geometry .
" this anecdote is questionable since it is similar to a story told about menaechmus and alexander the great .
euclid died c .
*num* bc , presumably in alexandria .
in the only other key reference to euclid , pappus of alexandria ( c .
*num* ad ) briefly mentioned that apollonius " spent a very long time with the pupils of euclid at alexandria , and it was thus that he acquired such a scientific habit of thought " c .
247–222 bc .
because the lack of biographical information is unusual for the period ( extensive biographies being available for most significant greek mathematicians several centuries before and after euclid ) , some researchers have proposed that euclid was not a historical personage , and that his works were written by a team of mathematicians who took the name euclid from euclid of megara ( à la bourbaki ) .
however , this hypothesis is not well accepted by scholars and there is little evidence in its favor .
although many of the results in " elements " originated with earlier mathematicians , one of euclid's accomplishments was to present them in a single , logically coherent framework , making it easy to use and easy to reference , including a system of rigorous mathematical proofs that remains the basis of mathematics *num* centuries later .
there is no mention of euclid in the earliest remaining copies of the " elements " , and most of the copies say they are " from the edition of theon " or the " lectures of theon " , while the text considered to be primary , held by the vatican , mentions no author .
the only reference that historians rely on of euclid having written the " elements " was from proclus , who briefly in his " commentary on the elements " ascribes euclid as its author .
although best known for its geometric results , the " elements " also includes number theory .
it considers the connection between perfect numbers and mersenne primes ( known as the euclid–euler theorem ) , the infinitude of prime numbers , euclid's lemma on factorization ( which leads to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic on uniqueness of prime factorizations ) , and the euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers .
the geometrical system described in the " elements " was long known simply as " geometry " , and was considered to be the only geometry possible .
today , however , that system is often referred to as " euclidean geometry " to distinguish it from other so-called " non-euclidean geometries " that mathematicians discovered in the *ord* century .
the papyrus oxyrhynchus *num* ( p .
oxy .
*num* ) is a fragment of the second book of the " elements " of euclid , unearthed by grenfell and hunt *num* in oxyrhynchus .
more recent scholarship suggests a date of 75–125 ad .
the classic translation of t .
l .
heath , reads : in addition to the " elements " , at least five works of euclid have survived to the present day .
they follow the same logical structure as " elements " , with definitions and proved propositions .
other works are credibly attributed to euclid , but have been lost .
the european space agency's ( esa ) euclid spacecraft was named in his honor .
emperor kanmu kanmu's personal name ( " imina " ) was .
he was the eldest son of prince shirakabe ( later known as emperor kōnin ) , and was born prior to shirakabe's ascension to the throne .
according to the , yamabe's mother , yamato no niigasa ( later called takano no niigasa ) , was a *ord* generation descendant of muryeong of baekje .
after his father became emperor , kanmu's half-brother , prince osabe was appointed to the rank of crown prince .
his mother was princess inoe , a daughter of emperor shōmu ; but instead of osabe , it was kanmu who was later named to succeed their father .
after inoe and prince osabe were confined and then died in *num* , osabe's sister – kanmu's half-sister princess sakahito – became kanmu's wife .
later , when he ascended to the throne in *num* , kanmu appointed his young brother , prince sawara , whose mother was takano no niigasa , as crown prince .
hikami no kawatsugu , a son of emperor tenmu's grandson prince shioyaki and shōmu's daughter fuwa , attempted to carry out a coup d'état in *num* , but it failed and kawatsugu and his mother were sent into exile .
in *num* sawara was expelled and died in exile .
kanmu had *num* empresses and consorts , and *num* imperial sons and daughters .
among them , three sons would eventually ascend to the imperial throne : emperor heizei , emperor saga and emperor junna .
some of his descendants ( known as the " kanmu taira " or " kanmu heishi " ) took the taira hereditary clan title , and in later generations became prominent warriors .
examples include taira no masakado , taira no kiyomori , and ( with a further surname expansion ) the hōjō clan .
the " waka " poet ariwara no narihira was one of his grandsons .
kanmu is traditionally venerated at his tomb ; the imperial household agency designates , in fushimi-ku , kyoto , as the location of kanmu's mausoleum .
kanmu was an active emperor who attempted to consolidate government hierarchies and functions .
kanmu appointed sakanoue no tamuramaro ( 758–811 ) to lead a military expedition against the emishi .
the years of kanmu's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name ( " nengō " ) .
earlier imperial sponsorship of buddhism , beginning with prince shōtoku ( 574–622 ) , had led to a general politicization of the clergy , along with an increase in intrigue and corruption .
in *num* kanmu shifted his capital from nara to nagaoka-kyō in a move that was said to be designed to edge the powerful nara buddhist establishments out of state politics—while the capital moved , the major buddhist temples , and their officials , stayed put .
indeed , there was a steady stream of edicts issued from *num* right through the period of kūkai's studies which , for instance , sought to limit the number of buddhist priests , and the building of temples .
however the move was to prove disastrous and was followed by a series of natural disasters including the flooding of half the city .
in *num* the principal architect of the new capital , and royal favourite , fujiwara no tanetsugu , was assassinated .
meanwhile , kanmu's armies were pushing back the boundaries of his empire .
this led to an uprising , and in *num* a substantial defeat for kanmu's troops .
also in *num* there was a severe drought and famine—the streets of the capital were clogged with the sick , and people avoiding being drafted into the military , or into forced labour .
many disguised themselves as buddhist priests for the same reason .
then in *num* kanmu suddenly shifted the capital again , this time to heian-kyō , which is modern day kyoto .
the new capital was started early the previous year , but the change was abrupt and led to even more confusion amongst the populace .
politically kanmu shored up his rule by changing the syllabus of the university .
confucian ideology still provided the " raison d'être " for the imperial government .
in *num* kanmu authorised the teaching of a new course based on the " spring and autumn annals " based on two newly imported commentaries : " kung-yang " and " ku-liang " .
these commentaries used political rhetoric to promote a state in which the emperor , as " son of heaven , " should extend his sphere of influence to barbarous lands , thereby gladdening the people .
in *num* the two commentaries became required reading at the government university .
kanmu also sponsored the travels of the monks saichō and kūkai to china , from where they returned to found the japanese branches of , respectively , tendai and shingon buddhism .
is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the emperor of japan in pre-meiji eras .
in general , this elite group included only three to four men at a time .
these were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career .
during kanmu's reign , this apex of the " daijō-kan included : when the daughter of a " chūnagon " became the favored consort of the crown prince ate ( later known as heizei"-tennō " ) , her father's power and position in court was affected .
kanmu disapproved of , daughter of fujiwara no tadanushi ; and kanmu had her removed from his son's household .
emperor kanmu's imperial family included *num* children .

according to the " shoku nihongi " , emperor kanmu's mother , takano no niigasa , is a descendant of prince junda , son of muryeong , who died in japan in *num* ( " nihon shoki " , chapter *num* ) .
gough whitlam edward gough whitlam ( ; *num* july *num* october *num* ) was the *ord* prime minister of australia , serving from *num* to *num* .
the leader of the labor party from *num* to *num* , whitlam led his party to power for the first time in *num* years at the *num* election .
he won the *num* election before being controversially dismissed by the governor-general of australia , sir john kerr , at the climax of the *num* australian constitutional crisis .
whitlam remains the only australian prime minister to have his commission terminated in that manner .
whitlam served as an air navigator in the royal australian air force for four years during world war ii , and worked as a barrister following the war .
he was first elected to parliament in *num* , representing werriwa in the house of representatives .
whitlam became deputy leader of the labor party in *num* , and in *num* , after the retirement of arthur calwell , was elected leader and became the leader of the opposition .
after narrowly losing the *num* election , whitlam led labor to victory at the *num* election after *num* years of continuous liberal-country coalition government .
the whitlam government implemented a large number of new programs and policy changes , including the termination of military conscription , institution of universal health care and free university education , and the implementation of legal aid programs .
with the opposition-controlled senate delaying passage of bills , whitlam called a double dissolution election in *num* in which he won a majority in the house of representatives , albeit a slightly reduced one , and picked up three senate seats .
the whitlam government then instituted the first and only joint sitting enabled under s .
*num* of the constitution as part of the double dissolution process .
despite the government's second election victory , the opposition , reacting to government scandals and a flagging economy suffering from the *num* oil crisis and the 1973–75 recession , continued to obstruct the government's program in the senate .
in late *num* , the opposition senators refused to allow a vote on the government's appropriation bills , returning them to the house of representatives with a demand that the government go to an election , thus denying the government supply .
whitlam refused to back down , arguing that his government , which held a clear majority in the house of representatives , was being held to ransom by the senate .
the crisis ended on *num* november , when whitlam arrived at a pre-arranged meeting with the governor-general , sir john kerr , at government house in order to call a half-senate election .
kerr dismissed him and commissioned the opposition leader , malcolm fraser , as prime minister .
labor lost the subsequent election by a landslide .
whitlam stepped down after losing again at the *num* election , and retired from parliament in *num* .
upon the election of the hawke government in *num* , he was appointed as ambassador to unesco , a position he filled with distinction , and was elected a member of the unesco executive board .
he remained active into his nineties .
the propriety and circumstances of his dismissal and the legacy of his government have been frequently debated in the decades after he left office .
edward gough whitlam was born on *num* july *num* at the family home ' ngara ' , *num* rowland street , kew , a suburb of melbourne , the elder of two children ( his sister , freda , was born four years after him ) , to martha ( née maddocks ) and fred whitlam .
his father was a federal public servant who later served as commonwealth crown solicitor , and whitlam senior's involvement in human rights issues was a powerful influence on his son .
since the boy's maternal grandfather was also named edward , from early childhood he was called by his middle name , gough , which in turn had come from his paternal grandfather , who had been named after the british soldier field-marshal hugh gough , *ord* viscount gough .
in *num* , fred whitlam was promoted to deputy crown solicitor and transferred to sydney .
the family lived first in the north shore suburb of mosman and then in turramurra .
at age six , gough began his education at chatswood church of england girls ' school ( early primary schooling at a girls ' school was not unusual for small boys at the time ) .
after a year there , he attended mowbray house school and knox grammar school , in the suburbs of sydney .
fred whitlam was promoted again in *num* , this time to assistant crown solicitor .
the position was located in the new national capital of canberra , and the whitlam family moved there .
gough whitlam remains the only prime minister to have spent his formative years in canberra .
at the time , conditions remained primitive in what was dubbed " the bush capital " and " the land of the blowflies " .
gough attended the government telopea park school .
in *num* , whitlam's father transferred him to canberra grammar school where , at the speech day ceremony that year , he was awarded a prize by the governor-general , sir isaac isaacs .
whitlam enrolled at st paul's college at the university of sydney at the age of *num* .
he earned his first wages by appearing , with several other " paulines " , in a cabaret scene in the film " the broken melody"—the students were chosen because st paul's requires formal wear at dinner , and they could therefore supply their own costumes .
after receiving a bachelor of arts degree with second-class honours in classics , whitlam remained at st paul's to begin his law studies .
he had originally contemplated an academic career , but his lacklustre marks made that unlikely .
dropping out of greek classes , he professed himself unable to care for the " dry as dust " lectures of enoch powell .
soon after the outbreak of world war ii in *num* , whitlam enlisted in the sydney university regiment , part of the militia .
in late *num* , following the japanese attack on pearl harbor , and with a year remaining in his legal studies , he volunteered for the royal australian air force ( raaf ) .
in *num* , while awaiting entry into the service , whitlam met and married margaret elaine dovey , who had swum for australia in the *num* british empire games and was the daughter of barrister and future new south wales supreme court judge bill dovey .
he entered the raaf on *num* june *num* .
whitlam trained as a navigator and bomb aimer , before serving with no .
*num* squadron raaf , based mainly on the gove peninsula , northern territory , flying lockheed ventura bombers .
he reached the rank of flight lieutenant .
while in the service , he began his political activities , distributing literature for the australian labor party during the *num* federal election and urging the passage of the " fourteen powers " referendum of *num* , which would have expanded the powers of the federal government .
although the party was victorious , the referendum it advocated was defeated .
in *num* , whitlam said of the referendum defeat , " my hopes were dashed by the outcome and from that moment i determined to do all i could do to modernise the australian constitution .
" while still in uniform , whitlam joined the alp in sydney in *num* .
he was discharged from the raaf on *num* october *num* , and continued to use air force log books to record all of the flights he took until *num* .
whitlam completed his studies after the war , obtained his bachelor of laws , and was admitted to the federal and new south wales bars in *num* .
with his war service loan , whitlam built a house in seaside cronulla .
he also bought the block of land next door , using the prize money ( £1 , *num* in security bonds ) he received for winning the australian national quiz championship in *num* and *num* ( he was runner-up in *num* ) .
he sought to make a career in the alp there , but local labor supporters were sceptical of whitlam's loyalties , given his privileged background .
in the postwar years , he practised law , concentrating on landlord / tenant matters , and sought to build his bona fides in the party .
he ran twice—unsuccessfully—for the local council , once ( also unsuccessfully ) for the new south wales legislative assembly , and campaigned for other candidates .
in *num* , bert lazzarini , the labor member for the federal electorate of werriwa , announced that he would stand down at the next election .
whitlam won the preselection as alp candidate .
lazzarini died in *num* before completing his term and whitlam was elected to the house of representatives in the ensuing by-election on *num* november *num* .
whitlam trebled lazzarini's majority in a *num* per cent swing to labor .
whitlam joined the alp minority in the house of representatives .
his maiden speech provoked an interruption by a future prime minister , john mcewen , who was then told by the speaker that maiden speeches are traditionally heard in silence .
whitlam responded to mcewen by stating that benjamin disraeli had been heckled in his maiden speech and had responded , " the time will come when you shall hear me .
" he told mcewen , " the time will come when you may interrupt me .
" according to early whitlam biographers laurie oakes and david solomon , this cool response put the coalition government on notice that the new member for werriwa would be a force to be reckoned with .
in the rough and tumble debate in the house of representatives , whitlam called fellow mhr bill bourke " this grizzling quisling " , garfield barwick ( who would , as high court chief justice , play a role in whitlam's downfall ) a " bumptious bastard " , and stated that bill wentworth exhibited a " hereditary streak of insanity " .
after calling future prime minister william mcmahon a " quean " , he apologised .
the alp had been out of office since the chifley government's defeat in *num* and , since *num* , had been under the leadership of bert evatt , whom whitlam greatly admired .
in *num* , the alp seemed likely to return to power .
the prime minister , robert menzies , adroitly used the defection of a soviet official to his advantage , and his coalition of the liberal and country parties was returned in the *num* election with a seven-seat majority .
after the election , evatt attempted to purge the party of industrial groupers , who had long dissented from party policy , and who were predominantly catholic and anti-communist .
the ensuing division in the alp , which came to be known as " the split " , sparked the birth of the democratic labor party ( dlp ) .
it was a conflict that helped to keep labor out of power for a generation , since dlp supporters chose the liberal party in preferential voting .
whitlam supported evatt throughout this period .
in *num* , a redistribution divided whitlam's electorate of werriwa in two , with his cronulla home located in the new electorate of hughes .
although whitlam would have received alp support in either division , he chose to continue standing for werriwa and moved from cronulla to cabramatta .
this meant even longer journeys for his older children to attend school , since neither electorate had a high school at the time , and they attended school in sydney .
whitlam was appointed to the parliamentary joint committee on constitutional review in *num* .
biographer jenny hocking calls his service on the committee , which included members from all parties in both chambers of parliament , one of the " great influences in his political development " .
according to hocking , service on the committee caused whitlam to focus not on internal conflicts consuming the alp , but on labor goals which were possible and worthwhile in the constitutional framework .
many labor goals , such as nationalisation , ran contrary to the constitution .
whitlam came to believe that the constitution—and especially section *num* ( which allowed the federal government to make grants to the states ) —could be used to advance a worthwhile labor programme .
by the late 1950s whitlam was seen as a leadership contender once the existing labor leaders exited the scene .
most of the party's major figures , including evatt , deputy leader arthur calwell , eddie ward , and reg pollard , were in their sixties , twenty years older than whitlam .
in *num* , after losing three elections , evatt resigned and was replaced by calwell , with whitlam defeating ward for deputy leader .
calwell came within a handful of votes of winning the cliffhanger *num* election .
he had not wanted whitlam as deputy leader , and believed labor would have won if ward had been in the position .
soon after the *num* election , events began to turn against labor .
when president sukarno of indonesia announced that he intended to take over west new guinea as the colonial dutch departed , calwell responded by declaring that indonesia must be stopped by force .
calwell's statement was called " crazy and irresponsible " by prime minister menzies , and the incident reduced public support for the alp .
at that time , the federal conference of the labor party , which dictated policy to parliamentary members , consisted of six members from each state , but not calwell or whitlam .
in early *num* a special conference met in a canberra hotel to determine labor policy regarding a proposed us base in northern australia ; calwell and whitlam were photographed by " the daily telegraph " peering in through the doors , waiting for the verdict .
in an accompanying story , alan reid of the " telegraph " wrote that labor was ruled by " *num* faceless men " .
the liberals seized on it , issuing a leaflet called " mr calwell and the faceless men " which accused calwell and whitlam of taking direction from " *num* unknown men , not elected to parliament nor responsible to the people .
" menzies manipulated the opposition on issues that bitterly divided it , such as direct aid to the states for private schools , and the proposed base .
he called an early election for november *num* , standing in support of those two issues .
the prime minister performed better than calwell on television and received an unexpected boost after the assassination of us president john f .
kennedy .
as a result , the coalition easily defeated labor on a 10-seat swing .
whitlam had hoped calwell would step down after *num* , but he remained , reasoning that evatt had been given three opportunities to win , and that he should be allowed a third try .
calwell dismissed proposals that the alp leader and deputy leader should be entitled to membership of the party's conference ( or on its governing 12-person federal executive , which had two representatives from each state ) , and instead ran successfully for one of the conference's victoria seats .
labor did badly in a *num* by-election in the tasmanian electorate of denison , and lost seats in the *num* half-senate election .
the party was also defeated in the state elections in the most populous state , new south wales , surrendering control of the state government for the first time since *num* .
whitlam's relationship with calwell , never good , deteriorated further after publication of a *num* article in " the australian " .
the article reported off-the-record comments whitlam had made that his leader was " too old and weak " to win office , and that the party might be gravely damaged by an " old-fashioned " 70-year-old calwell seeking his first term as prime minister .
later that year , at whitlam's urging , and over calwell's objection , the biennial party conference made major changes to the party's platform : deleting support for the white australia policy and making the alp's leader and deputy leader " ex officio " members of the conference and executive , along with the party's leader and deputy leader in the senate .
as whitlam considered the senate unrepresentative , he opposed the admission of its alp leaders to the party's governing bodies .
menzies retired in january *num* , and was succeeded as prime minister by the new liberal party leader , harold holt .
after years of politics being dominated by the elderly menzies and calwell , the younger holt was seen as a breath of fresh air , and attracted public interest and support in the run-up to the november election .
in early *num* , the 36-member conference , with calwell's assent , banned any alp parliamentarian from supporting federal assistance to the states for spending on both government and private schools , commonly called " state aid " .
whitlam broke with the party on the issue , and was charged with gross disloyalty by the executive , an offence which carried the penalty of expulsion from the party .
before the matter could be heard , whitlam left for queensland , where he campaigned intensively for the alp candidate rex patterson in the dawson by-election .
the alp won , dealing the government its first by-election defeat since *num* .
whitlam survived the expulsion vote by a margin of only two , gaining both queensland votes .
at the end of april , whitlam challenged calwell for the leadership ; though calwell received two-thirds of the vote , he announced that if the party lost the upcoming election , he would not stand again for the leadership .
holt called an election for november *num* , in which australia's involvement in the vietnam war was a major issue .
calwell called for an " immediate and unconditional withdrawal " of australian troops from vietnam .
whitlam , however , said that this would deprive australia of any voice in a settlement , and that regular troops , rather than conscripts , should remain under some circumstances .
calwell considered whitlam's remark disastrous , disputing the party line just five days before the election .
the alp suffered a crushing defeat ; the party was reduced to *num* seats in the house of representatives .
shortly after the election , whitlam faced another expulsion vote for his stance on vietnam , and survived .
true to his word , calwell resigned two months after the election .
at the caucus meeting on *num* february *num* , whitlam was elected party leader , defeating leading left-wing candidate dr jim cairns .
whitlam believed the labor party had little chance of being elected unless it could expand its appeal from the traditional working-class base to include the suburban middle class .
he sought to shift control of the alp from union officials to the parliamentary party , and hoped that even rank-and-file party members could be given a voice in the conference .
in *num* , controversy erupted within the party when the executive refused to seat new tasmanian delegate brian harradine , a whitlam supporter who was considered a right-wing extremist .
whitlam resigned the leadership , demanding a vote of confidence from caucus .
he defeated cairns for the leadership in an unexpectedly close 38–32 vote .
despite the vote , the executive refused to seat harradine .
with the alp's governing bodies unwilling to reform themselves , whitlam worked to build support for change among ordinary party members .
he was successful in reducing union influence in the party , though he was never able to give the rank and file a direct vote in selecting the executive .
the victoria branch of the party had long been a problem ; its executive was far to the left of the rest of the alp , and had little electoral success .
whitlam was able to reconstruct the victoria party organisation against the will of its leaders , and the reconstituted state party proved essential to victory in the *num* election .
by the time of the *num* party conference , whitlam had gained considerable control over the alp .
that conference passed *num* resolutions , including broad changes to party policy and procedures .
it called for the establishment of an australian schools commission to consider the proper level of state aid for schools and universities , recognition of aboriginal land claims , and expanded party policy on universal health care .
the conference also called for increased federal involvement in urban planning , and would form the basis of " the program " of modern socialism which whitlam and the alp would present to the voters in *num* .
since *num* , labor had called for the abolition of the existing australian constitution , with the vesting of all political power in parliament , a plan which would turn the states into powerless geographic regions .
beginning in *num* , whitlam had sought to change this goal .
he finally succeeded at the *num* alp conference in launceston , tasmania , which called for parliament to receive " such plenary powers as are necessary and desirable " to achieve the alp's goals in domestic and international affairs .
labor also pledged to abolish the senate ; this goal would not be erased from the party platform until *num* , after whitlam had stepped down as leader .
soon after taking the leadership , whitlam reorganised the alp caucus , assigning portfolios and turning the labor frontbench into a shadow cabinet .
while the liberal-country coalition had a huge majority in the house of representatives , whitlam energised the party by campaigning intensively to win two by-elections in *num* : first in corio in victoria , and later that year in capricornia ( queensland ) .
the november half-senate election saw a moderate swing to labor and against the coalition , compared with the general election the previous year .
these federal victories , in which both whitlam and holt campaigned , helped give whitlam the leverage he needed to carry out party reforms .
at the end of *num* , holt vanished while swimming in rough seas near melbourne ; his body was never recovered .
john mcewen , as leader of the junior coalition partner , the country party , took over as prime minister for three weeks until the liberals could elect a new leader .
senator john gorton won the vote and became prime minister .
the leadership campaign was conducted mostly by television , and gorton appeared to have the visual appeal needed to keep whitlam out of office .
gorton resigned his seat in the senate , and in february *num* won the by-election for holt's seat of higgins in victoria .
for the remainder of the year , gorton appeared to have the better of whitlam in the house of representatives .
in his chronicle of the whitlam years , however , speechwriter graham freudenberg asserts that gorton's erratic behaviour , whitlam's strengthening of his party , and events outside australia ( such as the vietnam war ) ate away at liberal dominance .
gorton called an election for october *num* .
whitlam and the alp , with little internal dissension , stood on a platform calling for domestic reform , an end to conscription , and the withdrawal of australian troops from vietnam by *num* july *num* .
whitlam knew that , given the alp's poor position after the *num* election , victory was unlikely .
nevertheless , whitlam scored an 18-seat swing , labor's best performance since losing government in *num* .
it also scored a *num* .
*num* percent two-party swing , the largest to not result in a change of government .
although the coalition was returned for an eighth term in government , it was with a slim majority of three seats , down from *num* after the writs were dropped .
labor actually won a bare majority of the two-party vote ; only dlp preferences in four melbourne-area seats kept whitlam from becoming prime minister .
the *num* half-senate election brought little change to coalition control , but the liberal vote fell for the first time below *num* per cent , representing a severe threat to gorton's leadership .
in march *num* , the resentment against gorton came to a head when a confidence vote in the liberal caucus resulted in a tie .
declaring that this was a sign he no longer had the confidence of the party , gorton resigned , and william mcmahon was elected his successor .
with the liberals in turmoil , whitlam and the alp sought to gain public trust as a credible government-in-waiting .
the party's actions , such as its abandonment of the white australia policy , gained favourable media attention .
the labor leader flew to papua new guinea and pledged himself to the independence of what was then an australian possession .
in *num* , whitlam flew to beijing and met with chinese officials , including zhou enlai .
mcmahon attacked whitlam for the visit and claimed that the chinese had manipulated him .
this attack backfired when us president richard nixon announced that he would visit china the following year .
his national security advisor , henry kissinger , visited beijing between 9–11 july ( less than a week after whitlam's visit of 4–6 july ) , and ( unknown to whitlam ) some of kissinger's staff had actually been in beijing preparing for kissinger's visit at the same time as the labor delegation .
according to whitlam biographer jenny hocking , the incident transformed whitlam into an international statesman , while mcmahon was seen as reacting defensively to whitlam's foreign policy ventures .
other errors by mcmahon , such as a confused ad-lib speech while visiting washington , and a statement to indonesia's president suharto that australia was a " west european nation " , also damaged the government .
by early *num* , labor had established a clear lead in the polls ; indeed , for the first time since *num* its support was greater than the combined vote for the coalition and dlp .
unemployment was at a ten-year peak , rising to *num* .
*num* percent in august ( though the unemployment rate was calculated differently compared to the present , and did not include thousands of rural workers on commonwealth-financed relief work ) .
inflation was also at its highest rate since the early 1950s .
the government recovered slightly in the august budget session of parliament , proposing income tax cuts and increased spending .
the labor strategy for the run-up to the election was to sit back and allow the coalition to make mistakes .
whitlam controversially stated in march that " draft-dodging is not a crime " and that he would be open to a revaluation of the australian dollar .
with the coalition sinking in the polls and his own personal approval ratings down as low as *num* percent , mcmahon waited as long as he could , finally calling an election for the house of representatives for *num* december .
whitlam noted that the polling day was the anniversary of the battle of austerlitz – at which another " ramshackle , reactionary coalition " had been given a " crushing defeat " .
labor campaigned under the slogan " it's time " , an echo of menzies ' successful *num* slogan , " it's time for a change " .
surveys showed that even liberal voters approved of the labor slogan .
whitlam pledged an end to conscription and the release of individuals who had refused the draft ; an income tax surcharge to pay for universal health insurance ; free dental care for students ; and renovation of aging urban infrastructure .
the party pledged to eliminate university tuition fees and establish a schools commission to evaluate educational needs .
the party benefited from the support of the proprietor of news limited , rupert murdoch , who preferred whitlam over mcmahon .
labor was so dominant in the campaign that some of whitlam's advisers urged him to stop joking about mcmahon ; people were feeling sorry for him .
the election saw the alp increase its tally by *num* seats , mostly in suburban sydney and melbourne , for a majority of nine in the house of representatives .
the alp gained little beyond the suburban belts , however , losing a seat in south australia and two in western australia .
whitlam took office with a majority in the house of representatives , but without control of the senate ( elected in the *num* and *num* half-elections ) .
the senate at that time consisted of ten members from each of the six states , elected by proportional representation .
historically , when labor won government , the parliamentary caucus chose the ministers , with the party leader only having the power to assign portfolios .
however , the new labor caucus would not meet until after the final results came in on *num* december .
in the meantime , mcmahon would remain caretaker prime minister .
whitlam , however , was unwilling to wait that long .
on *num* december , with labor's win beyond doubt even though counting was still underway , whitlam had the governor-general , sir paul hasluck , swear him in as prime minister and labor's deputy leader , lance barnard , as deputy prime minister .
the two men held *num* portfolios during the two weeks before a full cabinet could be determined .
during the two weeks the so-called " duumvirate " held office , whitlam sought to fulfill those campaign promises that did not require legislation .
whitlam ordered negotiations to establish full relations with the people's republic of china , and broke those with taiwan .
legislation allowed the defence minister to grant exemptions from conscription .
barnard held this office , and exempted everyone .
seven men were at that time incarcerated for refusing conscription ; whitlam arranged for their liberation .
the whitlam government in its first days reopened the equal pay case pending before the commonwealth conciliation and arbitration commission , and appointed a woman , elizabeth evatt , to the commission .
whitlam and barnard eliminated sales tax on contraceptive pills , announced major grants for the arts , and appointed an interim schools commission .
the duumvirate barred racially discriminatory sports teams from australia , and instructed the australian delegation at the united nations to vote in favour of sanctions on apartheid south africa and rhodesia .
it also ordered the australian army training team home from vietnam , ending australia's involvement in the war ; most troops ( including all conscripts ) had been withdrawn by mcmahon .
according to whitlam speechwriter graham freudenberg , the duumvirate was a success , as it showed that the labor government could manipulate the machinery of government , despite almost a quarter-century in opposition .
however , freudenberg noted that the rapid pace and public excitement caused by the duumvirate's actions caused the opposition to be wary of giving labor too easy a time , and gave rise to one post-mortem assessment of the whitlam government : " we did too much too soon .
" the mcmahon government had consisted of *num* ministers , twelve of whom comprised the cabinet .
in the run-up to the election , the labor caucus had decided that should the party take power , all *num* ministers were to be cabinet members .
intense canvassing took place amongst alp parliamentarians as the duumvirate did its work , and on *num* december the caucus elected the cabinet .
the results were generally acceptable to whitlam , and within three hours , he had announced the portfolios of the cabinet members .
to give himself greater control over the cabinet , in january *num* whitlam established five cabinet committees ( with the members appointed by himself , not the caucus ) and took full control of the cabinet agenda .
gough whitlam , prime minister for fewer than three years between *num* and *num* , pushed through a raft of reforms that radically changed australia's economic , legal and cultural landscape .
the whitlam government abolished the death penalty for federal crimes .
legal aid was established , with offices in each state capital .
it abolished university fees , and established the schools commission to allocate funds to schools .
whitlam founded the department of urban development and , having lived in developing cabramatta , most of which lacked sewage facilities , set a goal to leave no urban home unsewered .
the whitlam government gave grants directly to local government units for urban renewal , flood prevention , and the promotion of tourism .
other federal grants financed highways linking the state capitals , and paid for standard-gauge rail lines between the states .
the government attempted to set up a new city at albury–wodonga on the victoria–new south wales border .
the process was started for " advance australia fair " to become the country's national anthem in place of " god save the queen " .
the order of australia replaced the british honours system in early *num* .
in *num* , the national gallery of australia , then called the australian national gallery , bought the painting " blue poles " by contemporary artist jackson pollock for us$2 million ( a$1 .
*num* million at the time of payment ) – about a third of its annual budget .
this required whitlam's personal permission , which he gave on the condition the price was publicized .
the purchase created a political and media scandal , and was said to symbolise , alternatively , whitlam's foresight and vision or his profligate spending .
whitlam travelled extensively as prime minister , and was the first australian prime minister to visit china while in office .
he was criticised for making this visit , especially after cyclone tracy struck darwin ; he interrupted an extensive tour of europe for *num* hours ( deemed too brief a period by many ) to view the devastation .
in february *num* , the attorney general , senator lionel murphy , led a police raid on the melbourne office of the australian security intelligence organisation , which was under his ministerial responsibility .
murphy believed that asio might have files relating to threats against yugoslav prime minister džemal bijedić , who was about to visit australia , and feared asio might conceal or destroy them .
the opposition attacked the government over the raid , terming murphy a " loose cannon " .
a senate investigation of the incident was cut short when parliament was dissolved in *num* .
according to journalist and author wallace brown , the controversy over the raid continued to dog the whitlam government throughout its term , because the incident was " so silly " .
from the start of the whitlam government , the opposition , led by billy snedden ( who replaced mcmahon as liberal leader in december *num* ) sought to use control of the senate to baulk whitlam .
it did not seek to block all government legislation ; the coalition senators , led by senate liberal leader reg withers , sought to block government legislation only when the obstruction would advance the opposition's agenda .
the whitlam government also had troubles in relations with the states .
new south wales refused the government's request that it close the rhodesian information centre in sydney .
the queensland premier , joh bjelke-petersen refused to consider any adjustment in queensland's border with papua new guinea , which , due to the state's ownership of islands in the torres strait , came within half a kilometre ( about one-third of a mile ) of the papuan mainland .
liberal state governments in new south wales and victoria were re-elected by large margins in *num* .
whitlam and his majority in the house of representatives proposed a constitutional referendum in december *num* , transferring control of wages and prices from the states to the federal government .
the two propositions failed to attract a majority of voters in any state , and were rejected by over *num* , *num* votes nationwide .
by early *num* , the senate had rejected nineteen government bills , ten of them twice .
with a half-senate election due by mid-year , whitlam looked for ways to shore up support in that body .
queensland senator and former dlp leader vince gair signalled his willingness to leave the senate for a diplomatic post .
gair's term would not expire until the following half-senate election ( or upon a double dissolution election ) .
with five queensland seats at stake in the half-senate election , the alp would probably win only two , but if six ( including gair's ) were at stake , the party likely would win a third .
possible control of the senate was therefore at stake ; whitlam agreed to gair's request and had governor-general sir paul hasluck appoint him ambassador to ireland .
word leaked of gair's pending resignation , and whitlam's opponents attempted to counteract his manoeuvre .
on what became known as the " night of the long prawns " , country party members secreted gair at a small party in a legislative office as the alp searched for him to secure his written resignation .
as gair enjoyed beer and prawns , bjelke-petersen advised the queensland governor , sir colin hannah , to issue writs for only the usual five vacancies , since gair's seat was not yet vacant , effectively countering whitlam's plan .
the senate had refused to pass six bills after their twice being passed by the house of representatives .
with the opposition threatening to disrupt money supply to government , whitlam used the senate's recalcitrance to trigger a double dissolution election , holding it instead of the half-senate election .
after a campaign featuring the labor slogan " give gough a fair go " , the whitlam government was returned , with its majority in the house of representatives cut from seven to five and increasing its senate seats by three .
it was only the second time since federation that a labor government had been elected to a second full term .
the government and the opposition each had *num* senators with two seats held by independents .
the deadlock over the twice-rejected bills was broken , uniquely in australian history , with a special joint sitting of the two houses of parliament under section *num* of the constitution .
this session , authorised by the new governor-general , sir john kerr , passed bills providing for universal health insurance ( known then as medibank , today as medicare ) and providing the northern territory and australian capital territory with representation in the senate , effective at the next election .
by mid-1974 , australia was in an economic slump , suffering from the *num* oil crisis and 1973–75 recession .
the *num* oil crisis had caused prices to spike and , according to government figures , inflation topped *num* percent for over a year between *num* and *num* .
part of the inflation was due to whitlam's desire to increase wages and conditions of the commonwealth public service as a pacesetter for the private sector .
the whitlam government had cut tariffs by *num* percent in *num* ; *num* saw an increase in imports of *num* percent and a $1 .
*num* billion increase in the trade deficit .
primary producers of commodities such as beef were caught in a credit squeeze as short-term rates rose to extremely high levels .
unemployment also rose significantly .
unease within the alp led to barnard's defeat when jim cairns challenged him for his deputy leadership .
whitlam gave little help to his embattled deputy , who had formed the other half of the duumvirate .
despite these economic indicators , the budget presented in august *num* saw large increases in spending , especially in education .
treasury officials had advised a series of tax and fee increases , ranging from excise taxes to the cost of posting a letter ; their advice was mostly rejected by cabinet .
the budget was unsuccessful in dealing with the inflation and unemployment , and whitlam introduced large tax cuts in november .
he also announced additional spending to help the private sector .
beginning in october *num* , the whitlam government sought overseas loans to finance its development plans , with the newly enriched oil nations a likely target .
whitlam attempted to secure financing before informing the loan council ( which included state officials hostile to whitlam ) , and his government empowered pakistani financier tirath khemlani as an intermediary in the hope of securing us$4 billion in loans .
while the loans affair never resulted in an actual loan , according to author and whitlam speechwriter graham freudenberg , " the only cost involved was the cost to the reputation of the government .
that cost was to be immense—it was government itself .
" whitlam appointed senator murphy to the high court , even though murphy's senate seat would not be up for election if a half-senate election were held .
labor then held three of the five short-term new south wales senate seats .
under proportional representation , labor could hold its three short-term seats in the next half-senate election but , if murphy's seat were also contested , labor was unlikely to win four out of six .
thus , a murphy appointment meant the almost certain loss of a seat in the closely divided senate at the next election .
whitlam appointed murphy anyway .
by convention , senators appointed by the state legislature to fill casual vacancies were from the same political party as the former senator .
the new south wales premier , tom lewis felt that this convention only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill-health , and arranged for the legislature to elect cleaver bunton , former mayor of albury and an independent .
by march *num* , many liberal parliamentarians felt that snedden was doing an inadequate job as leader of the opposition , and that whitlam was dominating him in the house of representatives .
malcolm fraser challenged snedden for the leadership , and defeated him on *num* march .
soon after fraser's accession , controversy arose over the whitlam government's actions in trying to restart peace talks in vietnam .
as the north prepared to end the civil war , whitlam sent cables to both vietnamese governments , telling parliament that both cables were substantially the same .
the opposition contended he had misled parliament , and a motion to censure whitlam was defeated along party lines .
the opposition also attacked whitlam for not allowing enough south vietnamese refugees into australia , with fraser calling for the entry of *num* , *num* .
freudenberg alleges that *num* , *num* vietnamese refugees entered australia in the final eight months of the whitlam government , and only *num* in *num* under fraser .
however , by *num* , australia had accepted over five thousand refugees .
as the political situation deteriorated , whitlam and his government continued to enact legislation : the family law act *num* provided for no-fault divorce while the racial discrimination act *num* caused australia to ratify the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination that australia had signed under holt , but which had never been ratified .
in august *num* , whitlam gave the gurindji people of the northern territory title deeds to part of their traditional lands , beginning the process of aboriginal land reform .
the next month , australia granted independence to papua new guinea .
following the *num* carnation revolution , portugal began a process of decolonisation and began a withdrawal from portuguese timor ( later east timor ) .
australians had long taken an interest in the colony ; the nation had sent troops to the region during world war ii , and many east timorese had fought the japanese as guerrillas .
in september *num* , whitlam met with president suharto in indonesia and indicated that he would support indonesia if it annexed east timor .
at the height of the cold war , and in the context of the american retreat from indo-china , he felt that incorporation of east timor into indonesia would enhance the stability of the region , and reduce the risk of the east timorese fretilin movement , which many feared was communist , coming to power .
whitlam had offered barnard a diplomatic post ; in early *num* barnard agreed to this , triggering a by-election in his tasmanian electorate of bass .
the election on *num* june proved a disaster for labor , which lost the seat with a swing against it of *num* percent .
the next week , whitlam fired barnard's successor as deputy prime minister , cairns , who had misled parliament regarding the loans affair amid controversy about his relationship with his office manager , junie morosi .
at the time of cairns's dismissal , one senate seat was vacant , following the death on *num* june of queensland alp senator bertie milliner .
the state labor party nominated mal colston , resulting in a deadlock .
the unicameral queensland legislature twice voted against colston , and the party refused to submit any alternative candidates .
bjelke-petersen finally convinced the legislature to elect a low-level union official , albert field , who had contacted his office and expressed a willingness to serve .
in interviews , field made it clear he would not support whitlam .
field was expelled from the alp for standing against colston , and labor senators boycotted his swearing-in .
whitlam argued that , because of the manner of filling vacancies , the senate was " corrupted " and " tainted " , with the opposition enjoying a majority they did not win at the ballot box .
in october *num* , the opposition , led by malcolm fraser , determined to withhold supply by deferring consideration of appropriation bills .
with field on leave ( his senate appointment having been challenged ) , the coalition had an effective majority of 30–29 in the senate .
the coalition believed that if whitlam could not deliver supply , and would not advise new elections , kerr would have to dismiss him .
supply would run out on *num* november .
the stakes were raised in the conflict on *num* october , when the high court declared valid the act granting the territories two senators each .
in a half-senate election , most successful candidates would not take their places until *num* july *num* , but the territories ' senators , and those filling field's and bunton's seats , would assume their seats immediately .
this gave labor an outside chance of controlling the senate , at least until *num* july *num* .
on *num* october , labor minister rex connor , mastermind of the loans scheme , was forced to resign when khemlani released documents showing that connor had made misleading statements .
the continuing scandal bolstered the coalition in their stance that they would not concede supply .
whitlam on the other hand , convinced that he would win the battle , was glad of the distraction from the loans affair , and believed that he would " smash " not only the senate , but fraser's leadership as well .
whitlam told the house of representatives on *num* october , whitlam and his ministers repeatedly claimed that the opposition was damaging not only the constitution , but the economy as well .
the coalition senators remained united , though several became increasingly concerned about the tactic of blocking supply .
as the crisis dragged into november , whitlam attempted to make arrangements for public servants and suppliers to be able to cash cheques at banks .
these transactions would be temporary loans which the government would repay once supply was restored .
this plan to prolong government without supply was presented to kerr unsigned on *num* november , under the title " draft joint opinion " ( ostensibly of solicitor-general maurice byers and attorney-general kep enderby ) .
it proposed that public employees , including members of the armed forces and police , " could assign arrears of pay by way of mortgage " .
the government's refusal to formalise this and other " advice " was a factor justifying the governor-general's fateful resort to alternative legal advice .
governor-general kerr was following the crisis closely .
at a luncheon with whitlam and several of his ministers on *num* october , kerr suggested a compromise : if fraser conceded supply , whitlam would agree not to call the half-senate election until may or june *num* , or alternatively would agree not to call the senate into session until after *num* july .
whitlam rejected the idea , seeking to end the senate's right to deny supply .
on *num* november , after a meeting with kerr , fraser proposed that if the government agreed to hold a house of representatives election at the same time as the half-senate election , the coalition would concede supply .
whitlam rejected this offer , stating that he had no intention of advising a house election for at least a year .
with the crisis unresolved , kerr decided to dismiss whitlam as prime minister .
fearing that whitlam would go to the queen and potentially have him removed , the governor-general gave whitlam no prior hint .
he conferred ( against whitlam's advice ) with high court chief justice sir garfield barwick , who agreed that he had the power to dismiss whitlam .
a meeting among the party leaders , including whitlam and fraser , to resolve the crisis on the morning of *num* november came to nothing .
kerr and whitlam met at the governor-general's office that afternoon at *num* .
*num* pm .
unknown to whitlam , fraser was waiting in an ante-room ; whitlam later stated that he would not have set foot in the building if he had known fraser was there .
whitlam , as he had told kerr by phone earlier that day , came prepared to advise a half-senate election , to be held on *num* december .
kerr instead told whitlam that he had terminated his commission as prime minister , and handed him a letter to that effect .
after the conversation , whitlam returned to the prime minister's residence , the lodge , had lunch and conferred with his advisers .
immediately after his meeting with whitlam , kerr commissioned fraser as caretaker prime minister , on the assurance he could obtain supply and would then advise kerr to dissolve both houses for election .
in the confusion , whitlam and his advisers did not immediately tell any senate members of the dismissal , with the result that when the senate convened at *num* .
*num* pm , the appropriation bills were rapidly passed , with the alp senators assuming the opposition had given in .
the bills were soon sent to kerr to receive royal assent .
at *num* .
*num* pm , ten minutes after supply had been secured , fraser rose in the house and announced he was prime minister .
whitlam immediately moved a no confidence motion against the new prime minister in the house , which instructed the speaker , gordon scholes , to advise kerr to reinstate whitlam .
kerr refused to receive scholes , keeping him waiting for more than an hour while he prorogued parliament by proclamation : his official secretary , david smith , came to parliament house to proclaim the dissolution from the front steps .
a large , angry crowd had gathered , and smith was nearly drowned out by their noise .
he concluded with the traditional " god save the queen " .
the dismissed prime minister , whitlam , who had been standing behind smith , then addressed the crowd : well may we say " god save the queen " , because nothing will save the governor-general ! the proclamation which you have just heard read by the governor-general's official secretary was countersigned malcolm fraser , who will undoubtedly go down in australian history from remembrance day *num* as kerr's cur .
they won't silence the outskirts of parliament house , even if the inside has been silenced for a few weeks .
.
.
.
maintain your rage and enthusiasm for the campaign for the election now to be held and until polling day .
as the alp began the *num* campaign , it seemed that its supporters would maintain their rage .
early rallies drew huge crowds , with attendees handing whitlam money to pay election expenses .
the crowds greatly exceeded those in any of whitlam's earlier campaigns ; in sydney , *num* , *num* partisans gathered for an alp rally in the domain below a banner : " shame fraser shame " .
fraser's appearances drew protests , and a letter bomb sent to kerr was defused by authorities .
instead of making a policy speech to keynote his campaign , whitlam made a speech attacking his opponents and calling *num* november " a day which will live in infamy " .
polls from the first week of campaigning showed a nine-point swing against labor , which would have decimated labor if repeated in an election .
whitlam's campaign team disbelieved the results at first , but additional polling returns were clear : the electorate had turned against labor .
the coalition attacked labor for economic conditions , and released television commercials including " the three dark years " showing images from whitlam government scandals .
the alp campaign , which had concentrated on the issue of whitlam's dismissal , did not address the economy until its final days .
by that time fraser , confident of victory , was content to sit back , avoid specifics and make no mistakes .
on election night , *num* december , the coalition won the largest majority government in australian history , winning *num* seats to labor's *num* .
labor suffered a *num* .
*num* percent swing against it and its caucus was cut almost in half , suffering a 30-seat swing .
labor was left with five fewer seats than it had when whitlam took the leadership .
the coalition also won a 37–25 majority in the senate .
whitlam stayed on as opposition leader , surviving a leadership challenge .
in early *num* , an additional controversy broke when it was reported that whitlam had been involved in alp attempts to raise $500 , *num* during the election from the ahmed hassan al-bakr government of iraq .
" luckily , for whitlam and labor , the deal , ultimately , went pear-shaped .
" no money had actually been paid , and no charges were filed .
the whitlams were visiting china at the time of the tangshan earthquake in july *num* , though they were staying in tianjin , away from the epicentre .
" the age " printed a cartoon by peter nicholson showing the whitlams huddled together in bed with margaret whitlam saying , " did the earth move for you too , dear ? " this cartoon prompted a page full of outraged letters from labor partisans and a telegram from gough whitlam , safe in tokyo , requesting the original of the cartoon .
in early *num* whitlam faced a leadership challenge from bill hayden , the final treasurer in the whitlam government , and won by a two-vote margin .
fraser called an election for *num* december .
although labor managed to pick up five seats , the coalition still enjoyed a majority of *num* .
according to freudenberg , " the meaning and the message were unmistakable .
it was the australian people's rejection of edward gough whitlam .
" whitlam's son tony , who had joined his father in the house of representatives at the *num* election , was defeated .
shortly after the election , whitlam resigned as party leader and was succeeded by hayden .
whitlam was made a companion of the order of australia in june *num* , and resigned from parliament on *num* july of the same year .
he then held various academic positions .
when labor returned to power under bob hawke in *num* , whitlam was appointed as ambassador to unesco , based in paris .
he served for three years in this post , defending unesco against allegations of corruption .
at the end of his term as australia's ambassador whitlam was elected to the executive board of unesco for a 3-year term , until *num* .
in *num* , he was appointed to australia's constitutional commission .
whitlam was appointed chairman of the national gallery of australia in *num* after his son nick ( then managing director of the state bank of new south wales ) turned down the position .
he and margaret whitlam were part of the bid team that in *num* persuaded the international olympic committee to give sydney the right to host the *num* summer olympics .
john kerr died in *num* .
he and whitlam never reconciled ; indeed , whitlam always saw his dismissal from office as a " constitutional coup d'état " .
whitlam and fraser put aside their differences and became friends during the 1980s , though they never discussed the events of *num* .
the two subsequently campaigned together in support of the *num* australian republic referendum .
in march *num* , fraser visited whitlam at his sydney office while on a book tour to promote his memoirs .
whitlam accepted an autographed copy of the book and presented fraser with a copy of his *num* book about the dismissal , " the truth of the matter " .
in *num* , whitlam's former research assistant mark latham became the leader of the alp .
although latham was more conservative than whitlam , the former prime minister gave latham much support , according to one account " anointing him as his political heir " .
latham , like whitlam , represented werriwa in the house of representatives .
whitlam supported latham when he opposed the invasion and occupation of iraq .
whitlam supported fixed four-year terms for both houses of parliament .
in *num* , he accused the alp of failing to press for this change .
in april *num* , he and margaret whitlam were both made life members of the australian labor party .
this was the first time anyone had been made a life member of the party organisation at the national level .
in *num* , whitlam testified at an inquest into the death of brian peters , one of five australia-based tv personnel killed in east timor in october *num* .
whitlam indicated that he had warned peters ' colleague , greg shackleton ( who was also killed ) , that the australian government could not protect them in east timor and that they should not go there .
he also said that shackleton was " culpable " if he had not passed on whitlam's warning .
whitlam joined three other former prime ministers in february *num* in returning to parliament to witness the federal government apology to the aboriginal stolen generations by the then prime minister kevin rudd .
on *num* january *num* , whitlam achieved a greater age ( ) than any other prime minister of australia , surpassing the previous record holder frank forde .
on the *ord* anniversary of his marriage to margaret whitlam , he called it " very satisfactory " and claimed a record for " matrimonial endurance " .
in *num* , it was reported that whitlam had moved into an aged care facility in sydney's inner east in *num* .
despite this , he continued to go to his office three days a week .
margaret whitlam remained in the couple's nearby apartment .
in early *num* she suffered a fall there , leading to her death in hospital at age *num* on *num* march of that year , a month short of the whitlams ' *ord* wedding anniversary .
gough whitlam died on the morning of *num* october *num* .
his family announced that there would be a private cremation and a public memorial service .
whitlam was survived by his four children , five grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren .
he was the longest-lived australian prime minister , dying at the age of *num* years and *num* days .
a state memorial service was held on *num* november *num* in the sydney town hall and was led by kerry o'brien .
the welcome to country was given by auntie millie ingram and eulogies were delivered by graham freudenberg , cate blanchett , noel pearson , john faulkner and antony whitlam .
pearson's contribution in particular was hailed as " one of the best political speeches of our time " .
musical performances were delivered by william barton ( a didgeridoo improvisation ) , paul kelly and kev carmody ( their land rights protest song " from little things big things grow " ) , as well as the sydney philharmonia choir and the sydney symphony orchestra , conducted by benjamin northey .
in accordance with whitlam's wishes , the orchestra performed " in tears of grief " from bach's " st matthew passion " , " va , pensiero " from verdi's " nabucco " , " un bal " from " symphonie fantastique " by berlioz and , as the final piece , " jerusalem " by parry .
" jerusalem " was followed by a flypast of four raaf f / a-18 hornets in missing man formation .
those attending the memorial included the current and some former governors-general , the current and all living former prime ministers , and members of the family of vincent lingiari .

in honour of whitlam , the australian electoral commission created the division of whitlam in the house of representatives in place of the division of throsby , with effect from the *num* election .
act chief minister katy gallagher announced that a future canberra suburb will be named for whitlam , and that his family would be consulted about other potential memorials .
gough whitlam park in earlwood , new south wales , is named after him .
whitlam remains well remembered for the circumstances of his dismissal .
it is a legacy he did little to efface ; he wrote a *num* book , " the truth of the matter " ( the title is a play on that of kerr's *num* memoir , " matters for judgment " ) and devoted part of his subsequent book , " abiding interests " , to the circumstances of his removal .
according to journalist and author paul kelly , who penned two books on the crisis , whitlam " achieved a paradoxical triumph : the shadow of the dismissal has obscured the sins of his government " .
more books have been written about whitlam , including his own writings , than about any other australian prime minister .
according to whitlam biographer jenny hocking , for a period of at least a decade , the whitlam era was viewed almost entirely in negative terms , but that has changed .
still , she feels that australians take for granted programmes and policies initiated by the whitlam government , such as recognition of china , legal aid , and medicare .
ross mcmullin , who wrote an official history of the alp , notes that whitlam remains greatly admired by many labor supporters because of his efforts to reform australian government , and his inspiring leadership .
some rankings have put whitlam high on the list of australia's better prime ministers .
economist and writer ross gittins evaluated the whitlam government's responses to the economic challenges of the time .
wallace brown describes whitlam in his book about his experiences covering australian prime ministers as a journalist : whitlam was the most paradoxical of all prime ministers in the last half of the *ord* century .
a man of superb intellect , knowledge , and literacy , he yet had little ability when it came to economics .
.
.
.
whitlam rivalled menzies in his passion for the house of representatives and ability to use it as his stage , and yet his parliamentary skills were rhetorical and not tactical .
he could devise a strategy and then often botch the tactics in trying to implement that strategy .
.
.
.
above all he was a man of grand vision with serious blind spots .
whitlam's last words in the documentary film " gough whitlam – in his own words " ( *num* ) were in response to a question about his status as an icon and elder statesman .
he said : "i hope this is not just because i was a martyr ; the fact was , i was an achiever " .

economy of the faroe islands the economy of the faroe islands was the *ord* largest in the world in *num* , having a nominal gross domestic product ( gdp ) of $2 .

the faroes have one of the lowest unemployment rates in europe , but this is not necessarily a sign of a recovering economy , as many young students move to denmark and other countries once they are finished with high school .

bdsm bdsm is a variety of often erotic practices or roleplaying involving bondage , discipline , dominance and submission , sadomasochism , and other related interpersonal dynamics .
given the wide range of practices , some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practising bdsm , inclusion in the bdsm community or subculture is usually dependent upon self-identification and shared experience .
the term " bdsm " is first recorded in a usenet posting from *num* , and is interpreted as a combination of the abbreviations b / d ( bondage and discipline ) , d / s ( dominance and submission ) , and s / m ( sadism and masochism ) .
bdsm is now used as a catch-all phrase covering a wide range of activities , forms of interpersonal relationships , and distinct subcultures .
bdsm communities generally welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who identifies with the community ; this may include cross-dressers , body modification enthusiasts , animal roleplayers , rubber fetishists , and others .
activities and relationships within a bdsm context are often characterized by the participants taking on complementary , but unequal roles ; thus , the idea of informed consent of both the partners is essential .
the terms " submissive " and " dominant " are often used to distinguish these roles : the dominant partner ( " dom " ) takes psychological control over the submissive ( " sub " ) .
the terms " top " and " bottom " are also used : the top is the instigator of an action while the bottom is the receiver of the action .
the two sets of terms are subtly different : for example , someone may choose to act as bottom to another person , for example , by being whipped , purely recreationally , without any implication of being psychologically dominated by them , or a submissive may be ordered to massage their dominant partner .
despite the bottom performing the action and the top receiving they have not necessarily switched roles .
the abbreviations " sub " and " dom " are frequently used instead of " submissive " and " dominant " .
sometimes the female-specific terms " mistress " , " domme " or " dominatrix " are used to describe a dominant woman , instead of the gender-neutral term " dom " .
individuals who can change between top / dominant and bottom / submissive roles—whether from relationship to relationship or within a given relationship—are known as " switches " .
the precise definition of roles and self-identification is a common subject of debate within the community .
"bdsm " is an umbrella term for certain kinds of erotic behavior between consenting adults .
there are distinct subcultures under this umbrella term .
terminology for roles varies widely among the subcultures .
" top " and " dominant " are widely used for those partner ( s ) in the relationship or activity who are , respectively , the physically active or controlling participants .
" bottom " and " submissive " are widely used for those partner ( s ) in the relationship or activity who are , respectively , the physically receptive or controlled participants .
the interaction between tops and bottoms—where physical or mental control of the bottom is surrendered to the top—is sometimes known as " power exchange " , whether in the context of an encounter or a relationship .
bdsm actions can often take place during a specific period of time agreed to by both parties , referred to as " play " , a " scene " , or a " session " .
participants usually derive pleasure from this , even though many of the practices—such as inflicting pain or humiliation or being restrained — would be unpleasant under other circumstances .
explicit sexual activity , such as sexual penetration , may occur within a session , but is not essential .
such explicit sexual interaction is , for legal reasons , seen only rarely in public play spaces , and it is sometimes specifically banned by the rules of a party or playspace .
whether it is a public " playspace"—ranging from a party at an established community dungeon to a hosted play " zone " at a nightclub or social event—the parameters of allowance can vary .
some have a policy of panties / nipple sticker for women ( underwear for men ) and some allow full nudity with explicit sexual interaction allowed .
the fundamental principles for the exercise of bdsm require that it should be performed with the informed consent of all involved parties .
since the 1980s , many practitioners and organizations have adopted the motto ( originally from the statement of purpose of gmsma—a gay sm activist organization ) " safe , sane and consensual " , commonly abbreviated as " ssc " , which means that everything is based on safe activities , that all participants be of sufficiently sound / sane mind to consent , and that all participants do consent .
it is mutual consent that makes a clear legal and ethical distinction between bdsm and such crimes as sexual assault or domestic violence .
some bdsm practitioners prefer a code of behavior that differs from " ssc " and is described as " risk-aware consensual kink " ( rack ) , indicating a preference for a style in which the " individual " responsibility of the involved parties is emphasized more strongly , with each participant being responsible for his or her own well-being .
advocates of rack argue that ssc can hamper discussion of risk because no activity is truly " safe " , and that discussion of even low-risk possibilities is necessary for truly informed consent .
they further argue that setting a discrete line between " safe " and " not-safe " activities ideologically denies consenting adults the right to evaluate risks vs rewards for themselves ; that some adults will be drawn to certain activities regardless of the risk ; and that bdsm play—particularly higher-risk play or edgeplay—should be treated with the same regard as extreme sports , with both respect and the demand that practitioners educate themselves and practice the higher-risk activities to decrease risk .
rack may be seen as focusing primarily upon awareness and informed consent , rather than accepted safe practices .
consent is the most important criterion here .
the consent and compliance for a sadomasochistic situation can be granted only by people who can judge the potential results .
for their consent , they must have relevant information ( extent to which the scene will go , potential risks , if a safeword will be used , what that is , and so on ) at hand and the necessary mental capacity to judge .
the resulting consent and understanding is occasionally summarized in a written " contract " , which is an agreement of what can and cannot take place .
in general , bdsm play is usually structured such that it is possible for the consenting partner to withdraw his or her consent at any point during a scene ; for example , by using a safeword that was agreed on in advance .
use of the agreed safeword ( or occasionally a " safe symbol " such as dropping a ball or ringing a bell , especially when speech is restricted ) is seen by some as an explicit withdrawal of consent .
failure to honor a safeword is considered serious misconduct and could even change the sexual consent situation into a crime , depending on the relevant law , since the bottom or top has explicitly revoked his or her consent to any actions that follow the use of the safeword ( see legal status ) .
for other scenes , particularly in established relationships , a safeword may be agreed to signify a warning ( " this is getting too intense " ) rather than explicit withdrawal of consent ; and a few choose not to use a safeword at all .
the initialism " bdsm " includes these psychological and physiological facets : this model for differentiating among these aspects of bdsm is increasingly used in literature today .
nevertheless , it is only an attempt at phenomenological differentiation .
individual tastes and preferences in the area of human sexuality may overlap among these areas , which are discussed separately here .
bondage and discipline are two aspects of bdsm that do not seem to relate to each other because of the type of activities involved , but they have conceptual similarities , and that is why they appear jointly .
contrary to the other two types , b&d does not define the tops and bottoms itself , and is used to describe the general activities with either partner being the receiver and the giver .
the term " bondage " describes the practice of physical restraint .
bondage is usually , but not always , a sexual practice .
while bondage is a very popular variation within the larger field of bdsm , it is nevertheless sometimes differentiated from the rest of this field .
a *num* study of over *num* , *num* canadians showed that about half of all men held fantasies of bondage , and almost half of all women did as well .
strictly speaking , bondage means binding the partner by tying their appendages together ; for example , by the use of handcuffs or ropes , or by lashing their arms to an object .
bondage can also be achieved by spreading the appendages and fastening them with chains or ropes to a st .
andrew's cross or spreader bars .
the term " discipline " describes psychological restraining , with the use of rules and punishment to control overt behavior .
punishment can be pain caused physically ( such as caning ) , humiliation caused psychologically ( such as a public flagellation ) or loss of freedom caused physically ( for example , chaining the submissive partner to the foot of a bed ) .
another aspect is the structured training of the bottom .
"dominance and submission " ( also known as d&s , ds or d / s ) is a set of behaviors , customs and rituals relating to the giving and accepting of control of one individual over another in an erotic or lifestyle context .
it explores the more mental aspect of bdsm .
this is also the case in many relationships not considering themselves as sadomasochistic ; it is considered to be a part of bdsm if it is practiced purposefully .
the range of its individual characteristics is thereby wide .
often , " contracts " are set out in writing to record the formal consent of the parties to the power exchange , stating their common vision of the relationship dynamic .
the purpose of this kind of agreement is primarily to encourage discussion and negotiation in advance , and then to document that understanding for the benefit of all parties .
such documents have not been recognized as being legally binding , nor are they intended to be .
these agreements are binding in the sense that the parties have the expectation that the negotiated rules will be followed .
often other friends and community members may witness the signing of such a document in a ceremony , and so parties violating their agreement can result in loss of face , respect or status with their friends in the community .
in general , as compared to conventional relationships , bdsm participants go to great lengths to negotiate the important aspects of their relationships in advance , and to take great care in learning about and following safe practices .
in d / s , the dominant is the top and the submissive is the bottom .
in s / m , the sadist is usually the top and the masochist the bottom , but these roles are frequently more complicated or jumbled ( as in the case of being dominant , masochists who may arrange for their submissive to carry out s / m activities on them ) .
as in b / d , the declaration of the top / bottom may be required , though sadomasochists may also play without any power exchange at all , with both partners equally in control of the play .
the term " sadomasochism " is derived from the words " sadism " and " masochism " .
these terms differ somewhat from the same terms used in psychology , since those require that the sadism or masochism cause significant distress or involve non-consenting partners .
" sadomasochism " refers to the aspects of bdsm surrounding the exchange of physical or emotional pain .
sadism describes sexual pleasure derived by inflicting pain , degradation , humiliation on another person or causing another person to suffer .
on the other hand , the masochist enjoys being hurt , humiliated , or suffering within the consensual scenario .
sadomasochistic scenes sometimes reach a level that appear more extreme or cruel than other forms of bdsm—for example , when a masochist is brought to tears or is severely bruised—and is occasionally unwelcome at bdsm events or parties .
sadomasochism does not imply enjoyment through causing or receiving pain in other situations ( for example , accidental injury , medical procedures ) .
the terms " sadism " and " masochism " are derived from the names of the marquis de sade and leopold von sacher-masoch , based on the content of the authors ' works .
although the names of de sade and sacher-masoch are attached to the terms sadism and masochism respectively , the scenes described in de sade's works do not meet modern bdsm standards of informed consent .
bdsm is solely based on consensual activities , and based on its system and laws .
the concepts presented by de sade are not in accordance with the bdsm culture , even though they are sadistic in nature .
in *num* the ruthenian physician heinrich kaan published " psychopathia sexualis " ( " psychopathy of sex " ) , a writing in which he converts the sin conceptions of christianity into medical diagnoses .
with his work the originally theological terms " perversion " , " aberration " and " deviation " became part of the scientific terminology for the first time .
the german psychiatrist richard von krafft ebing introduced the terms " sadism " and " masochism " to the medical community in his work " neue forschungen auf dem gebiet der psychopathia sexualis " ( " new research in the area of psychopathy of sex " ) in *num* .
in *num* , sigmund freud described " sadism " and " masochism " in his " three essays on the theory of sexuality " as diseases developing from an incorrect development of the child psyche and laid the groundwork for the scientific perspective on the subject in the following decades .
this led to the first time use of the compound term " sado-masochism " ( german " sado-masochismus " ) by the viennese psychoanalytic isidor isaak sadger in their work , " über den sado-masochistischen komplex " ( " regarding the sadomasochistic complex " ) in *num* .
in the later *ord* century , bdsm activists have protested against these conceptual models , as they were derived from the philosophies of two singular historical figures .
both freud and krafft-ebing were psychiatrists ; their observations on sadism and masochism were dependent on psychiatric patients , and their models were built on the assumption of psychopathology .
bdsm activists argue that it is illogical to attribute human behavioural phenomena as complex as sadism and masochism to the ' inventions ' of two historic individuals .
advocates of bdsm have sought to distinguish themselves from widely held notions of antiquated psychiatric theory by the adoption of the initialized term , " bdsm " as a distinction from the now common usage of those psychological terms , abbreviated as " s&m " .
on a physical level , bdsm is commonly misconceived to be " all about pain " .
most often , though , bdsm practitioners are primarily concerned with power , humiliation , and pleasure .
of the three categories of bdsm , only sadomasochism specifically requires pain , but this is typically a means to an end , as a vehicle for feelings of humiliation , dominance , etc .
the aspects of d / s and b / d may not include physical suffering at all , but include the sensations experienced by different emotions of the mind .
dominance & submission of power is an entirely different experience , and is not always psychologically associated with physical pain .
many bdsm activities might not involve any kind of pain or humiliation , but just the exchange of power and control .
during the activities , the practitioners may feel endorphins comparable to the so-called " runner's high " or to the afterglow of orgasm .
the corresponding trance-like mental state is also known as " subspace " for the submissive , or " topspace " for the dominant .
some use the term " body stress " to describe this physiological sensation .
this experience of algolagnia is important , but is not the only motivation for many bdsm practitioners .
the philosopher edmund burke defines this sensation of pleasure derived from pain by the word " sublime " .
research has shown that couples engaging in consensual bdsm tend to show hormonal changes that indicate decreases in stress and increases in emotional bonding .
there is a wide array of bdsm practitioners who take part in sessions for which they do not receive any personal gratification .
they enter such situations solely with the intention to allow their partners to fulfill their own needs or fetishes .
professional dominants do this in exchange of money for the session activities , but non-professionals do it for the sake of their partners .
in some bdsm sessions , the top exposes the bottom to a wide range of sensual experiences , for example : pinching , biting , scratching with fingernails , erotic spanking or the use of objects such as crops , whips , liquid wax , ice cubes , wartenberg wheels , and erotic electrostimulation devices .
fixation by handcuffs , ropes or chains may be used as well .
the repertoire of possible " toys " is limited only by the imagination of both partners .
to some extent , everyday items like clothes-pins , wooden spoons or plastic wrap are used as pervertables .
it is commonly considered that a pleasurable bdsm experience during a session is very strongly dependent upon the top's competence and experience and the bottom's physical and mental state at the time of the session .
trust and sexual arousal help the partners enter a shared mindset .
some types of bdsm play include , but are not limited to : aside from the general advice related to safe sex , bdsm sessions often require a wider array of safety precautions than vanilla sex ( sexual behaviour without bdsm elements ) .
in theory , to ensure consent related to bdsm activity , pre-play negotiations are commonplace , especially among partners who do not know each other very well .
in practice , pick-up scenes at clubs or parties may sometimes be low in negotiation ( much as pick-up sex from singles bars may not involve much negotiation or disclosure ) .
these negotiations concern the interests and fantasies of each partner and establish a framework of both acceptable and unacceptable activities .
this kind of discussion is a typical " unique selling proposition " of bdsm sessions and quite commonplace .
additionally , safewords are often arranged to provide for an immediate stop of any activity if any participant should so desire .
safewords are words or phrases that are called out when things are either not going as planned or have crossed a threshold one cannot handle .
they are something both parties can remember and recognize and are , by definition , not words commonly used playfully during any kind of scene .
words such as " no " , " stop " , and " don't " , are often inappropriate as a safeword if the roleplaying aspect includes the illusion of non-consent .
the most commonly used safewords are " red " and " yellow " , with " red " meaning that play must stop immediately , and " yellow " meaning that the activity needs to slow down .
" green " is sometimes used to indficate that the activity is desired , and should continue .
at most clubs and group-organized bdsm parties and events , dungeon monitors ( dms ) provide an additional safety net for the people playing there , ensuring that house rules are followed and safewords respected .
bdsm participants are expected to understand practical safety aspects .
for instance , they are expected to recognize that parts of the body can be damaged , such as nerves and blood vessels by contusion , or that skin that can be scarred .
using crops , whips , or floggers , the top's fine motor skills and anatomical knowledge can make the difference between a satisfying session for the bottom and a highly unpleasant experience that may even entail severe physical harm .
the very broad range of bdsm " toys " and physical and psychological control techniques often requires a far-reaching knowledge of details related to the requirements of the individual session , such as anatomy , physics , and psychology .
despite these risks , bdsm activities usually result in far less severe injuries than sports like boxing and football , and bdsm practitioners do not visit emergency rooms any more often than the general population .
it is necessary to be able to identify each person's psychological " squicks " or triggers in advance to avoid them .
such losses of emotional balance due to sensory or emotional overload are a fairly commonly discussed issue .
it is important to follow participants ' reactions empathetically and continue or stop accordingly .
for some players , sparking " freakouts " or deliberately using triggers may be a desired outcome .
safewords are one way for bdsm practices to protect both parties .
however , partners should be aware of each other's psychological states and behaviors to prevent instances where the " freakouts " prevent the use of safewords .
at one end of the spectrum are those who are indifferent to , or even reject physical stimulation .
at the other end of the spectrum are bottoms who enjoy discipline and erotic humiliation but are not willing to be subordinate to the person who applies it .
the bottom is frequently the partner who specifies the basic conditions of the session and gives instructions , directly or indirectly , in the negotiation , while the top often respects this guidance .
other bottoms often called " brats " try to incur punishment from their tops by provoking them or " misbehaving " .
nevertheless , a purist " school " exists within the bdsm community , which regards such " topping from the bottom " as rude or even incompatible with the standards of bdsm relations .
bdsm practitioners sometimes regard the practice of bdsm in their sex life as roleplaying and so often use the terms " play " and " playing " to describe activities where in their roles .
play of this sort for a specified period of time is often called a " session " , and the contents and the circumstances of play are often referred to as the " scene " .
it is also common in personal relationships to use the term " kink play " for bdsm activities , or more specific terms for the type of activity .
the relationships can be of varied types .
early writings on bdsm both by the academic and bdsm community spoke little of long-term relationships with some in the gay leather community suggesting short-term play relationships to be the only feasible relationship models , and recommending people to get married and " play " with bdsm outside of marriage .
in recent times though writers of bdsm and sites for bdsm have been more focused on long-term relationships .
a *num* study , the first to look at these relationships , fully demonstrated that " quality long-term functioning relationships " exist among practitioners of bdsm , with either sex being the top or bottom ( homosexual couples were not looked at ) .
respondents in the study expressed their bdsm orientation to be built into who they are , but considered exploring their bdsm interests an ongoing task , and showed flexibility and adaptability in order to match their interests with their partners .
the " perfect match " where both in the relationship shared the same tastes and desires was rare , and most relationships required both partners to take up or put away some of their desires .
the bdsm activities that the couples partook in varied in sexual to nonsexual significance for the partners who reported doing certain bdsm activities for " couple bonding , stress release , and spiritual quests " .
the most reported issue amongst respondents was not finding enough time to be in role with most adopting a lifestyle wherein both partners maintain their dominant or submissive role throughout the day .
amongst the respondents , it was typically the bottoms who wanted to play harder , and be more restricted into their roles when there was a difference in desire to play in the relationship .
the author of the study , bert cutler , speculated that tops may be less often in the mood to play due to the increased demand for responsibility on their part : being aware of the safety of the situation and prepared to remove the bottom from a dangerous scenario , being conscious of the desires and limits of the bottom , and so on .
the author of the study stressed that successful long-term bdsm relationships came after " early and thorough disclosure " from both parties of their bdsm interests .
many of those engaged in long-term bdsm relationships learned their skills from larger bdsm organizations and communities there was a lot of discussion by the respondents on the amount of control the top possessed in the relationships with almost non-existent discussion of the top " being better , or smarter , or of more value " than the bottom .
couples were generally of the same mind of whether or not they were in an ongoing relationship , but in such cases the bottom was not locked up constantly , but that their role in the context of the relationship was always present , even when the top was doing non-dominant activities such as household chores , or the bottom being in a more dominant position .
in its conclusion the study states : the study further goes on to list three aspects that made the successful relationships work : early disclosure of interests and continued transparency , a commitment to personal growth , and the use of the dominant / submissive roles as a tool to maintain the relationship .
in his closing remarks , the author of the study theorizes that due to the serious potential for harm , couples in bdsm relationships develop increased communication that may be higher than in mainstream relationships .
a professional dominatrix or professional dominant , often referred to within the culture as a " pro-dom ( me ) " , offers services encompassing the range of bondage , discipline , and dominance in exchange for money .
the term " dominatrix " is little-used within the non-professional bdsm scene .
a non-professional dominant woman is more commonly referred to simply as a " domme " , " dominant " , or " femdom " ( short for female dominance ) .
there are also services provided by professional female submissives ( " pro-subs " ) .
a professional submissive consents to her client's dominant behavior within negotiated limits , and often works within a professional dungeon .
professional submissives , although far more rare , do exist .
most of the people who work as subs normally have tendencies towards such activities , especially when sadomasochism is involved .
males also work as professional " tops " in bdsm , and are called " masters " or " doms " .
however it is much more rare to find a male in this profession .
a male " pro-dom " typically only works with male clientele .
in bdsm , a " scene " is the stage or setting where bdsm activity takes place , as well as the activity itself .
the physical place where a bdsm activity takes place is usually called a dungeon , though some prefer less dramatic terms , including " playspace " , or " club " .
a bdsm activity can , but need not , involve sexual activity or sexual roleplay .
a characteristic of many bdsm relationships is the power exchange from the bottom to the dominant partner , and bondage features prominently in bdsm scenes and sexual roleplay .
'the scene ' ( including use of the definite article ' the ' ) is also used in the bdsm community to refer to the bdsm community as a whole .
thus someone who is on ' the scene ' , and prepared to play in public , might take part in ' a scene ' at a public play party .
a scene can take place in private between two or more people , and can involve a domestic arrangement , such as servitude or a casual or committed lifestyle master / slave relationship .
bdsm elements may involve settings of slave training or punishment for breaches of instructions .
a scene can also take place in a club , where the play can be viewed by others .
when a scene takes place in a public setting , it may be because the participants enjoy being watched by others , or because of the equipment available , or because having third parties present adds safety for play partners who have only recently met .
standard social etiquette rules still apply when at a bdsm event , such as not intimately touching someone you do not know , not touching someone else's belongings ( including toys ) , and abiding by dress codes .
many events open to the public also have rules addressing alcohol consumption , recreational drugs , cell phones , and photography .
a specific scene takes place within the general conventions and etiquette of bdsm , such as requirements for mutual consent and agreement as to the limits of any bdsm activity .
this agreement can be incorporated into a formal contract .
in addition , most clubs have additional rules which regulate how onlookers may interact with the actual participants in a scene .
as is the general rule in bdsm , these are founded on the catchphrase " safe , sane , and consensual " .
bdsm play parties are events in which bdsm practitioners and other similarly interested people meet in order to communicate , share experiences and knowledge , and to " play " in an erotic atmosphere .
the parties show similarities with ones in the dark culture , being based on a more or less strictly enforced dress code ; most often clothing made of latex , leather or vinyl / pvc , lycra and so on , emphasizing the body's shape and the primary and secondary sexual characteristic .
the requirement for such dress codes differ .
while some events have none , others have a policy in order to create a more coherent atmosphere and to prevent onlookers from taking part .
at these parties , bdsm can be publicly performed on a stage , or more privately in separate " dungeons " .
a reason for the relatively fast spread of this kind of event is the opportunity to use a wide range of " playing equipment " , which in most apartments or houses is unavailable .
slings , st .
andrew's crosses ( or similar restraining constructs ) , spanking benches , and punishing supports or cages are often made available .
the problem of noise disturbance is also lessened at these events , while in the home setting many bdsm activities can be limited by this factor .
in addition , such parties offer both exhibitionists and voyeurs a forum to indulge their inclinations without social criticism .
sexual intercourse is not permitted within most public bdsm play spaces or not often seen in others , because it is not the emphasis of this kind of play .
in order to ensure the maximum safety and comfort for the participants certain standards of behavior have evolved ; these include aspects of courtesy , privacy , respect and safewords .
today bdsm parties are taking place in most of the larger cities in the western world .
this scene appears particularly on the internet , in publications , and in meetings such as at fetish clubs ( like torture garden ) , sm parties , gatherings called munches , and erotic fairs like venus berlin .
the annual folsom street fair is the world's largest bdsm event and is held in san francisco .
it has its roots in the gay leather movement .
the weekend long festivities include a wide range of sadomasochistic erotica in a public clothing optional space between *ord* and *ord* streets with nightly parties associated with the organization .
there are also conventions such as living in leather and black rose .
it has often been assumed that a preference for bdsm is a consequence of childhood abuse .
research indicates that there is no evidence for this claim .
some reports suggest that people abused as children may have more bdsm injuries and have difficulty with safe words being recognized as meaning stop the previously consensual behavior , thus , it is possible that people choosing bdsm as part of their lifestyle , who also were previously abused , may have had more police or hospital reports of injuries .
there is also a link between transgender individuals who have been abused and violence occurring in bdsm activities there are a number of reasons commonly given for why a sadomasochist finds the practice of s&m enjoyable , and the answer is largely dependent on the individual .
for some , taking on a role of compliance or helplessness offers a form of therapeutic escape ; from the stresses of life , from responsibility , or from guilt .
for others , being under the power of a strong , controlling presence may evoke the feelings of safety and protection associated with childhood .
they likewise may derive satisfaction from earning the approval of that figure " ( see : servitude ( bdsm ) ) " .
a sadist , on the other hand , may enjoy the feeling of power and authority that comes from playing the dominant role , or receive pleasure vicariously through the suffering of the masochist .
it is poorly understood , though , what ultimately connects these emotional experiences to sexual gratification , or how that connection initially forms .
joseph merlino , author and psychiatry adviser to the " new york daily news " , said in an interview that a sadomasochistic relationship , as long as it is consensual , is not a psychological problem : it is agreed on by some psychologists that experiences during early sexual development can have a profound effect on the character of sexuality later in life .
sadomasochistic desires , however , seem to form at a variety of ages .
some individuals report having had them before puberty , while others do not discover them until well into adulthood .
according to one study , the majority of male sadomasochists ( *num* % ) developed their interest before the age of *num* , while the majority of females ( *num* % ) developed their interest afterwards ( breslow , evans , and langley *num* ) .
the prevalence of sadomasochism within the general population is unknown .
despite female sadists being less visible than males , some surveys have resulted in comparable amounts of sadistic fantasies between females and males .
the results of such studies demonstrate that one's sex does not determine preference for sadism .
following a phenomenological study of nine individuals involved in sexual masochistic sessions who regarded pain as central to their experience , sexual masochism was described as an addiction-like tendency , with several features resembling that of drug addiction : craving , intoxication , tolerance and withdrawal .
it was also demonstrated how the first masochistic experience is placed on a pedestal , with subsequent use aiming at retrieving this lost sensation , much as described in the descriptive literature on addiction .
the addictive pattern presented in this study suggests an association with behavioral spin as found in problem gamblers .
bdsm is practiced in all social strata and is common in both heterosexual and homosexual men and women in varied occurrences and intensities .
the spectrum ranges from couples with no connections to the subculture outside of their bedrooms or homes , without any awareness of the concept of bdsm , playing " tie-me-up-games " , to public scenes on st .
andrew's crosses at large events such as the folsom street fair in san francisco .
estimation on the overall percentage of bdsm related sexual behaviour vary but it is no longer assumed to be uncommon .
alfred kinsey stated in his *num* nonfiction book " sexual behavior in the human female " that *num* % of females and *num* % of males reported having an erotic response to a sadomasochistic story .
in that book erotic responses to being bitten were given as : a non-representative survey on the sexual behaviour of american students published in *num* and based on questionnaires had a response rate of about 8–9 % .
its results showed *num* % of homosexual and bisexual males , *num* % of lesbian and female bisexual students , *num* % of heterosexual males and *num* % of female heterosexual students committed to bdsm related fantasies .
in all groups the level of practical bdsm experiences were around *num* % .
within the group of openly lesbian and bisexual females the quote was significantly higher , at *num* % .
independent of their sexual orientation , about *num* % of all questioned students , *num* % of lesbians and female bisexuals and *num* % of heterosexual males articulated an interest in spanking .
experience with this sexual behaviour was indicated by *num* % of male heterosexuals , *num* % of female bisexuals and lesbians , and *num* % of the male gay and bisexual men and female heterosexual women .
even though this study was not considered representative , other surveys indicate similar dimensions in a differing target groups .
a representative study done from *num* to *num* in australia found that *num* .
*num* % of sexually active people ( *num* .
*num* % men , *num* .
*num* % women but no significant sex difference ) had engaged in bdsm activity in the previous year .
of the entire sample , *num* .
*num* % men and *num* .
*num* % women had been involved in bdsm .
bdsm activity was significantly more likely among bisexuals and homosexuals of both sexes .
but among men in general , there was no relationship effect of age , education , language spoken at home , or relationship status .
among women , in this study , activity was most common for those between *num* and *num* years of age and least likely for females over *num* years .
activity was also significantly more likely for women who had a regular partner they did not live with , but was not significantly related with speaking a language other than english or education .
another representative study , published in *num* by the german institut für rationale psychologie , found that about *num* / *num* of the interviewed women stated a desire to be at the mercy of their sexual partners from time to time .
*num* % admitted to fantasies dealing with sexual submissiveness , *num* % stated interest in explicit bdsm techniques , *num* % in bondage .
a *num* study in the general us population suggests three percent have had positive experiences with bondage or master-slave roleplaying .
overall *num* % of the interviewed females and *num* % of the males were willing to try it .
a *num* kinsey institute report stated that *num* % to *num* % of americans occasionally engage in sexual activities related to bdsm .
*num* % of men and *num* % of women reported trying bondage .
some elements of bdsm have been popularized through increased media coverage since the middle 1990s .
thus both black leather clothing , sexual jewellery such as chains and dominance roleplay appear increasingly outside of bdsm contexts .
according to yet another survey of *num* , *num* people in *num* countries , about *num* % of the surveyed have at least used masks , blindfolds or other bondage utilities once , and *num* % explicitly connected themselves with bdsm .
in *num* , *num* % mentioned spanking as one of their practices and *num* % confirmed the use of blindfolds or handcuffs .
a *num* study found *num* out of *num* female respondents ( *num* % ) were involved in sadomasochistic activities .
a *num* study on two separate samples of male undergraduate students in canada found that *num* to *num* % , depending on the sample , had entertained sadistic fantasies , and *num* to *num* % engaged in sadistic behaviors during sex .
the figures were *num* and *num* % for bondage fantasies , and *num* to *num* % for bondage behaviors .
a *num* study involving a mixed sample of canadian college students and online volunteers , both male and female , reported that *num* % of male samples and *num* % of female samples rated the sadistic scenarios described in a questionnaire as being at least " slightly arousing " on a scale that ranged from " very repulsive " to " very arousing " ; the difference was statistically significant .
the corresponding figures for the masochistic scenarios were *num* % for male students and *num* % for female students , a non-significant difference .
in a *num* study on *num* middle-aged and elderly men recruited from the broader community in berlin , *num* .
*num* % of the men self-reported sadistic fantasies and *num* .
*num* % sadistic behaviors ; *num* .
*num* % self-reported any such fantasy and / or behavior .
the corresponding figures for self-reported masochism were *num* .
*num* % for fantasy , *num* .
*num* % for behavior , and *num* .
*num* % for fantasy and / or behavior .
in a *num* study on gay men in puerto rico , *num* .
*num* % of the over *num* community volunteers reported any sadistic fantasy , desire or behavior in their lifetime ; the corresponding figure for masochism was *num* .
*num* % .
a *num* cross-sectional representative survey among the general belgian population demonstrated a substantial prevalence of bdsm fantasies and activities ; *num* .
*num* % of the population performed one of more bdsm-practices on a regular basis .
reflecting changes in social norms , modern medical opinion is now moving away from regarding bdsm activities as medical disorders , unless they are nonconsensual or involve significant distress or harm .
in the past , the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm ) , the american psychiatric association's manual , defined some bdsm activities as sexual disorders .
following campaigns from advocacy organizations including the national coalition for sexual freedom , the current version of the dsm , dsm-5 , excludes consensual bdsm from diagnosis when the sexual interests cause no harm or distress .
the world health organization's international classification of diseases ( icd ) has made similar moves in recent years .
section f65 of the current revision , icd-10 , indicates that " mild degrees of sadomasochistic stimulation are commonly used to enhance otherwise normal sexual activity " .
the diagnostic guidelines for the icd-10 state that this class of diagnosis should only be made " if sadomasochistic activity is the most important source of stimulation or necessary for sexual gratification " .
in europe , an organization called revisef65 has worked to remove sadomasochism from the icd .
in *num* , denmark became the first european union country to have completely removed sadomasochism from its national classification of diseases .
this was followed by sweden in *num* , norway in *num* and finland *num* .
recent surveys on the spread of bdsm fantasies and practices show strong variations in the range of their results .
nonetheless , researchers assume that *num* to *num* percent of the population practices sexual behavior related to pain or dominance and submission .
the population with related fantasies is believed to be even larger .
the icd is in the process of revision , and recent drafts have reflected these changes in social norms .
, the final advance preview of the icd-11 has de-pathologised most things listed in icd-10 section f65 , characterizing as pathological only those activities which are either coercive , or involving significant risk of injury or death , or distressing to the individual committing them , and specifically excluding consensual sexual sadism and masochism from being regarded as pathological .
the icd-11 classification consider sadomasochism as a variant in sexual arousal and private behaviour without appreciable public health impact and for which treatment is neither indicated nor sought .
" according to the who icd-11 working group on sexual disorders and sexual health , stigmatization and discrimination of fetish- and bdsm individuals are inconsistent with human rights principles endorsed by the united nations and the world health organization .
the final advance text is to be officially presented to the members of the who in *num* , ready to come into effect in *num* .
some people who feel attracted by the situations usually compiled under the term bdsm reach a point where they decide to come out of the closet , though many sadomasochists keep themselves closeted .
even so , depending upon a survey's participants , about *num* to *num* percent of the us population show affinity to the subject .
other than a few artists and writers , practically no celebrities are publicly known as sadomasochists .
public knowledge of one's bdsm lifestyle can have devastating vocational and social effects for sadomasochists .
many face severe professional consequences or social rejection if they are exposed , either voluntarily or involuntarily , as sadomasochists .
within feminist circles the discussion has been split roughly into two camps : some who see bdsm as an aspect or reflection of oppression ( for example , alice schwarzer ) and , on the other side , pro-bdsm feminists , often grouped under the banner of sex-positive feminism ( see samois ) ; both of them can be traced back to the 1970s .
some feminists have criticized bdsm for eroticizing power and violence , and for reinforcing misogyny .
they argue that women who engage in bdsm are making a choice that is ultimately bad for women .
feminist defenders of bdsm argue that consensual bdsm activities are enjoyed by many women and validate the sexual inclinations of these women .
they argue that there is no connection between consensual kinky activities and sex crimes , and that feminists should not attack other women's sexual desires as being " anti-feminist " .
they also state that the main point of feminism is to give an individual woman free choices in her life ; which includes her sexual desire .
while some feminists suggest connections between consensual bdsm scenes and non-consensual rape and sexual assault , other sex-positive ones find the notion insulting to women .
it is often mentioned that in bdsm , roles are not fixed to gender , but personal preferences .
the dominant partner in a heterosexual relationship may be the woman rather than the man ; or bdsm may be part of male / male or female / female sexual relationships .
finally , some people switch , taking either a dominant or submissive role on different occasions .
several studies investigating the possibility of correlation between bdsm pornography and the violence against women also indicate a lack of correlation .
as an example , japan is listed as the country with the lowest sexual crime rate out of all the industrialized nations , despite being known for its distinct bdsm and bondage pornography ( see pornography in japan ) .
in *num* a lateral survey came to the conclusion that between *num* and *num* , despite the increase in amount and availability of sadomasochistic pornography in the us , germany , denmark and sweden there is no correlation with the national number of rapes to be found .
operation spanner in the uk proves that bdsm practitioners still run the risk of being stigmatized as criminals .
in *num* , the media coverage of jack mcgeorge showed that simply participating and working in bdsm support groups poses risks to one's job , even in countries where no law restricts it .
here a clear difference can be seen to the situation of homosexuality .
the psychological strain appearing in some individual cases is normally neither articulated nor acknowledged in public .
nevertheless , it leads to a difficult psychological situation in which the person concerned can be exposed to high levels of emotional stress .
in the stages of " self awareness " , he or she realizes their desires related to bdsm scenarios or decides to be open for such .
some authors call this " internal coming-out " .
two separate surveys on this topic independently came to the conclusion that *num* percent and *num* percent of the sample respectively , had realized their disposition before their *ord* birthday .
other surveys on this topic show comparable results .
independent of age , coming-out can potentially result in a difficult life crisis , sometimes leading to thoughts or acts of suicide .
while homosexuals have created support networks in the last decades , sadomasochistic support networks are just starting to develop in most countries .
in german speaking countries they are only moderately more developed .
the internet is the prime contact point for support groups today , allowing for local and international networking .
in the us kink aware professionals ( kap ) a privately funded , non-profit service provides the community with referrals to psychotherapeutic , medical , and legal professionals who are knowledgeable about and sensitive to the bdsm , fetish , and leather community .
in the us and the uk , the woodhull freedom foundation & federation , national coalition for sexual freedom ( ncsf ) and sexual freedom coalition ( sfc ) have emerged to represent the interests of sadomasochists .
the german bundesvereinigung sadomasochismus is committed to the same aim of providing information and driving press relations .
in *num* the website and mailing list datenschlag went online in german and english providing the largest bibliography , as well as one of the most extensive historical collections of sources related to bdsm .
richters et al .
( *num* ) study also found that people who engaged in bdsm were more likely to have experienced a wider range of sexual practices ( e .
g .
oral or anal sex , more than one partner , group sex , phone sex , viewed pornography , used a sex toy , fisting , rimming , etc .
) .
they were , however , not any more likely to have been coerced , unhappy , anxious , or experiencing sexual difficulties .
on the contrary , men who had engaged in bdsm scored lower on a psychological distress scale than men who did not .
there have been few studies on the psychological aspects of bdsm using modern scientific standards .
psychotherapist charles moser has said there is no evidence for the theory that bdsm has common symptoms or any common psychopathology , emphasizing that there is no evidence that bdsm practitioners have any special psychiatric other problems based on their sexual preferences .
problems do sometimes occur in the area of self classification by the person concerned .
during the phase of the " coming-out " , self-questioning related to one's own " normality " is quite common .
according to moser , the discovery of bdsm preferences " can " result in fear of the current non-bdsm relationship's destruction .
this , combined with the fear of discrimination in everyday life , leads in some cases to a double life which can be highly burdensome .
at the same time , the denial of bdsm preferences can induce stress and dissatisfaction with one's own " vanilla"-lifestyle , feeding the apprehension of finding no partner .
moser states that bdsm practitioners having problems finding bdsm partners would probably have problems in finding a non-bdsm partner as well .
the wish to remove bdsm preferences is another possible reason for psychological problems since it is not possible in most cases .
finally , the scientist states that bdsm practitioners seldom commit violent crimes .
from his point of view , crimes of bdsm practitioners usually have no connection with the bdsm components existing in their life .
moser's study comes to the conclusion that there is no scientific evidence , which could give reason to refuse members of this group work- or safety certificates , adoption possibilities , custody or other social rights or privileges .
the swiss psychoanalyst fritz morgenthaler shares a similar perspective in his book , " homosexuality , heterosexuality , perversion " ( *num* ) .
he states that possible problems result not necessarily from the non-normative behavior , but in most cases primarily from the real or feared reactions of the social environment towards their own preferences .
in *num* psychoanalyst theodor reik reached implicitly the same conclusion in his standard work " aus leiden freuden .
masochismus und gesellschaft " .
moser's results are further supported by a *num* australian study by richters " et al .
" on the demographic and psychosocial features of bdsm participants .
the study found that bdsm practitioners were no more likely to have experienced sexual assault than the control group , and were not more likely to feel unhappy or anxious .
the bdsm males reported higher levels of psychological well-being than the controls .
it was concluded that " bdsm is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority , not a pathological symptom of past abuse or difficulty with ' normal ' sex .
" several recent studies have been conducted on the gender differences and personality traits of bdsm practitioners .
wismeijer & van assen ( *num* ) found that " the association of bdsm role and gender was strong and significant " with only *num* % of women in the study being dominant compared to *num* % being submissive .
; hébert & weaver ( *num* ) found that *num* % of women in their study were dominant compared to *num* % submissive ; and weierstall1 & giebel ( *num* ) likewise found a significant difference , with *num* % of women in the study as dominant compared to *num* % as submissive .
they concluded that " men more often display an engagement in dominant practices , whereas females take on the submissive part .
this result is inline with a recent study about mate preferences that has shown that women have a generally higher preference for a dominant partner than men do ( giebel , moran , schawohl , & weierstall , *num* ) .
women also prefer dominant men , and even men who are aggressive , for a short-term relationship and for the purpose of sexual intercourse ( giebel , weierstall , schauer , & elbert , *num* ) " .
similarly , studies on sexual fantasy differences between men and women show the latter prefer submissive and passive fantasies over dominant and active ones , with rape and force being common .
one common belief of bdsm and kink is that women are more likely to take on masochistic roles than men .
roy baumeister ( *num* ) actually had more male masochists in his study than female , and fewer male dominants than female .
the lack of statistical significance in these gender differences suggests that no assumptions should be made regarding gender and masochistic roles in bdsm .
one explanation why we might think otherwise lies in our social and cultural ideals about femininity ; masochism may emphasize certain stereotypically feminine elements through activities like feminization of men and ultra-feminine clothing for women .
but such tendencies of the submissive masochistic role should not be interpreted as a connection between it and the stereotypical female role—many masochistic scripts do not include any of these tendencies .
baumeister found that masochistic males experienced greater : severity of pain , frequency of humiliation ( status-loss , degrading , oral ) , partner infidelity , active participation by other persons , and cross dressing .
trends also suggested that male masochism included more bondage and oral sex than female ( though the data was not significant ) .
female masochists , on the other hand , experienced greater : frequency in pain , pain as punishment for ' misdeeds ' in the relationship context , display humiliation , genital intercourse , and presence of non-participating audiences .
the exclusiveness of dominant males in a heterosexual relationship happens because , historically , men in power preferred multiple partners .
finally , baumeister observes a contrast between the ' intense sensation ' focus of male masochism to a more ' meaning and emotion ' centred female masochistic script .
prior argues that although some of these women may appear to be engaging in traditional subordinate or submissive roles , bdsm allows women in both dominant and submissive roles to express and experience personal power through their sexual identities .
in a study that she conducted in *num* , she found that the majority of the women she interviewed identified as bottom , submissive , captive , or slave / sex slave .
in turn , prior was able to answer whether or not these women found an incongruity between their sexual identities and feminist identity .
her research found that these women saw little to no incongruity , and in fact felt that their feminist identity supported identities of submissive and slave .
for them these are sexually and emotionally fulfilling roles and identities that , in some cases , feed other aspects of their lives .
prior contends that third wave feminism provides a space for women in bdsm communities to express their sexual identities fully , even when those identities seem counter-intuitive to the ideals of feminism .
furthermore , women who do identify as submissive , sexually or otherwise , find a space within bdsm where they can fully express themselves as integrated , well-balanced , and powerful women .
levitt , moser , & jamison's *num* study provides a general , if outdated , description of characteristics of women in the sadomasochistic ( s / m ) subculture .
they state that women in s / m tend to have higher education , become more aware of their desires as a young adult , are less likely to be married than the general population .
the researchers found the majority of females identified as heterosexual and submissive , a substantial minority were versatile—able to switch between dominant and submissive roles—and a smaller minority identified with the dominant role exclusively .
oral sex , bondage and master-slave script were among the most popular activities , while feces / watersports were the least popular .
bdsm is not a sexual orientation or identity , but it is considered one by some of its practitioners .
the bdsm and kink scene is more often seen as a diverse pansexual community .
often this is a non-judgmental community where gender , sexuality , orientation , preferences are accepted as is or worked at to become something a person can be happy with .
in research , studies have focused on bisexuality and its parallels with bdsm , as well as gay-straight differences between practitioners .
demographically , nordling et al .
' s ( *num* ) study found no differences in age , but *num* % of gay male respondents compared to *num* % of straight males had university level education .
the gay men also had higher incomes than the general population , and tended to work in white collar jobs while straight men tended toward blue collar ones .
because there were not enough female respondents ( *num* ) , no conclusions could be drawn from them .
sexually speaking , the same *num* study by nordling et al .
found that gay males were aware of their s / m preferences and took part in them at an earlier age , preferring leather , anal sex , rimming , dildos and special equipment or uniform scenes .
in contrast , straight men preferred verbal humiliation , mask and blindfolds , gags , rubber / latex outfits , caning , vaginal sex , and cross-dressing among other activities .
from the questionnaire , researchers were able to identify four separate sexual themes : hyper-masculinity , giving and receiving pain , physical restriction ( i .
e .
bondage ) , and psychological humiliation .
gay men preferred activities that tended towards hyper-masculinity while straight men showed greater preference for humiliation .
though there were not enough female respondents to draw a similar conclusion with , the fact that there is a difference in gay and straight men suggests strongly that s / m ( and bdsm in general ) can not be considered a homogenous phenomenon .
as nordling et al .
( *num* ) puts it , " people who identify as sadomasochists mean different things by these identifications .
" ( *num* ) in steve lenius ' original *num* paper he explored the acceptance of bisexuality in a supposedly pansexual bdsm community .
the reasoning behind this is that ' coming-out ' had become primarily the territory of the gay and lesbian , with bisexuals feeling the push to be one or the other ( and being right only half the time either way ) .
what he found in *num* , was that people in bdsm were open to discussion about the topic of bisexuality and pansexuality and all controversies they bring to the table , but personal biases and issues stood in the way of actively using such labels .
a decade later , lenius ( *num* ) looks back on his study and considers if anything has changed .
he concluded that the standing of bisexuals in the bdsm and kink community was unchanged , and believed that positive shifts in attitude were moderated by society's changing views towards different sexualities and orientations .
but lenius ( *num* ) does emphasize that the pansexual promoting bdsm community helped advance greater acceptance of alternative sexualities .
brandy lin simula ( *num* ) , on the other hand , argues that bdsm actively resists gender conforming and identified three different types of bdsm bisexuality : gender-switching , gender-based styles ( taking on a different gendered style depending on gender of partner when playing ) , and rejection of gender ( resisting the idea that gender matters in their play partners ) .
simula ( *num* ) explains that practitioners of bdsm routinely challenge our concepts of sexuality by pushing the limits on pre-existing ideas of sexual orientation and gender norms .
for some , bdsm and kink provides a platform in creating identities that are fluid , ever-changing .
psychiatry has an insensitive history in the area of bdsm .
there have been many involvements by institutions of political power to marginalize subgroups and sexual minorities .
mental health professionals have a long history of holding negative assumptions and stereotypes about the bdsm community .
beginning with the dsm-ii , sexual sadism and sexual masochism have been listed as sexually deviant behaviours .
sadism and masochism were also found in the personality disorder section .
this negative assumption has not changed significantly which is evident in the continued inclusion of sexual sadism and sexual masochism as paraphilias in the dsm-iv-tr .
the dsm-v , however , has depathologized the language around paraphilias in a way that signifies " the apa's intent to not demand treatment for healthy consenting adult sexual expression " .
these biases and misinformation can result in pathologizing and unintentional harm to clients who identify as sadists and / or masochists and medical professionals who have been trained under older editions of the dsm can be slow to change in their ways of clinical practice .
according to kolmes et al .
( *num* ) , major themes of biased and inadequate care to bdsm clients are : these same researchers suggested that therapists should be open to learning more about bdsm , to show comfort in talking about bdsm issues , and to understand and promote " safe , sane , consensual " bdsm .
there has also been research which suggests bdsm can be a beneficial way for victims of sexual assault to deal with their trauma , most notably by corie hammers , but this work is limited in scope and to date , has not undergone empirical testing as a treatment .
nichols ( *num* ) compiled some common clinical issues : countertransference , non-disclosure , coming-out , partner / families , and bleed-through .
countertransference is a common problem in clinical settings .
despite having no evidence , therapists may find themselves believing that their client's pathology is " self-evident " .
therapists may feel intense disgust and aversive reactions .
feelings of countertransference can interfere with therapy .
another common problem is when clients conceal their sexual preferences from their therapists .
this can compromise any therapy .
to avoid non-disclosure , therapists are encouraged to communicate their openness in indirect ways with literatures and artworks in the waiting room .
therapists can also deliberately bring up bdsm topics during the course of therapy .
with less informed therapists , sometimes they over-focus on clients ' sexuality which detracts from original issues such as family relationships , depression , etc .
a special subgroup that needs counselling is the " newbie " .
individuals just coming out might have internalized shame , fear , and self-hatred about their sexual preferences .
therapists need to provide acceptance , care , and model positive attitude ; providing reassurance , psychoeducation , and bibliotherapy for these clients is crucial .
the average age when bdsm individuals realize their sexual preference is around *num* years .
many people hide their sexuality until they can no longer contain their desires .
however , they may have married or had children by this point .
practices of bdsm survive from some of the oldest textual records in the world , associated with rituals to the goddess inanna ( ishtar in akkadian ) .
cuneiform texts dedicated to inanna which incorporate domination rituals .
in particular she points to ancient writings such as inanna and ebih ( in which the goddess dominates ebih ) , and hymn to inanna describing cross-dressing transformations and rituals " imbued with pain and ecstasy , bringing about initation and journeys of altered states of consciousness ; punishment , moaning , ecstasy , lament and song , participants exhausting themselves in weeping and grief .
" during the ninth century bc , ritual flagellations were performed in artemis orthia , one of the most important religious areas of ancient sparta , where the cult of orthia , a preolympic religion , was practiced .
here ritual flagellation called " diamastigosis " took place , in which young adolescent men were whipped in a ceremony overseen by the priestess .
these are referred to by a number of ancient authors , including pausanius ( iii , *num* : 10-11 ) .
one of the oldest graphical proofs of sadomasochistic activities is found in the etruscan tomb of the whipping near tarquinia , which dates to the fifth century bc .
inside the tomb there is fresco which portrays two men who flagellate a woman with a cane and a hand during an erotic situation .
another reference related to flagellation is to be found in the sixth book of the " satires " of the ancient roman poet juvenal ( *ord* century a .
d .
) , further reference can be found in petronius's " satyricon " where a delinquent is whipped for sexual arousal .
anecdotal narratives related to humans who have had themselves voluntary bound , flagellated or whipped as a substitute for sex or as part of foreplay reach back to the third and fourth century .
in pompeii , a whip-mistress figure with wings is depicted on the wall of the villa of mysteries , as part of an initiation of a young woman into the mysteries .
the whip-mistress role drove the sacred initiation of ceremonial death and rebirth .
the archaic greek aphrodite may too once have been armed with an implement , with archaeological evidence of armed aphrodite known from a number of locations in cythera , acrocorinth and sparta , and which may have been a whip .
the " kama sutra " of india describes four different kinds of hitting during lovemaking , the allowed regions of the human body to target and different kinds of joyful " cries of pain " practiced by bottoms .
the collection of historic texts related to sensuous experiences explicitly emphasizes that impact play , biting and pinching during sexual activities should only be performed consensually since only some women consider such behavior to be joyful .
from this perspective the kama sutra can be considered as one of the first written resources dealing with sadomasochistic activities and safety rules .
further texts with sadomasochistic connotation appear worldwide during the following centuries on a regular basis .
there are anecdotal reports of people willingly being bound or whipped , as a prelude to or substitute for sex , during the *ord* century .
the medieval phenomenon of courtly love in all of its slavish devotion and ambivalence has been suggested by some writers to be a precursor of bdsm .
some sources claim that bdsm as a distinct form of sexual behavior originated at the beginning of the *ord* century when western civilization began medically and legally categorizing sexual behavior ( see etymology ) .
flagellation practiced within an erotic setting has been recorded from at least the 1590s evidenced by a john davies epigram , and references to " flogging schools " in thomas shadwell's " the virtuoso " ( *num* ) and tim tell-troth's " knavery of astrology " ( *num* ) .
visual evidence such as mezzotints and print media is also identified revealing scenes of flagellation , such as " the cully flaug'd " from the british museum collection .
john cleland's novel " fanny hill " , published in *num* , incorporates a flagellation scene between the character's protagonist fanny hill and mr barville .
a large number of flagellation publications followed , including " " ( c .
*num* ) , promoting the names of ladies offering the service in a lecture room with rods and cat o ' nine tails .
other sources give a broader definition , citing bdsm-like behavior in earlier times and other cultures , such as the medieval flagellates and the physical ordeal rituals of some native american societies .
bdsm ideas and imagery have existed on the fringes of western culture throughout the twentieth century .
robert bienvenu attributes the origins of modern bdsm to three sources , which he names as " european fetish " ( from *num* ) , " american fetish " ( from *num* ) , and " gay leather " ( from *num* ) .
another source are the sexual games played in brothels , which go back into the *ord* century if not earlier .
charles guyette was the first american to produce and distribute fetish related material ( costumes , footwear , photography , props and accessories ) in the us .
his successor , irving klaw , produced commercial sexploitation film and photography with a bdsm theme ( most notably with bettie page ) and issued fetish comics ( known then as " chapter serials " ) by the now-iconic artists john willie , gene bilbrew , and eric stanton .
stanton's model bettie page became at the same time one of the first successful models in the area of fetish photography and one of the most famous pin-up girls of american mainstream culture .
italian author and designer guido crepax was deeply influenced by him , coining the style and development of european adult comics in the second half of the twentieth century .
the artists helmut newton and robert mapplethorpe are the most prominent examples of the increasing use of bdsm-related motives in modern photography and the public discussions still resulting from this .
alfred binet first coined the term " erotic fetishism " in his *num* book , " du fétichisme dans l'amour " richard von krafft-ebing saw bdsm interests as the end of a continuum .
leather has been a predominantly gay male term to refer to one fetish , but it can stand for many more .
members of the gay male leather community may wear leathers such as motorcycle leathers , or may be attracted to men wearing leather .
leather and bdsm are seen as two parts of one whole .
much of the bdsm culture can be traced back to the gay male leather culture , which formalized itself out of the group of men who were soldiers returning home after world war ii ( 1939–1945 ) .
wwii was the setting where countless homosexual men and women tasted the life among homosexual peers .
post-war , homosexual individuals congregated in larger cities such as new york , chicago , san francisco , and los angeles .
they formed leather clubs and bike clubs , some were fraternal services .
the establishment of mr .
leather contest and mr .
drummer contest were made around this time .
this was the genesis of the gay male leather community .
many of the members were attracted to extreme forms of sexuality , for which peak expression was in the pre-aids 1970s .
this subculture is epitomized by the " leatherman's handbook " by larry townsend , published in *num* , which describes in detail the practices and culture of gay male sadomasochists in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
in the early 1980s , lesbians also joined the leathermen as a recognizable element of the gay leather community .
they also formed leather clubs , but there were some gender differences such as the absence of leatherwomen's bar .
in *num* , the publication of " coming to power " by lesbian-feminist group samois led to a greater knowledge and acceptance of bdsm in the lesbian community .
by the 1990s , the gay men's and women's leather communities were no longer underground and played an important role in the kink community .
today the leather movement is generally seen as a part of the bdsm-culture instead of as a development deriving from gay subculture , even if a huge part of the bdsm-subculture was gay in the past .
in the 1990s the so-called new guard leather subculture evolved .
this new orientation started to integrate psychological aspects into their play .
the san francisco south of market leather history alley consists of four works of art along ringold alley honoring leather culture ; it opened in *num* .
one of the works of art is metal bootprints along the curb which honor *num* people ( including steve mceachern , owner of the catacombs , a gay and lesbian s / m fisting club , and cynthia slater , a founder of the society of janus , the second oldest bdsm organization in the united states ) who were an important part of the leather communities of san francisco .
in the late-eighties , the internet provided a way of finding people with specialized interests around the world as well as on a local level , and communicating with them anonymously .
this brought about an explosion of interest and knowledge of bdsm , particularly on the usenet group alt .
sex .
bondage .
when that group became too cluttered with spam , the focus moved to soc .
subculture .
bondage-bdsm .
with an increased focus on forms of social media , fetlife was formed , which advertises itself as " a social network for the bdsm and fetish community " .
it operates similarly to other social media sites , with the ability to make friends with other users , events , and pages of shared interests .
in addition to traditional sex shops , which sell sex paraphernalia , there has also been an explosive growth of online adult toy companies that specialize in leather / latex gear and bdsm toys .
once a very niche market , there are now very few sex toy companies that do not offer some sort of bdsm or fetish gear in their catalog .
kinky elements seem to have worked their way into " vanilla " markets .
the former niche expanded to an important pillar of the business with adult accessories .
today practically all suppliers of sex toys do offer items which originally found usage in the bdsm subculture .
padded handcuffs , latex and leather garments , as well as more exotic items like soft whips for fondling and tens for erotic electro stimulation can be found in catalogs aiming on classical vanilla target groups , indicating that former boundaries increasingly seem to shift .
during the last years the internet also provides a central platform for networking among individuals who are interested in the subject .
besides countless private and commercial choices there is an increasing number of local networks and support groups emerging .
these groups often offer comprehensive background and health related information for people who have been unwillingly outed as well as contact lists with information on psychologists , physicians and lawyers who are familiar with bdsm related topics .
increasingly , american universities are witnessing bdsm and kink education by providing student clubs , such as columbia university's conversio virium and iowa state university's cuffs .
university bdsm clubs are also found in the uk , canada , belgium , and taiwan .
some american universities—such as indiana university and michigan state university—have professors who research and take classes on bdsm .
section *num* of the criminal code declares bodily injury ( §§ 83-84 ) or the endangerment of physical security ( § *num* ) to not be subject to penalty in cases in which the victim has consented and the injury or endangerment does not offend moral sensibilities .
case law from the austrian supreme court has consistently shown that bodily injury is only offensive to moral sensibilities , thus it is only punishable when a " serious injury " ( a damage to health or an employment disability lasting more than *num* days ) or the death of the " victim " results .
a " light injury " is generally considered " permissible " when the " victim " has consented to it .
in cases of threats to bodily well being the standard depends on the probability that an injury will actually occur .
if serious injury or even death would be a likely result of a threat being carried out , then even the threat itself is considered punishable .
in *num* a judge in canada ruled that videos seized by the police featuring bdsm activities were not obscene , and did not constitute violence , but a " normal and acceptable " sexual activity between two consenting adults .
in *num* , the supreme court of canada ruled in " r .
v .
j .
a .
" that a person must have an active mind during the specific sexual activity in order to legally consent .
the court ruled that it is a criminal offence to perform a sexual act on an unconscious person—whether or not that person consented in advance .
according to § *num* the charge of insult ( slander ) can only be prosecuted if the defamed person chooses to press charges .
false imprisonment can be charged if the victim—when applying an objective view—can be considered to be impaired in his or her rights of free movement .
according to § *num* of the german criminal code a person inflicting a bodily injury on another person with that person's permission violates the law only in cases where the act can be considered to have violated good morals in spite of permission having been given .
on *num* may *num* the criminal panel no .
*num* of the bundesgerichtshof ( german federal court ) ruled that sado-masochistically motivated physical injuries are not per se indecent and thus subject to § *num* .
following cases in which sado-masochistic practices had been repeatedly used as pressure tactics against former partners in custody cases , the appeals court of hamm ruled in february *num* that sexual inclinations toward sado-masochism are no indication of a lack of capabilities for successful child-raising .
in italian law bdsm is right on the border between crime and legality , and everything lies in the interpretation of the legal code by the judge .
this concept is that anyone willingly causing " injury " to another person is to be punished .
in this context though " injury " is legally defined as " anything causing a condition of illness " , and " illness " is ill-defined itself in two different legal ways .
the first is " any anatomical or functional alteration of the organism " ( thus technically including little scratches and bruises too ) ; the second is " a significant worsening of a previous condition relevant to organic and relational processes , requiring any kind of therapy " .
this could make it somewhat risky to play with someone as later the " victim " may call foul play citing even an insignificant mark as evidence against the partner .
also any injury requiring over *num* days of medical care must be denounced by the professional medic who discovers it , leading to automatic indictment of the person who caused it .
in september *num* a swedish court acquitted a 32-year-old man of assault for engaging in consensual bdsm play with a 16-year-old woman ( the age of consent in sweden is *num* ) .
norway's legal system has likewise taken a similar position , that safe and consensual bdsm play should not be subject to criminal prosecution .
this parallels the stance of the mental health professions in the nordic countries which have removed sadomasochism from their respective lists of psychiatric illnesses .
the age of consent in switzerland is *num* years which also applies for bdsm play .
minors ( i .
e .
those under *num* ) are not subject to punishment for bdsm play as long as the age difference between them is less than three years .
certain practices however require granting consent for light injuries with only those over *num* permitted to give consent .
on *num* april *num* articles *num* and *num* of the swiss criminal code were tightened to make ownership of " "objects or demonstrations [ .
.
.
] which depict sexual acts with violent content" " a punishable offense .
this law amounts to a general criminalization of sado-masochism since nearly every sado-masochist will have some kind of media which fulfills this criterion .
critics also object to the wording of the law which puts sado-masochists in the same category as pedophiles and pederasts .
in british law , consent is an absolute defence to common assault , but not necessarily to actual bodily harm , where courts may decide that consent is not valid , as occurred in the case of r v brown .
accordingly , consensual activities in the uk may not constitute " assault occasioning actual or grievous bodily harm " in law .
the spanner trust states that this is defined as activities which have caused injury " of a lasting nature " but that only a slight duration or injury might be considered " lasting " in law .
the decision contrasts with the later case of r v wilson in which conviction for non-sexual consensual branding within a marriage was overturned , the appeal court ruling that r v brown was not an authority in all cases of consensual injury and criticizing the decision to prosecute .
following operation spanner the european court of human rights ruled in january *num* in laskey , jaggard and brown v .
united kingdom that no violation of article *num* occurred because the amount of physical or psychological harm that the law allows between any two people , even consenting adults , is to be determined by the jurisdiction the individuals live in , as it is the state's responsibility to balance the concerns of public health and well-being with the amount of control a state should be allowed to exercise over its citizens .
in the criminal justice and immigration bill *num* , the british government cited the spanner case as justification for criminalizing images of consensual acts , as part of its proposed criminalization of possession of " "extreme pornography" " .
another contrasting case was that of stephen lock in *num* , who was cleared of actual bodily harm on the grounds that the woman consented .
in this case , the act was deemed to be sexual .
the united states federal law does not list a specific criminal determination for consensual bdsm acts .
many bdsm practitioners cite the legal decision of people v .
jovanovic , *num* n .
y .
2d *num* ( *num* ) , or the " cybersex torture case " , which was the first u .
s .
appellate decision to hold ( in effect ) that one does not commit assault if the victim consents .
however , many individual states do criminalize specific bdsm actions within their state borders .
some states specifically address the idea of " consent to bdsm acts " within their assault laws , such as the state of new jersey , which defines " simple assault " to be " a disorderly persons offense unless committed in a fight or scuffle " entered into by mutual consent " , in which case it is a petty disorderly persons offense " .
oregon ballot measure *num* was a ballot measure in the u .
s .
state of oregon in *num* , concerning sadism , masochism , gay rights , pedophilia , and public education , that drew widespread national attention .
it would have added the following text to the oregon constitution : it was defeated in *num* november *num* general election with *num* , *num* votes in favor , *num* , *num* votes against .
the national coalition for sexual freedom collects reports about punishment for sexual activities engaged in by consenting adults , and about its use in child custody cases .
today the bdsm culture exists in most western countries .
this offers bdsm practitioners the opportunity to discuss bdsm relevant topics and problems with like-minded people .
this culture is often viewed as a subculture , mainly because bdsm is often still regarded as " unusual " by some of the public .
many people hide their leaning from society since they are afraid of the incomprehension and of social exclusion .
in contrast to frameworks seeking to explain sadomasochism through psychological , psychoanalytic , medical or forensic approaches , which seek to categorize behaviour and desires and find a root " cause " , romana byrne suggests that such practices can be seen as examples of " aesthetic sexuality " , in which a founding physiological or psychological impulse is irrelevant .
rather , sadism and masochism may be practiced through choice and deliberation , driven by certain aesthetic goals tied to style , pleasure , and identity .
these practices , in certain circumstances and contexts , can be compared with the creation of art .
one of the most commonly used symbols of the bdsm community is a derivation of a triskelion shape within a circle .
various forms of triskele have had many uses and many meanings in many cultures ; its bdsm usage derives from the " ring of o " in the classic book " story of o " .
the bdsm emblem project claims copyright over one particular specified form of the triskelion symbol ; other variants of the triskelion are free from such copyright claims .
the leather pride flag is a symbol for the leather subculture and also widely used within bdsm .
in continental europe , the " ring of o " is widespread among bdsm practitioners .
the triskelion as a bdsm symbol can easily be perceived as the three separate parts of the acronym bdsm ; which are bd , ds , and sm ( bondage & discipline , dominance & submission , sadism & masochism ) .
they are three separate items , that are normally associated together .
the bdsm rights flag , shown to the right , is intended to represent the belief that people whose sexuality or relationship preferences include bdsm practises deserve the same human rights as everyone else , and should not be discriminated against for pursuing bdsm with consenting adults .
the flag is inspired by the leather pride flag and bdsm emblem , but is specifically intended to represent the concept of bdsm rights and to be without the other symbols ' restrictions against commercial use .
it is designed to be recognisable by people familiar with either the leather pride flag or bdsm triskelion ( or triskele ) as " something to do with bdsm " ; and to be distinctive whether reproduced in full colour , or in black and white ( or another pair of colours ) .
bdsm and fetish items and styles have been spread widely in western societies ' everyday life by different factors , such as avant-garde fashion , heavy metal , goth subculture , and science fiction tv series , and are often not consciously connected with their bdsm roots by many people .
while it was mainly confined to the punk and bdsm subcultures in the 1990s , it has since spread into wider parts of western societies .
although it would be possible to establish certain elements related to bdsm in classical theater , not until the emergence of contemporary theatre would some plays have bdsm as the main theme .
exemplifying this are two works : one austrian , one german , in which bdsm is not only incorporated , but integral to the storyline of the play .
although examples of literature catering to bdsm and fetishistic tastes were created in earlier periods , bdsm literature as it exists today cannot be found much earlier than world war ii .
the word sadism originates from the works of donatien alphonse françois , marquis de sade , and the word masochism originates from leopold von sacher-masoch , the author of " venus in furs " .
however , it is worth noting that the marquis de sade describes unconsented abuse in his works , such as in " justine " .
" venus in furs " describes a consented domme-sub relationship .
a central work in modern bdsm literature is undoubtedly the " story of o " ( *num* ) by anne desclos under the pseudonym pauline réage .
other notable works include " *num* weeks " ( *num* ) by elizabeth mcneill , some works of the writer anne rice ( " exit to eden " , and her " claiming of sleeping beauty " series of books ) , jeanne de berg ( " l'image " ( *num* ) dedicated to pauline réage ) .
works from the gor series by john norman , and naturally all the works of patrick califia , gloria brame , the group samois and many of the writer georges bataille ( histoire de l'oeil-story of the eye , madame edwarda , *num* ) , as well as bob flanagan : " slave sonnets " ( *num* ) , " fuck journal " ( *num* ) , " a taste of honey " ( *num* ) .
a common part of many of the poems of pablo neruda is a reflection on feelings and sensations arising from the relations of epe or erotic exchange of power .
the " fifty shades " trilogy is a series of very popular erotic romance novels by e .
l .
james which involve bdsm ; however the novels have been criticized for their inaccurate and harmful depiction of bdsm .
in the *ord* century , a number of prestigious university presses , such as duke university , indiana university and university of chicago , have published books on bdsm written by professors , thereby lending academic legitimacy to this once taboo topic .
fiddle fiddling refers to the act of playing the fiddle , and fiddlers are musicians that play it .
a fiddle is a bowed string musical instrument , most often a violin .
it is a colloquial term for the violin , used by players in all genres including classical music .
although violins and fiddles are essentially synonymous , the style of the music played may determine specific construction differences between fiddles and classical violins .
for example , fiddles may optionally be set up with a bridge with a flatter arch to reduce the range of bow-arm motion needed for techniques such as the double shuffle , a form of bariolage involving rapid alternation between pairs of adjacent strings .
to produce a " brighter " tone , compared to the deeper tones of gut or synthetic core strings , fiddlers often use steel strings .
the fiddle is part of many traditional ( folk ) styles , which are typically aural traditions—taught ' by ear ' rather than via written music .
among musical styles , fiddling tends to produce rhythms that focus on dancing , with associated quick note changes , whereas classical music tends to contain more vibrato and sustained notes .
fiddling is also open to improvisation and embellishment with ornamentation at the player's discretion—in contrast to orchestral performances , which adhere to the composer's notes to reproduce a work faithfully .
it is less common for a classically trained violinist to play folk music , but today , many fiddlers ( e .
g .
, alasdair fraser , brittany haas , alison krauss , etc .
) have classical training .
the medieval fiddle emerged in 10th-century europe , deriving from the byzantine lira ( greek : " λύρα " , latin : " lira " , english : " lyre " ) , a bowed string instrument of the byzantine empire and ancestor of most european bowed instruments .
the first recorded reference to the bowed lira was in the *ord* century by the persian geographer ibn khurradadhbih ( d .
*num* ) ; in his lexicographical discussion of instruments he cited the lira ( lūrā ) as a typical instrument of the byzantines and equivalent to the rabāb played in the islamic empires .
lira spread widely westward to europe ; in the *ord* and *ord* centuries european writers use the terms " fiddle " and " lira " interchangeably when referring to bowed instruments .
over the centuries , europe continued to have two distinct types of fiddles : one , relatively square-shaped , held in the arms , became known as the viola da braccio ( " arm viol " ) family and evolved into the violin ; the other , with sloping shoulders and held between the knees , was the viola da gamba ( " leg viol " ) group .
during the renaissance the gambas were important and elegant instruments ; they eventually lost ground to the louder ( and originally less aristocratic ) " viola da braccio " family .
the etymology of " fiddle " is uncertain : the germanic " fiddle " may derive from the same early romance word as does " violin " , or it may be natively germanic .
the name appears to be related to icelandic fiðla and also old english " fiðele " .
a native germanic ancestor of " fiddle " might even be the ancestor of the early romance form of " violin " .
in medieval times , " fiddle " also referred to a predecessor of today's violin .
like the violin , it tended to have four strings , but came in a variety of shapes and sizes .
another family of instruments that contributed to the development of the modern fiddle are the viols , which are held between the legs and played vertically , and have fretted fingerboards .
in performance , a solo fiddler , or one or two with a group of other instrumentalists , is the norm , though twin fiddling is represented in some north american , scandinavian , scottish and irish styles .
following the folk revivals of the second half of the *ord* century , however , it has become common for less formal situations to find large groups of fiddlers playing together—see for example the calgary fiddlers , swedish spelmanslag folk-musician clubs , and the worldwide phenomenon of irish sessions .
orchestral violins , on the other hand , are commonly grouped in sections , or " chairs " .
these contrasting traditions may be vestiges of historical performance settings : large concert halls where violins were played required more instruments , before electronic amplification , than did more intimate dance halls and houses that fiddlers played in .
the difference was likely compounded by the different sounds expected of violin music and fiddle music .
historically , the majority of fiddle music was dance music , while violin music had either grown out of dance music or was something else entirely .
violin music came to value a smoothness that fiddling , with its dance-driven clear beat , did not always follow .
in situations that required greater volume , a fiddler ( as long as they kept the beat ) could push their instrument harder than could a violinist .
various fiddle traditions have differing values .
in the very late *ord* century , a few artists have successfully attempted a reconstruction of the scottish tradition of violin and " big fiddle , " or cello .
notable recorded examples include iain fraser and christine hanson , amelia kaminski and christine hanson's bonnie lasses , alasdair fraser and natalie haas ' fire and grace .
, and tim macdonald and jeremy ward's " the wilds " .
hungarian , slovenian , and romanian fiddle players are often accompanied by a three-stringed variant of the viola—known as the " kontra"—and by double bass , with cimbalom and clarinet being less standard yet still common additions to a band .
in hungary , a three stringed viola variant with a flat bridge , called the " kontra " or " háromhúros brácsa " makes up part of a traditional rhythm section in hungarian folk music .
the flat bridge lets the musician play three-string chords .
a three stringed double bass variant is also used .
to a greater extent than classical violin playing , fiddle playing is characterized by a huge variety of ethnic or folk music traditions , each of which has its own distinctive sound .
american fiddling , a broad category including traditional and modern styles fiddling remains popular in canada , and the various homegrown styles of canadian fiddling are seen as an important part of the country's cultural identity , as celebrated during the opening ceremony of the vancouver *num* winter olympics .
enron enron corporation was an american energy , commodities , and services company based in houston , texas .

at the end of *num* , it was revealed that enron's reported financial condition was sustained by institutionalized , systematic , and creatively planned accounting fraud , known since as the enron scandal .
enron has since become a well-known example of willful corporate fraud and corruption .
the scandal also brought into question the accounting practices and activities of many corporations in the united states and was a factor in the enactment of the sarbanes–oxley act of *num* .
the scandal also affected the greater business world by causing the dissolution of the arthur andersen accounting firm , which had been enron's main auditor for years .
enron filed for bankruptcy in the southern district of new york in late *num* and selected weil , gotshal & manges as its bankruptcy counsel .
it ended its bankruptcy during november *num* , pursuant to a court-approved plan of reorganization .
a new board of directors changed the name of enron to enron creditors recovery corp .
, and emphasized reorganizing and liquidating certain operations and assets of the pre-bankruptcy enron .
on september *num* , *num* , enron sold prisma energy international inc .
, its last remaining business , to ashmore energy international ltd .
( now aei ) .
one of enron's primary predecessors was the northern natural gas company , which was formed in *num* , in omaha , nebraska just a few months after black tuesday .
the low cost of natural gas and cheap labor supply during the great depression helped to fuel the company's early beginnings .
the company doubled in size by *num* and was able to bring the first natural gas to minnesota .
over the next *num* years , northern expanded even more as it acquired many energy companies and created new divisions within .
it was reorganized in *num* as the main subsidiary of a holding company , internorth , which was a diversified energy and energy-related products company .
although most of the acquisitions conducted were successful , some ended poorly .
internorth competed with cooper industries over a hostile takeover of crouse-hinds company , an electrical products manufacturer .
internorth was ultimately unsuccessful as cooper bought out crouse-hinds .
cooper and internorth feuded over numerous suits during the course of the takeover that were eventually settled after the transaction was completed .
the subsidiary northern natural gas operated the largest natural gas pipeline company in north america .
by the 1980s , internorth became a major force for natural gas production , transmission , and marketing as well as for natural gas liquids , and was an innovator in the plastics industry .
in *num* , internorth merged with the belco petroleum company , a fortune *num* oil exploration and development company founded by arthur belfer .
the houston natural gas ( hng ) corporation was initially formed from the houston oil co .
in *num* to provide gas to customers in the houston market through the building of gas pipelines .
under the leadership of ceo robert herring from *num* to *num* , the company became a large dominant force in the energy industry with a large pipeline network as a result from a prosperous period of growth in the early to mid-1970s .
this growth was largely a result of the exploitation of the unregulated texas natural gas market and the commodity surge in the early 1970s .
toward the end of the 1970s , hng's luck began to run out with rising gas prices forcing clients to switch to oil .
in addition , with the passing of the natural gas policy act of *num* , the texas market was more difficult to profit from and as a result , hng's profits fell .
after herring's death in *num* , m .
d .
matthews briefly took over as ceo in a 3-year stint with initial success , but ultimately , a big dip in earnings led to his exit .
in *num* , kenneth lay succeeded matthews and inherited the troubled , but large diversified energy conglomerate .
internorth , in its conservative success , became a target of corporate takeovers , the most prominent being corporate raider irwin jacobs .
internorth ceo sam segnar , in searching for a company to merge with to fend off takeover attempts as a poison pill , discovered hng .
in may *num* , internorth acquired hng for $2 .
*num* billion , *num* % higher than the current market price , in order to avoid the corporate takeover attempt .
the combined assets of the two companies would create the second largest gas pipeline system at the time in the united states .
internorth’s north-south pipelines that served iowa and minnesota complemented hng’s florida and california east-west pipelines well .
the company was initially named " hng / internorth inc .
" , even though internorth was technically the parent .
at the outset , segnar was ceo for a short time , before he was fired by the board of directors whereupon lay was tapped to be the new ceo .
lay moved the headquarters of the new company back to energy capital houston .
the company then set out to find a new name , spent upwards of $100 , *num* in focus groups and consulting before " enteron " was suggested .
the name was eventually dismissed over its apparent likening to an intestine and shortened to " enron .
" ( the distinctive logo was one of the final major projects of legendary graphic designer paul rand before his death in *num* .
) enron still had some lingering problems left over from its merger , however .
the company had to pay jacobs , who was still a threat , over $350 million and reorganize the company .
lay sold off any parts of the company that he believed didn't belong in the long-term future of enron .
lay consolidated all the gas pipeline efforts under the enron gas pipeline operating company .
in addition , the company began to ramp up its electric power and natural gas efforts .
in *num* and *num* , the company began adding power plants and cogeneration units to its portfolio .
in *num* , jeffrey skilling , then a consultant at mckinsey & co .
, came up with the idea to link natural gas to consumers in more ways , effectively turning natural gas into a commodity .
enron adopted the idea and called it the " gas bank .
" the division's success prompted skilling to join enron as the head of the gas bank in *num* .
another major development inside enron was the beginning of the company's pivot to overseas that was expanded upon in the 1990s .
starting in *num* , the company received a $56 million loan from the overseas private investment corporation ( opic ) for a power plant in argentina .
over the course of the 1990s , enron made a few changes to its business plan that greatly improved the perceived profitability of the company .
first , enron invested heavily in overseas assets , specifically energy .
another major shift was the gradual transition of focus from a producer of energy to a company that acted more like an investment firm and sometimes a hedge fund , making profits off the margins of the products it traded .
these products were traded through the gas bank concept , now called the enron finance corp .
headed by skilling .
with the success of the gas bank trading natural gas , skilling looked to expand the horizons of his division , enron capital & trade .
skilling hired andrew fastow in *num* to help with this .
starting in *num* under the energy policy act of *num* , congress allowed states to deregulate their electricity utilities , allowing them to be opened for competition .
california was one such state to do so .
enron , seeing an opportunity with rising prices , was eager to jump into the market .
in *num* , enron acquired portland general electric ( pge ) .
although an oregon utility , it had potential to begin serving the massive california market since pge was a regulated utility .
the new enron division , enron energy , ramped up its efforts by offering discounts to potential customers in california for switching their electric supplier to enron from their previous supplier , starting in *num* .
enron energy also began to sell natural gas to customers in ohio and wind power in iowa .
however , in *num* , the company ended its retail endeavor , only offering wholesale energy as it was revealed it was spending upwards of $100 million a year .
as fiber optic technology progressed in the 1990s , multiple companies , including enron , attempted to make money by " keeping the continuing network costs low , " which was done by owning their own network .
in *num* , ftv communications llc , a limited liability company formed by enron subsidiary firstpoint communications , inc .
, williams communications group , inc .
and touch america .
ftv constructed a *num* , *num* mile fiber optic network between portland and las vegas .
in *num* , enron constructed a building in a rundown area of las vegas near e sahara , building right over the " backbone " of fiber optic cables providing service to technology companies nationwide .
the location had the ability to send " the entire library of congress anywhere in the world within minutes " and could stream " video to the whole state of california .
" the location was also more protected from natural disasters than areas such as los angeles or the east coast .
according to " wall street daily " , " enron had a secret , " it " wanted to trade bandwidth like it traded oil , gas , electricity , etc .
it launched a secret plan to build an enormous amount of fiber optic transmission capacity in las vegas .
.
.
it was all part of enron’s plan to essentially own the internet .
" enron sought to have all us internet service providers rely on their nevada facility to supply bandwidth , which enron would sell in a fashion similar to other commodities .
in january *num* , kenneth lay and jeffrey skilling announced to analysts that they were going to open trading for their own " high-speed fiber-optic networks that form the backbone for internet traffic " .
investors quickly bought enron stock following the announcement " as they did with most things internet-related at the time " , with stock prices rising from $40 per share in january *num* to $70 per share in march , peaking at $90 in the summer of *num* .
enron executives obtained windfall gains from the rising stock prices , with a total of $924 million of stocks sold by high-level enron employees between *num* and *num* .
head of enron broadband services , kenneth rice , sold *num* million shares himself , earning about $70 million in returns .
as prices of existing fiber optic cables plummeted due to the vast oversupply of the system , with only *num* % of the *num* million miles being active wires , enron purchased the inactive " dark fibers " , expecting to buy them at low cost and then make a profit as the need for more usage by internet providers increased , with enron expecting to lease its acquired dark fibers in *num* year contracts to providers .
however , enron's accounting would use estimates to determine how much their dark fiber would be worth when " lit " and apply those estimates to their current income , adding exaggerated revenue to their accounts since transactions were not yet made and it was not known if the cables would ever be active .
enron's trading with other energy companies within the broadband market was its attempt to lure large telecommunications companies , such as verizon communications , into its broadband scheme to create its own new market .
by the second quarter of *num* , enron broadband services was reporting losses .
on march *num* , *num* , a proposed 20-year deal between enron and blockbuster inc .
to stream movies on demand over enron's connections was cancelled , with enron shares dropping from $80 per share in mid-february *num* to below $60 the week after the deal was killed .
the branch of the company that jeffrey skilling " said would eventually add $40 billion to enron's stock value " added only about $408 million in revenue for enron in *num* , with the company's broadband arm closed shortly after its meager second-quarter earnings report in july *num* .
following the bankruptcy of enron , telecommunications holdings were sold for " pennies on the dollar .
" in *num* , rob roy of switch communications purchased enron's nevada facility in an auction attended only by roy .
enron's " fiber plans were so secretive that few people even knew about the auction .
" the facility was sold for only $930 , *num* .
following the sale , switch expanded to control " the biggest data center in the world .
" enron , seeing stability after the merger , began to look overseas for new possible energy opportunities in *num* .
enron's first such opportunity was a natural gas power plant utilizing cogeneration that the company built in teesside , uk .
the power plant was so large it could produce up to *num* % of the united kingdom's electricity demand with a capacity of over *num* , *num* megawatts .
seeing the success in england , the company developed and diversified its assets worldwide under the name of enron international ( ei ) , headed by former hng executive rebecca mark .
by *num* , ei's portfolio included assets in the philippines , australia , guatemala , germany , france , india , argentina , the caribbean , china , england , colombia , turkey , bolivia , brazil , indonesia , norway , poland , and japan .
the division was becoming a large share of earnings for enron , contributing *num* % of earnings in *num* .
mark and ei believed the water industry was the next market to be deregulated by authorities and seeing the potential , searched for ways to enter the market , similar to pge .
in *num* , enron international acquired wessex water for $2 .
*num* billion .
wessex water became the core asset of a new company , azurix , which expanded to other water companies .
after azurix's promising ipo in june *num* , enron " sucked out over $1 billion in cash while loading it up with debt , " according to bethany mclean and peter elkind , authors of " " .
additionally , british water regulators required wessex to cut its rates by *num* % starting in april *num* , and an upgrade was required of the utility's aging infrastructure , estimated at costing over a billion dollars .
by the end of *num* azurix had an operating profit of less than $100 million and was $2 billion in debt .
in august *num* , after azurix stock took a plunge following its earnings report , mark resigned from azurix and enron .
azurix assets , including wessex , were eventually sold by enron .
in *num* , enron's chief operating officer jeffrey skilling hired andrew fastow , who was well acquainted with the burgeoning deregulated energy market that skilling wanted to exploit .
in *num* , fastow began establishing numerous limited liability special purpose entities ( a common business practice in the energy industry ) ; however , it also allowed enron to transfer liability so that it would not appear in its accounts , allowing it to maintain a robust and generally increasing stock price and thus keeping its critical investment grade credit ratings .
enron was originally involved in transmitting and distributing electricity and natural gas throughout the united states .
the company developed , built , and operated power plants and pipelines while dealing with rules of law and other infrastructures worldwide .
enron owned a large network of natural gas pipelines , which stretched coast to coast and border to border including northern natural gas , florida gas transmission , transwestern pipeline company and a partnership in northern border pipeline from canada .
the states of california , new hampshire , and rhode island had already passed power deregulation laws by july *num* , the time of enron's proposal to acquire portland general electric corporation .
during *num* , enron began operations in the water sector , creating the azurix corporation , which it part-floated on the new york stock exchange during june *num* .
azurix failed to become successful in the water utility market , and one of its major concessions , in buenos aires , was a large-scale money-loser .
enron grew wealthy due largely to marketing , promoting power , and its high stock price .
enron was named " america's most innovative company " by the magazine " fortune " for six consecutive years , from *num* to *num* .
it was on the " fortune"s " *num* best companies to work for in america " list during *num* , and had offices that were stunning in their opulence .
enron was hailed by many , including labor and the workforce , as an overall great company , praised for its large long-term pensions , benefits for its workers and extremely effective management until the exposure of its corporate fraud .
the first analyst to question the company's success story was daniel scotto , an energy market expert at bnp paribas , who issued a note in august *num* entitled " enron : all stressed up and no place to go " , which encouraged investors to sell enron stocks , although he only changed his recommendation on the stock from " buy " to " neutral .
" as was later discovered , many of enron's recorded assets and profits were inflated or even wholly fraudulent and nonexistent .
one example of fraudulent records was during *num* when enron promised to repay merrill lynch & co .
' s investment with interest in order to show a profit on its books .
debts and losses were put into entities formed " offshore " that were not included in the company's financial statements , and other sophisticated and arcane financial transactions between enron and related companies were used to eliminate unprofitable entities from the company's books .
the company's most valuable asset and the largest source of honest income , the 1930s-era northern natural gas company , was eventually purchased by a group of omaha investors , who relocated its headquarters back to omaha ; it is now a unit of warren buffett's berkshire hathaway energy .
nng was established as collateral for a $2 .
*num* billion capital infusion by dynegy corporation when dynegy was planning to buy enron .
when dynegy examined enron's financial records carefully , they repudiated the deal and dismissed their ceo , chuck watson .
the new chairman and ceo , the late daniel dienstbier , had been president of nng and an enron executive at one time and was forced out of enron by ken lay .
dienstbier was an acquaintance of warren buffett .
nng continues to be profitable now .
during *num* , after a series of revelations involving irregular accounting procedures bordering on fraud perpetrated throughout the 1990s involving enron and its accounting company arthur andersen , enron suffered the largest chapter *num* bankruptcy in history ( since surpassed by those of worldcom during *num* and lehman brothers during *num* ) .
as the scandal progressed , enron share prices decreased from us $90 .
*num* during the summer of *num* , to just pennies .
enron had been considered a blue chip stock investment , so this was an unprecedented event in the financial world .
enron's demise occurred after the revelation that much of its profits and revenue were the result of deals with special purpose entities ( limited partnerships which it controlled ) .
this meant that many of enron's debts and the losses that it suffered were not reported in its financial statements .
a rescue attempt by a similar , smaller energy company , dynegy , failed during late november due to concerns about an unexpected restatement of earnings .
enron filed for bankruptcy on december *num* , *num* .
in addition , the scandal caused the dissolution of arthur andersen , which at the time was one of the " big five " - the world's foremost accounting firms .
the company was found guilty of obstruction of justice during *num* for destroying documents related to the enron audit .
since the sec is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons , andersen was forced to stop auditing public companies .
although the conviction was dismissed during *num* by the supreme court , the damage to the andersen name has prevented it from reviving as a viable business even on a limited scale .
enron also withdrew a naming-rights deal with the houston astros major league baseball club to have its name associated with their new stadium , which was known formerly as enron field ( now minute maid park ) .
enron used a variety of deceptive , bewildering , and fraudulent accounting practices and tactics to cover its fraud in reporting enron's financial information .
special purpose entities were created to mask significant liabilities from enron's financial statements .
these entities made enron seem more profitable than it actually was , and created a dangerous spiral in which , each quarter , corporate officers would have to perform more and more financial deception to create the illusion of billions of dollars in profit while the company was actually losing money .
this practice increased their stock price to new levels , at which point the executives began to work on insider information and trade millions of dollars ' worth of enron stock .
the executives and insiders at enron knew about the offshore accounts that were hiding losses for the company ; the investors , however , did not .
chief financial officer andrew fastow directed the team which created the off-books companies , and manipulated the deals to provide himself , his family , and his friends with hundreds of millions of dollars in guaranteed revenue , at the expense of the corporation for which he worked and its stockholders .
during *num* , enron initiated enrononline , an internet-based trading operation , which was used by virtually every energy company in the united states .
enron president and chief operating officer jeffrey skilling began advocating a novel idea : the company didn't really need any " assets " .
by promoting the company's aggressive investment strategy , he helped make enron the biggest wholesaler of gas and electricity , trading over $27 billion per quarter .
the corporation's financial claims , however , had to be accepted at face value .
under skilling , enron adopted mark to market accounting , in which anticipated future profits from any deal were tabulated as if currently real .
thus , enron could record gains from what over time might turn out to be losses , as the company's fiscal health became secondary to manipulating its stock price on wall street during the so-called tech boom .
but when a company's success is measured by undocumented financial statements , actual balance sheets are inconvenient .
indeed , enron's unscrupulous actions were often gambles to keep the deception going and so increase the stock price .
an advancing price meant a continued infusion of investor capital on which debt-ridden enron in large part subsisted ( much like a financial " pyramid " or " ponzi scheme " ) .
attempting to maintain the illusion , skilling verbally attacked wall street analyst richard grubman , who questioned enron's unusual accounting practice during a recorded conference telephone call .
when grubman complained that enron was the only company that could not release a balance sheet along with its earnings statements , skilling replied , " well , thank you very much , we appreciate that .
.
.
asshole .
" though the comment was met with dismay and astonishment by press and public , it became an inside joke among many enron employees , mocking grubman for his perceived meddling rather than skilling's offensiveness .
when asked during his trial , skilling declared that industrial dominance and abuse was a global problem : " oh yes , yes sure , it is .
" enron initially planned to retain its three domestic pipeline companies as well as most of its overseas assets .
however , before emerging from bankruptcy , enron sold its domestic pipeline companies as crosscountry energy for $2 .
*num* billion and later sold other assets to vulcan capital management .
enron sold its last business , prisma energy , during *num* , leaving enron asset-less .
during early *num* , its name was changed to enron creditors recovery corporation .
its goal is to repay the old enron's remaining creditors and end enron's affairs .
azurix , the former water utility part of the company , remains under enron ownership , although it is currently asset-less .
it is involved in several litigations against the government of argentina claiming compensation relating to the negligence and corruption of the local governance during its management of the buenos aires water concession during *num* , which resulted in substantial amounts of debt ( approx .
$620 million ) and the eventual collapse of the branch .
soon after emerging from bankruptcy during november *num* , enron's new board of directors sued *num* financial institutions for helping lay , fastow , skilling and others hide enron's true financial condition .
the proceedings were dubbed the " megaclaims litigation .
" among the defendants were royal bank of scotland , deutsche bank and citigroup .
, enron has settled with all of the institutions , ending with citigroup .
enron was able to obtain nearly $7 .
*num* billion to distribute to its creditors as a result of the megaclaims litigation .
as of december *num* , some claim and process payments were still being distributed .
enron has been featured since its bankruptcy in popular culture , including in the simpsons episodes that ' 90s show ( homer buys enron stocks while marge chooses to keep her own microsoft stocks ) and special edna , which features a scene of an enron-themed amusement park ride .
the *num* film bee movie also featured a joke reference to a parody company of enron called " honron " ( a play on the words honey and enron ) .
the *num* book " bittersweet symphony " by rebecca mcnutt featured main character bailey kane discussing enron while remarking , " in devastation there is opportunity , you know .
" the book also mentions in passing that deceased enron executive j .
clifford baxter " tried to complain , he tried to live with it , he tried to do the right thing but nobody heard him… " the *num* documentary the corporation ( *num* film ) made frequent references to enron post-bankruptcy , calling the company a " bad apple .
" season *num* , episode #20 of the cbs crime drama television series cold case features a main character briefly mentioning that another character , randy price , is wanted by the u .
s .
securities and exchange commission for an " enron-type scandal .
" during august *num* , enron's stock price attained its greatest value of $90 .
*num* .
at this time enron executives , who possessed inside information on the hidden losses , began to sell their stock .
at the same time , the general public and enron's investors were told to buy the stock .
executives told the investors that the stock would continue to increase until it attained possibly the $130 to $140 range , while secretly unloading their shares .
as executives sold their shares , the price began to decrease .
investors were told to continue buying stock or hold steady if they already owned enron because the stock price would rebound in the near future .
kenneth lay's strategy for responding to enron's continuing problems was his demeanor .
as he did many times , lay would issue a statement or make an appearance to calm investors and assure them that enron was doing well .
in february *num* an article by bethany mclean appeared in " fortune " magazine questioning whether enron stock was overvalued .
by august *num* , *num* , enron's stock price had decreased to $42 .
many of the investors still trusted lay and believed that enron would rule the market .
they continued to buy or retain their stock as the equity value decreased .
as october ended , the stock had decreased to $15 .
many considered this a great opportunity to buy enron stock because of what lay had been telling them in the media .
lay was accused of selling more than $70 million worth of stock at this time , which he used to repay cash advances on lines of credit .
he sold another $29 million worth of stock in the open market .
also , lay's wife , linda , was accused of selling *num* , *num* shares of enron stock totaling $1 .
*num* million on november *num* , *num* .
the money earned from this sale did not go to the family but rather to charitable organizations , which had already received pledges of contributions from the foundation .
records show that mrs .
lay made the sale order sometime between *num* : *num* and *num* : *num* am .
news of enron's problems , including the millions of dollars in losses they hid , became public about *num* : *num* that morning , and the stock price soon decreased to less than one dollar .
former enron executive paula rieker was charged with criminal insider trading and sentenced to two years probation .
rieker obtained *num* , *num* enron shares for $15 .
*num* a share .
she sold that stock for $49 .
*num* a share during july *num* , a week before the public was told what she already knew about the $102 million loss .
in *num* , after the tumultuous fall of enron's external auditor , and management consultant , andersen llp , former andersen director , john m .
cunningham coined the phrase , " we have all been enroned .
" the fallout resulted in both lay and skilling being convicted of conspiracy , fraud , and insider trading .
lay died before sentencing , skilling got *num* years and *num* months and a $45 million penalty ( later reduced ) .
fastow was sentenced to six years of jail time , and lou pai settled out of court for $31 .
*num* million .
during october *num* , daniel scotto , the most renowned utility analyst on wall street , suspended his ratings on all energy companies conducting business in california because of the possibility that the companies would not receive full and adequate compensation for the deferred energy accounts used as the basis for the california deregulation plan enacted during the late 1990s .
five months later , pacific gas & electric ( pg&e ) was forced into bankruptcy .
senator phil gramm , husband of enron board member wendy gramm and also the second largest recipient of campaign contributions from enron , succeeded in legislating california's energy commodity trading deregulation .
despite warnings from prominent consumer groups which stated that this law would give energy traders too much influence over energy commodity prices , the legislation was passed during december *num* .
as the periodical public citizen reported , " because of enron's new , unregulated power auction , the company's ' wholesale services ' revenues quadrupled—- from $12 billion in the first quarter of *num* to $48 .
*num* billion in the first quarter of *num* .
" after passage of the deregulation law , california had a total of *num* stage *num* rolling blackouts declared , until federal regulators intervened during june *num* .
these blackouts occurred as a result of a poorly designed market system that was manipulated by traders and marketers , as well as from poor state management and regulatory oversight .
subsequently , enron traders were revealed as intentionally encouraging the removal of power from the market during california's energy crisis by encouraging suppliers to shut down plants to perform unnecessary maintenance , as documented in recordings made at the time .
these acts contributed to the need for rolling blackouts , which adversely affected many businesses dependent upon a reliable supply of electricity , and inconvenienced a large number of retail customers .
this scattered supply increased the price , and enron traders were thus able to sell power at premium prices , sometimes up to a factor of 20x its normal peak value .
enron traded in more than *num* different products , including the following : it was also an extensive futures trader , including sugar , coffee , grains , hogs , and other meat futures .
at the time of its bankruptcy filing during december *num* , enron was structured into seven distinct business units .
enron manufactured gas valves , circuit breakers , thermostats , and electrical equipment in venezuela by means of insela sa , a 50–50 joint venture with general electric .
enron owned three paper and pulp products companies : garden state paper , a newsprint mill ; as well as papiers stadacona and st .
aurelie timberlands .
enron had a controlling stake in the louisiana-based petroleum exploration and production company mariner energy .
enron opened enrononline , an electronic trading platform for energy commodities , on november *num* , *num* .
conceptualized by the company's european gas trading team , it was the first web-based transaction system that allowed buyers and sellers to buy , sell , and trade commodity products globally .
it allowed users to do business only with enron .
the site allowed enron to transact with participants in the global energy markets .
the main commodities offered on enrononline were natural gas and electricity , although there were *num* other products including credit derivatives , bankruptcy swaps , pulp , gas , plastics , paper , steel , metals , freight , and tv commercial time .
at its maximum , more than $6 billion worth of commodities were transacted by means of enrononline every day .
after enron's bankruptcy in late *num* , enrononline was sold to the swiss financial giant ubs .
within a year , ubs abandoned its efforts to relaunch the division , and closed it in november *num* .
enron international ( ei ) was enron's wholesale asset development and asset management business .
its primary emphasis was developing and building natural gas power plants outside north america .
enron engineering and construction company ( eecc ) was a wholly owned subsidiary of enron international , and built almost all of enron international's power plants .
unlike other business units of enron , enron international had a strong cash flow on bankruptcy filing .
enron international consisted of all of enron's foreign power projects , including ones in europe .
the company's teesside plant was one of the largest gas-fired power stations in the world , built and operated by enron from *num* , and produced *num* percent of the united kingdom's energy needs .
enron owned half of the plant's equity , with the remaining *num* per cent split between four regional electricity companies .
rebecca mark was the ceo of enron international until she resigned to manage enron's newly acquired water business , azurix , during *num* .
mark had a major role in the development of the dabhol project in india , enron's largest international endeavor .
enron international constructed power plants and pipelines across the globe .
some are presently still operating , including the massive teesside plant in england .
others , like a barge-mounted plant off puerto plata in the dominican republic , cost enron money by lawsuits and investment losses .
puerto plata was a barge-mounted power plant next to the hotel " hotelero del atlantico " .
when the plant was activated , winds blew soot from the plant onto the hotel guests ' meals , blackening their food .
the winds also blew garbage from nearby slums into the plant's water-intake system .
for some time the only solution was to hire men who would row out and push the garbage away with their paddles .
through mid-2000 the company collected a paltry $3 .
*num* million from a $95 million investment .
enron also had other investment projects in europe , south america , argentina , brazil , bolivia , colombia , mexico , jamaica , venezuela , and across the caribbean .
around *num* indian experts came to the united states to find energy investors to help with india's energy shortage problems .
during december *num* , enron finalized a 20-year power-purchase contract with the maharashtra state electricity board .
the contract allowed enron to construct a massive *num* , *num* megawatt power plant on a remote volcanic bluff south of mumbai .
construction would be completed in two phases , and enron would form the dabhol power company to help manage the plant .
the power project was the first step in a $20 billion scheme to help rebuild and stabilize india's power grid .
enron , ge ( which was selling turbines to the project ) , and bechtel ( which was actually constructing the plant ) , each contributed *num* % equity .
during *num* , when india's congress party was no longer in power , the indian government assessed the project as being excessively expensive and refused to pay for the plant and stopped construction .
the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) , the local state-owned utility , was required by contract to continue to pay enron plant maintenance charges , even if no power was purchased from the plant .
the mseb determined that it could not afford to purchase the power ( at rs .
*num* per unit kwh ) charged by enron .
the plant operator was unable to find alternate customers for dabhol power due to the absence of a free market in the regulated structure of utilities in india .
from *num* until enron's bankruptcy during *num* the company tried to revive the project and revive interest in india's need for the power plant without success .
during the summer of *num* , enron made an attempt to sell a number of enron international's assets , many of which were not sold .
the public and media believed it was unknown why enron wanted to sell these assets , suspecting it was because enron was in need of cash .
employees who worked with company assets were told in *num* that jeff skilling believed that business assets were an outdated means of company worth , and instead he wanted to build a company based on " intellectual assets " .
enron global exploration & production inc .
( egep ) was an enron subsidiary that was born from the split of domestic assets via eog resources ( formerly enron oil and gas eog ) and international assets via egep ( formerly enron oil and gas int'l , ltd eogil ) .
among the egep assets were the panna-mukta and the south tapti fields , discovered by the indian state-owned oil and natural gas corporation ( ongc ) , which operated the fields initially .
december *num* , a joint venture began between ongc ( *num* % ) , enron ( *num* % ) and reliance ( *num* % ) .
mid year of *num* , british gas ( bg ) completed the acquisition of egep's *num* % share of the panna-mukta and tapti fields for $350 million , a few months before enron filed bankruptcy .
during the mid-1990s , enron established an endowment for the enron prize for distinguished public service , awarded by rice university's baker institute to " recognize outstanding individuals for their contributions to public service " .
recipients were : greenspan , because of his position as the fed chairman , was not at liberty to accept the $10 , *num* honorarium , the $15 , *num* sculpture , nor the crystal trophy , but only accepted the " honor " of being named an enron prize recipient .
the situation was further complicated because a few days earlier , enron had filed paperwork admitting it had falsified financial statements for five years .
greenspan did not mention enron a single time during his speech .
at the ceremony , ken lay stated , " i'm looking forward to our first woman recipient .
" the next morning , it was reported in the " houston chronicle " that no decision had been made on whether the name of the prize would be changed .
*num* days after the prize was awarded to greenspan , enron declared bankruptcy .
during early *num* , enron was awarded harvard's ( in ) famous ig nobel prize for ' most creative use of imaginary numbers .
' the various former members of enron management team all refused to accept the award in person , although no reason was given at the time .
ettore ximenes ettore ximenes ( april *num* , *num* , palermo – december *num* , *num* , rome ) was an italian sculptor .
son of antonio ximenes and giulia tolentino , a sicilian noble woman , ettore ximenes initially embarked on literary studies but then took up sculpture and attended the courses at the palermo academy of fine arts .
after *num* , he continued training at the naples academy under domenico morelli and stanislao lista .
he also established a close relationship with vincenzo gemito .
he returned to palermo in *num* and won a competition for a four-year grant , which enabled him to study and open a studio for sculpture in florence .
in *num* at vienna , he exhibited " work without genius " .
in *num* at naples , he exhibited a life-size statue titled " the equilibrium " about a gymnast walking on a sphere .
he would make copies of this work in small marble and bronze statuettes .
he exhibited a stucco " christ and the adultress " and " il cuore del re ( heart of the king ) " , the latter depicting an oft-repeated story of king vittorio emanuele during one of his frequent hunts , encountering and offering charity to a peasant child .
at the *num* paris world exposition he displayed : " the brawl " and " il marmiton " .
in paris , he met with auguste rodin and jean-baptiste carpeaux .
in *num* , he also completed a life-size stucco of " il ciceruacchio " , a statue of the italian patriot angelo brunetti and his thirteen-year-old son , depicting them at the moment of their execution in *num* by austrian troops .
the cicervacchio statue , with its tinge of revolutionary zeal , did not find commissions for completing the work in marble .
he then completed a nude statue of " nanà " based on the novel by émile zola ; the statue was exhibited at the *num* salon di paris .
the next year at the paris salon , he displayed " la pesca meravigliosa " , where a fisherman rescues a bathing maiden .
returning to italy , he displayed the bust del minister giuseppe zanardelli .
at the mostra of rome , he displayed " the assassination of julius caeser " ; and at the exposition of venice , " ragazzi messi in fila " .
ximenes ' realism gave way to symbolist and neo-renaissance elements .
in addition to sculpture , he also produced illustrations for the works of edmondo de amicis published by the treves publishing house .
ximenes was involved in many of the major official monumental projects in italy from the 1880s on and devoted his energies as from *num* primarily to commissions for important public works in são paulo , kiev , new york and buenos aires .
acrylic paint acrylic paint is a fast-drying paint made of pigment suspended in acrylic polymer emulsion .
acrylic paints are water-soluble , but become water-resistant when dry .
depending on how much the paint is diluted with water , or modified with acrylic gels , mediums , or pastes , the finished acrylic painting can resemble a watercolor , a gouache or an oil painting , or have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media .
otto röhm invented acrylic resin , which was quickly transformed into acrylic paint .
as early as *num* , the first usable acrylic resin dispersion was developed by german chemical company basf , which was patented by rohm and haas .
the synthetic paint was first used in the 1940s , combining some of the properties of oil and watercolor .
between *num* and *num* , leonard bocour and sam golden invented a solution acrylic paint under the brand magna paint .
these were mineral spirit-based paints .
acrylics were made commercially available in the 1950s .
following that development , golden came up with a waterborne acrylic paint called " aquatec " .
in *num* , jose l .
gutierrez produced " politec acrylic artists ' colors " in mexico , and henry levinson of cincinnati-based permanent pigments co .
produced liquitex colors .
these two product lines were the very first acrylic emulsion artists ' paints .
water-based acrylic paints were subsequently sold as latex house paints , as latex is the technical term for a suspension of polymer microparticles in water .
interior latex house paints tend to be a combination of binder ( sometimes acrylic , vinyl , pva , and others ) , filler , pigment , and water .
exterior latex house paints may also be a co-polymer blend , but the best exterior water-based paints are *num* % acrylic , due to elasticity and other factors .
vinyl , however , costs half of what *num* % acrylic resins cost , and polyvinyl acetate ( pva ) is even cheaper , so paint companies make many different combinations of them to match the market .
soon after the water-based acrylic binders were introduced as house paints , artists and companies alike began to explore the potential of the new binders .
water-soluble artists ' acrylic paints were sold commercially by liquitex beginning in the 1950s , with modern high-viscosity paints becoming available in the early ' 60s .
in *num* , rowney ( part of daler-rowney since *num* ) was the first manufacturer to introduce artist's acrylic paints in europe , under the brand name " cryla " .
before the *ord* century , artists mixed their own paints , which allowed them to achieve the desired color and thickness , and to control the use of fillers , if any .
while suitable media and raw pigments are available for the individual production of acrylic paint , hand mixing may not be practical because of the fast drying time and other technical issues , such as the necessity to combine several polymers , as well as surfactants , plasticizers , dispersants , defoamers and stabilisers in the correct amounts and order .
acrylic painters can modify the appearance , hardness , flexibility , texture , and other characteristics of the paint surface by using acrylic mediums or simply by adding water .
watercolor and oil painters also use various mediums , but the range of acrylic mediums is much greater .
acrylics have the ability to bond to many different surfaces , and mediums can be used to modify their binding characteristics .
acrylics can be used on paper , canvas and a range of other materials , however their use on engineered woods such as medium-density fiberboard can be problematic because of the porous nature of those surfaces .
in these cases it is recommended that the surface first be sealed with an appropriate sealer .
acrylics can be applied in thin layers or washes to create effects that resemble watercolors and other water-based mediums .
they can also be used to build thick layers of paint—gel and molding paste are sometimes used to create paintings with relief features .
acrylic paints are also used in hobbies such as train , car , house , and human models .
people who make such models use acrylic paint to build facial features on dolls , or raised details on other types of models .
wet acrylic paint is easily removed from paint brushes and skin with water , whereas oil paints require the use of a hydrocarbon .
acrylic paints are the most common paints used in grattage , a surrealist technique that became popular with the advent of acrylic paint .
acrylics are used for this purpose because they easily scrape or peel from a surface .
acrylic artists ' paints may be thinned with water and used as washes in the manner of watercolor paints , but unlike watercolor the washes are not rehydratable once dry .
for this reason , acrylics do not lend themselves to the color lifting techniques of gum arabic-based watercolor paints .
acrylic paints with gloss or matte finishes are common , although a satin ( semi-matte ) sheen is most common .
some brands exhibit a range of finishes ( e .
g .
heavy-body paints from golden , liquitex , winsor & newton and daler-rowney ) ; politec acrylics are fully matte .
as with oils , pigment amounts and particle size or shape can affect the paint sheen .
matting agents can also be added during manufacture to dull the finish .
if desired , the artist can mix different media with their paints and use topcoats or varnishes to alter or unify sheen .
when dry , acrylic paint is generally non-removable from a solid surface if it adheres to the surface .
water or mild solvents do not re-solubilize it , although isopropyl alcohol can lift some fresh paint films off .
toluene and acetone can remove paint films , but they do not lift paint stains very well and are not selective .
the use of a solvent to remove paint may result in removal of all of the paint layers ( acrylic gesso , et cetera ) .
oils and warm , soapy water can remove acrylic paint from skin .
an acrylic sizing should be used to prime canvas in preparation for painting with acrylic paints , to prevent support induced discoloration ( sid ) .
acrylic paint contains surfactants that can pull up discoloration from a raw canvas , especially in transparent glazed or translucent gelled areas .
gesso alone will not stop sid ; a sizing must be applied before using a gesso .
the viscosity of acrylic can be successfully reduced by using suitable extenders that maintain the integrity of the paint film .
there are retarders to slow drying and extend " workability " time , and " flow releases " to increase color-blending ability .
commercial acrylic paints come in two grades : the vehicle and binder of oil paints is linseed oil ( or another drying oil ) , whereas acrylic paint has water as the vehicle for an emulsion ( suspension ) of acrylic polymer , which serves as the binder .
thus , oil paint is said to be " oil-based " , whereas acrylic paint is " water-based " ( or sometimes " water-borne " ) .
the main practical difference between most acrylics and oil paints is the inherent drying time .
oils allow for more time to blend colors and apply even glazes over underpaintings .
this slow-drying aspect of oil can be seen as an advantage for certain techniques , but it impedes an artist trying to work quickly .
the fast evaporation of water from regular acrylic paint films can be slowed with the use of acrylic retarders .
retarders are generally glycol or glycerin-based additives .
the addition of a retarder slows the evaporation rate of the water .
oil paints may require the use of solvents such as mineral spirits or turpentine to thin the paint and clean up .
these solvents generally have some level of toxicity and are often found objectionable .
relatively recently , water-miscible oil paints have been developed for artists ' use .
oil paint films can become increasingly yellow and brittle with time ; they lose much of their flexibility in a few decades .
additionally , the rules of " fat over lean " must be employed to ensure the paint films are durable .
oil paint has a higher pigment load than acrylic paint .
as linseed oil contains a smaller molecule than acrylic paint , oil paint is able to absorb substantially more pigment .
oil provides a refractive index that is less clear than acrylic dispersions , which imparts a unique " look and feel " to the resultant paint film .
not all the pigments of oil paints are available in acrylics and vice versa , as each medium has different chemical sensitivities .
some historical pigments are alkali sensitive , and therefore cannot be made in an acrylic emulsion ; others are just too difficult to formulate .
approximate " hue " color formulations , that do not contain the historical pigments , are typically offered as substitutes .
due to acrylic paint's more flexible nature and more consistent drying time between layers , an artist does not have to follow the same rules of oil painting , where more medium must be applied to each layer to avoid cracking .
it usually takes 15–20 minutes for one to two layers of acrylic paint to dry .
although canvas needs to be properly primed before painting with oil to prevent it from eventually rotting the canvas , acrylic can be safely applied straight to the canvas .
the rapid drying of acrylic paint tends to discourage blending of color and use of wet-in-wet technique as in oil painting .
even though acrylic retarders can slow drying time to several hours , it remains a relatively fast-drying medium and adding too much acrylic retarder can prevent the paint from ever drying properly .
meanwhile , acrylic paint is very elastic , which prevents cracking from occurring .
acrylic paint's binder is acrylic polymer emulsion – as this binder dries , the paint remains flexible .
another difference between oil and acrylic paints is the versatility offered by acrylic paints .
acrylics are very useful in mixed media , allowing the use of pastel ( oil and chalk ) , charcoal and pen ( among others ) on top of the dried acrylic painted surface .
mixing other bodies into the acrylic is possible—sand , rice , and even pasta may be incorporated in the artwork .
mixing artist or student grade acrylic paint with household acrylic emulsions is possible , allowing the use of premixed tints straight from the tube or tin , and thereby presenting the painter with a vast color range at their disposal .
this versatility is also illustrated by the variety of additional artistic uses for acrylics .
specialized acrylics have been manufactured and used for linoblock printing ( acrylic block printing ink has been produced by derivan since the early 1980s ) , face painting , airbrushing , watercolor-like techniques , and fabric screen printing .
another difference between oil and acrylic paint is the cleanup .
acrylic paint can be cleaned out of a brush with any soap , while oil paint needs a specific type to be sure to get all the oil out of the brushes .
also , it is easier to let a palette with oil paint dry and then scrape the paint off , whereas one can easily clean wet acrylic paint with water .
demographics of bosnia and herzegovina this article is about the demographic features of the population of bosnia and herzegovina , including population density , ethnicity , education level , health of the populace , economic status , religious affiliations and other aspects of the population .
births deaths natural growth according to data from the *num* census published by the agency for statistics of bosnia and herzegovina , bosniaks constitute *num* .
*num* % of the population , bosnian serbs *num* .
*num* % , bosnian croats *num* .
*num* % , and others form *num* .
*num* % , with the remaining respondents not declaring their ethnicity or not answering .
the census results are contested by the republika srpska statistical office and by bosnian serb politicians , who oppose the inclusion of non-permanent bosnian residents in the figures .
the european union's statistics office , eurostat , determined that the methodology used by the bosnian statistical agency was in line with international recommendations .
in bosnia and herzegovina , religion is often linked to ethnicity , i .
e .
( with the exception of agnostics and atheists ) most bosniaks are muslim , serbs are orthodox christian , and croats are roman catholic .
bosnia's constitution does not specify any official languages ; however , academics hilary footitt and michael kelly note that the dayton agreement states that it is " done in bosnian , croatian , english and serbian " , and they describe this as the " de facto recognition of three official languages " at the state level .
the equal status of bosnian , serbian and croatian was verified by the constitutional court in *num* .
it ruled that the provisions of the federation and republika srpska constitutions on language were incompatible with the state constitution , since they only recognised " bosniak " and croatian ( in the case of the federation ) and serbian ( in the case of republika srpska ) as official languages at the entity level .
as a result , the wording of the entity constitutions was changed and all three languages were made official in both entities .
the three languages are mutually intelligible and are also known collectively as serbo-croatian .
use of one of the three varieties has become a marker of ethnic identity .
michael kelly and catherine baker argue : " the three official languages of today's bosnian state .
.
.
represent the symbolic assertion of national identity over the pragmatism of mutual intelligibility " .
all standard varieties are based on the ijekavian varieties of the shtokavian dialect ( non-standard spoken varieties including , beside ijekavian , also ikavian shtokavian ) .
serbian and bosnian are written in both latin and cyrillic ( the latter predominantly using the latin script ) , whereas croatian is written only in latin alphabet .
there are also some speakers of italian , german , turkish and ladino .
yugoslav sign language is used with croatian and serbian variants .
according to the results of the *num* census , *num* .
*num* % of the population consider their mother tongue to be bosnian , *num* .
*num* % serbian , *num* .
*num* % croatian and *num* .
*num* % another language , with *num* .
*num* % not giving an answer .
according to the *num* census , *num* .
*num* % of the population identify religiously as muslim , *num* .
*num* % as serbian orthodox christian , *num* .
*num* % as roman catholic , *num* .
*num* % as other , *num* .
*num* % as agnostic or atheist , with the remainder not declaring their religion or not answering .
a *num* survey found that *num* % of bosnia's muslims are non-denominational muslims , while *num* % follow sunnism .
in bosnia and herzegovina religion is strongly linked to ethnicity .
the following demographic statistics are from the cia world factbook , unless otherwise indicated .
chalcogen the chalcogens ( ) are the chemical elements in group *num* of the periodic table .
this group is also known as the oxygen family .
it consists of the elements oxygen ( o ) , sulfur ( s ) , selenium ( se ) , tellurium ( te ) , and the radioactive element polonium ( po ) .
the chemically uncharacterized synthetic element livermorium ( lv ) is predicted to be a chalcogen as well .
often , oxygen is treated separately from the other chalcogens , sometimes even excluded from the scope of the term " chalcogen " altogether , due to its very different chemical behavior from sulfur , selenium , tellurium , and polonium .
the word " chalcogen " is derived from a combination of the greek word " khalkόs " ( χαλκός ) principally meaning copper ( the term was also used for bronze / brass , any metal in the poetic sense , ore or coin ) , and the latinised greek word " genēs " , meaning " born " or " produced " .
sulfur has been known since antiquity , and oxygen was recognized as an element in the *ord* century .
selenium , tellurium and polonium were discovered in the *ord* century , and livermorium in *num* .
all of the chalcogens have six valence electrons , leaving them two electrons short of a full outer shell .
their most common oxidation states are −2 , +2 , +4 , and +6 .
they have relatively low atomic radii , especially the lighter ones .
lighter chalcogens are typically nontoxic in their elemental form , and are often critical to life , while the heavier chalcogens are typically toxic .
all of the chalcogens have some role in biological functions , either as a nutrient or a toxin .
the lighter chalcogens , such as oxygen and sulfur , are rarely toxic and usually helpful in their pure form .
selenium is an important nutrient but is also commonly toxic .
tellurium often has unpleasant effects ( although some organisms can use it ) , and polonium is always extremely harmful , both in its chemical toxicity and its radioactivity .
sulfur has more than *num* allotropes , oxygen has nine , selenium has at least five , polonium has two , and only one crystal structure of tellurium has so far been discovered .
there are numerous organic chalcogen compounds .
not counting oxygen , organic sulfur compounds are generally the most common , followed by organic selenium compounds and organic tellurium compounds .
this trend also occurs with chalcogen pnictides and compounds containing chalcogens and carbon group elements .
oxygen is generally extracted from air and sulfur is extracted from oil and natural gas .
selenium and tellurium are produced as byproducts of copper refining .
polonium and livermorium are most available in particle accelerators .
the primary use of elemental oxygen is in steelmaking .
sulfur is mostly converted into sulfuric acid , which is heavily used in the chemical industry .
selenium's most common application is glassmaking .
tellurium compounds are mostly used in optical disks , electronic devices , and solar cells .
some of polonium's applications are due to its radioactivity .
chalcogens show similar patterns in electron configuration , especially in the outermost shells , where they all have the same number of valence electrons , resulting in similar trends in chemical behavior : all chalcogens have six valence electrons .
all of the solid , stable chalcogens are soft and do not conduct heat well .
electronegativity decreases towards the chalcogens with higher atomic numbers .
density , melting and boiling points , and atomic and ionic radii tend to increase towards the chalcogens with higher atomic numbers .
out of the six known chalcogens , one ( oxygen ) has an atomic number equal to a nuclear magic number , which means that their atomic nuclei tend to have increased stability towards radioactive decay .
oxygen has three stable isotopes , and *num* unstable ones .
sulfur has four stable isotopes , *num* radioactive ones , and one isomer .
selenium has six observationally stable or nearly stable isotopes , *num* radioactive isotopes , and *num* isomers .
tellurium has eight stable or nearly stable isotopes , *num* unstable ones , and *num* isomers .
polonium has *num* isotopes , none of which are stable .
it has an additional *num* isomers .
in addition to the stable isotopes , some radioactive chalcogen isotopes occur in nature , either because they are decay products , such as po , because they are primordial , such as se , because of cosmic ray spallation , or via nuclear fission of uranium .
livermorium isotopes *num* through *num* have been discovered .
the most stable livermorium isotope is lv , which has a half-life of *num* .
*num* seconds .
among the lighter chalcogens ( oxygen and sulfur ) , the most neutron-poor isotopes undergo proton emission , the moderately neutron-poor isotopes undergo electron capture or β decay , the moderately neutron-rich isotopes undergo β decay , and the most neutron rich isotopes undergo neutron emission .
the middle chalcogens ( selenium and tellurium ) have similar decay tendencies as the lighter chalcogens , but their isotopes do not undergo proton emission and some of the most neutron-starved isotopes of tellurium undergo alpha decay .
polonium's isotopes tend to decay with alpha or beta decay .
isotopes with nuclear spins are more common among the chalcogens selenium and tellurium than they are with sulfur .
oxygen's most common allotrope is diatomic oxygen , or o , a reactive paramagnetic molecule that is ubiquitous to aerobic organisms and has a blue color in its liquid state .
another allotrope is o , or ozone , which is three oxygen atoms bonded together in a bent formation .
there is also an allotrope called tetraoxygen , or o , and six allotropes of solid oxygen including " red oxygen " , which has the formula o .
sulfur has over *num* known allotropes , which is more than any other element except carbon .
the most common allotropes are in the form of eight-atom rings , but other molecular allotropes that contain as few as two atoms or as many as *num* are known .
other notable sulfur allotropes include rhombic sulfur and monoclinic sulfur .
rhombic sulfur is the more stable of the two allotropes .
monoclinic sulfur takes the form of long needles and is formed when liquid sulfur is cooled to slightly below its melting point .
the atoms in liquid sulfur are generally in the form of long chains , but above 190° celsius , the chains begin to break down .
if liquid sulfur above 190°celsius is frozen very rapidly , the resulting sulfur is amorphous or " plastic " sulfur .
gaseous sulfur is a mixture of diatomic sulfur ( s ) and 8-atom rings .
selenium has at least five known allotropes .
the gray allotrope , commonly referred to as the " metallic " allotrope , despite not being a metal , is stable and has a hexagonal crystal structure .
the gray allotrope of selenium is soft , with a mohs hardness of *num* , and brittle .
the four other allotropes of selenium are metastable .
these include two monoclinic red allotropes and two amorphous allotropes , one of which is red and one of which is black .
the red allotrope converts to the red allotrope in the presence of heat .
the gray allotrope of selenium is made from spirals on selenium atoms , while one of the red allotropes is made of stacks of selenium rings ( se ) .
tellurium is not known to have any allotropes , although its typical form is hexagonal .
polonium has two allotropes , which are known as α-polonium and β-polonium .
α-polonium has a cubic crystal structure and converts to the rhombohedral β-polonium at *num* °c .
the chalcogens have varying crystal structures .
oxygen's crystal structure is monoclinic , sulfur's is orthorhombic , selenium and tellurium have the hexagonal crystal structure , while polonium has a cubic crystal structure .
oxygen , sulfur , and selenium are nonmetals , and tellurium is a metalloid , meaning that its chemical properties are between those of a metal and those of a nonmetal .
it is not certain whether polonium is a metal or a metalloid .
some sources refer to polonium as a metalloid , although it has some metallic properties .
also , some allotropes of selenium display characteristics of a metalloid , even though selenium is usually considered a nonmetal .
even though oxygen is a chalcogen , its chemical properties are different from those of other chalcogens .
one reason for this is that the heavier chalcogens have vacant d-orbitals .
oxygen's electronegativity is also much higher than those of the other chalcogens .
this makes oxygen's electric polarizability several times lower than those of the other chalcogens .
the oxidation number of the most common chalcogen compounds with positive metals is −2 .
however the tendency for chalcogens to form compounds in the −2 state decreases towards the heavier chalcogens .
other oxidation numbers , such as −1 in pyrite and peroxide , do occur .
the highest formal oxidation number is +6 .
this oxidation number is found in sulfates , selenates , tellurates , polonates , and their corresponding acids , such as sulfuric acid .
oxygen is the most electronegative element except for fluorine , and forms compounds with almost all of the chemical elements , including some of the noble gases .
it commonly bonds with many metals and metalloids to form oxides , including iron oxide , titanium oxide , and silicon oxide .
oxygen's most common oxidation state is −2 , and the oxidation state −1 is also relatively common .
with hydrogen it forms water and hydrogen peroxide .
organic oxygen compounds are ubiquitous in organic chemistry .
sulfur's oxidation states are −2 , +2 , +4 , and +6 .
sulfur-containing analogs of oxygen compounds often have the prefix " thio- " .
sulfur's chemistry is similar to oxygen's , in many ways .
one difference is that sulfur-sulfur double bonds are far weaker than oxygen-oxygen double bonds , but sulfur-sulfur single bonds are stronger than oxygen-oxygen single bonds .
organic sulfur compounds such as thiols have a strong specific smell , and a few are utilized by some organisms .
selenium's oxidation states are −2 , +4 , and +6 .
selenium , like most chalcogens , bonds with oxygen .
there are some organic selenium compounds , such as selenoproteins .
tellurium's oxidation states are −2 , +2 , +4 , and +6 .
tellurium forms the oxides tellurium monoxide , tellurium dioxide , and tellurium trioxide .
polonium's oxidation states are +2 and +4 .
there are many acids containing chalcogens , including sulfuric acid , sulfurous acid , selenic acid , and telluric acid .
all hydrogen chalcogenides are toxic except for water .
oxygen ions often come in the forms of oxide ions ( ) , peroxide ions ( ) , and hydroxide ions ( ) .
sulfur ions generally come in the form of sulfides ( ) , sulfites ( ) , sulfates ( ) , and thiosulfates ( ) .
selenium ions usually come in the form of selenides ( ) and selenates ( ) .
tellurium ions often come in the form of tellurates ( ) .
molecules containing metal bonded to chalcogens are common as minerals .
for example , pyrite ( fes ) is an iron ore , and the rare mineral calaverite is the ditelluride ( au , ag ) te .
although all group *num* elements of the periodic table , including oxygen , can be defined as chalcogens , oxygen and oxides are usually distinguished from chalcogens and chalcogenides .
the term " chalcogenide " is more commonly reserved for sulfides , selenides , and tellurides , rather than for oxides .
except for polonium , the chalcogens are all fairly similar to each other chemically .
they all form x ions when reacting with electropositive metals .
sulfide minerals and analogous compounds produce gases upon reaction with oxygen .
chalcogens also form compounds with halogens known as chalcohalides .
such compounds are known as chalcogen halides .
the majority of simple chalcogen halides are well-known and widely used as chemical reagents .
however , more complicated chalcogen halides , such as sulfenyl , sulfonyl , and sulfuryl halides , are less well known to science .
out of the compounds consisting purely of chalcogens and halogens , there are a total of *num* chalcogen fluorides , nine chalcogen chlorides , eight chalcogen bromides , and six chalcogen iodides that are known .
the heavier chalcogen halides often have significant molecular interactions .
sulfur fluorides with low valences are fairly unstable and little is known about their properties .
however , sulfur fluorides with high valences , such as sulfur hexafluoride , are stable and well-known .
sulfur tetrafluoride is also a well-known sulfur fluoride .
certain selenium fluorides , such as selenium difluoride , have been produced in small amounts .
the crystal structures of both selenium tetrafluoride and tellurium tetrafluoride are known .
chalcogen chlorides and bromides have also been explored .
in particular , selenium dichloride and sulfur dichloride can react to form organic selenium compounds .
dichalcogen dihalides , such as secl also are known to exist .
there are also mixed chalcogen-halogen compounds .
these include sesx , with x being chlorine or bromine .
such compounds can form in mixtures of sulfur dichloride and selenium halides .
these compounds have been fairly recently structurally characterized , as of *num* .
in general , diselenium and disulfur chlorides and bromides are useful chemical reagents .
chalcogen halides with attached metal atoms are soluble in organic solutions .
one example of such a compound is moscl .
unlike selenium chlorides and bromides , selenium iodides have not been isolated , as of *num* , although it is likely that they occur in solution .
diselenium diiodide , however , does occur in equilibrium with selenium atoms and iodine molecules .
some tellurium halides with low valences , such as tecl and tebr , form polymers when in the solid state .
these tellurium halides can be synthesized by the reduction of pure tellurium with superhydride and reacting the resulting product with tellurium tetrahalides .
ditellurium dihalides tend to get less stable as the halides become lower in atomic number and atomic mass .
tellurium also forms iodides with even fewer iodine atoms than diiodies .
these include tei and tei .
these compounds have extended structures in the solid state .
halogens and chalcogens can also form halochalcogenate anions .
alcohols , phenols and other similar compounds contain oxygen .
however , in thiols , selenols and tellurols ; sulfur , selenium , and tellurium replace oxygen .
thiols are better known than selenols or tellurols .
thiols are the most stable chalcogenols and tellurols are the least stable , being unstable in heat or light .
other organic chalcogen compounds include thioethers , selenoethers and telluroethers .
some of these , such as dimethyl sulfide , diethyl sulfide , and dipropyl sulfide are commercially available .
selenoethers are in the form of rse or rser .
telluroethers such as dimethyl telluride are typically prepared in the same way as thioethers and selenoethers .
organic chalcogen compounds , especially organic sulfur compounds , have the tendency to smell unpleasant .
dimethyl telluride also smells unpleasant , and selenophenol is renowned for its " metaphysical stench " .

compounds with chalcogen-phosphorus bonds have been explored for more than *num* years .
these compounds include unsophisticated phosphorus chalcogenides as well as large molecules with biological roles and phosphorus-chalcogen compounds with metal clusters .
these compounds have numerous applications , including strike-anywhere matches and quantum dots .
a total of *num* , *num* compounds with at least one phosphorus-sulfur bond , *num* compounds with at least one phosphorus-selenium bond , and *num* compounds with at least one phosphorus-tellurium bond have been discovered .
the decrease in the number of chalcogen-phosphorus compounds further down the periodic table is due to diminishing bond strength .
such compounds tend at least one phosphorus atom in the center , surrounded by four chalcogens and side chains .
however , some phosphorus-chalcogen compounds also contain hydrogen ( such as secondary phosphine chalcogenides ) or nitrogen ( such as dichalcogenoimidodiphosphates ) .
phosphorus selenides are typically harder to handle that phosphorus sulfides , and compounds in the form pte have not been discovered .
chalcogens also bond with other pnictogens , such as arsenic , antimony , and bismuth .
heavier chalcogen pnictides tend to form ribbon-like polymers instead of individual molecules .

almost all chalcogen pnictide salts are typically in the form of [ pne ] , where pn is a pnictogen and e is a chalcogen .
tertiary phosphines can react with chalcogens to form compounds in the form of rpe , where e is a chalcogen .
when e is sulfur , these compounds are relatively stable , but they are less so when e is selenium or tellurium .
similarly , secondary phosphines can react with chalcogens to form secondary phosphine chalcogenides .

in some cases this occurs with chalcogens bonding with two hydrogen atoms .
however tellurium hydride and polonium hydride are both volatile and highly labile .

one such chalcogen boride consists of two molecules of dimethyl sulfide attached to a boron-hydrogen molecule .
other important boron-chalcogen compounds include macropolyhedral systems .
such compounds tend to feature sulfur as the chalcogen .
there are also chalcogen borides with two , three , or four chalcogens .
many of these contain sulfur but some , such as nabse contain selenium instead .
sulfur has been known since ancient times and is mentioned in the bible fifteen times .
it was known to the ancient greeks and commonly mined by the ancient romans .
it was also historically used as a component of greek fire .
in the middle ages , it was a key part of alchemical experiments .
in the 1700s and 1800s , scientists joseph louis gay-lussac and louis-jacques thénard proved sulfur to be a chemical element .
early attempts to separate oxygen from air were hampered by the fact that air was thought of as a single element up to the *ord* and *ord* centuries .
robert hooke , mikhail lomonosov , ole borch , and pierre bayden all successfully created oxygen , but did not realize it at the time .
oxygen was discovered by joseph priestley in *num* when he focused sunlight on a sample of mercuric oxide and collected the resulting gas .
carl wilhelm scheele had also created oxygen in *num* by the same method , but scheele did not publish his results until *num* .
tellurium was first discovered in *num* by franz joseph müller von reichenstein .
he discovered tellurium in a sample of what is now known as calaverite .
müller assumed at first that the sample was pure antimony , but tests he ran on the sample did not agree with this .
muller then guessed that the sample was bismuth sulfide , but tests confirmed that the sample was not that .
for some years , muller pondered the problem .
eventually he realized that the sample was gold bonded with an unknown element .
in *num* , müller sent part of the sample to the german chemist martin klaproth , who purified the undiscovered element .
klaproth decided to call the element tellurium after the latin word for earth .
selenium was discovered in *num* by jöns jacob berzelius .
berzelius noticed a reddish-brown sediment at a sulfuric acid manufacturing plant .
the sample was thought to contain arsenic .
berzelius initially thought that the sediment contained tellurium , but came to realize that it also contained a new element , which he named selenium after the greek moon goddess selene .
three of the chalcogens ( sulfur , selenium , and tellurium ) were part of the discovery of periodicity , as they are among a series of triads of elements in the same group that were noted by johann wolfgang döbereiner as having similar properties .
around *num* john newlands produced a series of papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar physical and chemical properties that recurred at intervals of eight ; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music .
his version included a " group b " consisting of oxygen , sulfur , selenium , tellurium , and osmium .
after *num* , dmitri mendeleev proposed his periodic table placing oxygen at the top of " group vi " above sulfur , selenium , and tellurium .
chromium , molybdenum , tungsten , and uranium were sometimes included in this group , but they would be later rearranged as part of group vib ; uranium would later be moved to the actinide series .
oxygen , along with sulfur , selenium , tellurium , and later polonium would be grouped in " group via " , until the group's name was changed to " group *num* " in *num* .
in the late *ord* century , marie curie and pierre curie discovered that a sample of pitchblende was emitting four times as much radioactivity as could be explained by the presence of uranium alone .
the curies gathered several tons of pitchblende and refined it for several months until they had a pure sample of polonium .
the discovery officially took place in *num* .
prior to the invention of particle accelerators , the only way to create polonium was to extract it over several months from uranium ore .
the first attempt at creating livermorium was from *num* to *num* at the lbnl , who bombarded curium-248 with calcium-48 , but were not successful .
after several failed attempts in *num* , *num* , and *num* by research groups in russia , germany , and the us , livermorium was created successfully in *num* at the joint institute for nuclear research by bombarding curium-248 atoms with calcium-48 atoms .
the element was known as ununhexium until it was officially named livermorium in *num* .
in the *ord* century , jons jacob berzelius suggested calling the elements in group *num* " amphigens " , as the elements in the group formed amphid salts ( salts of oxyacids ) the term received some use in the early 1800s but is now obsolete .
the name " chalcogen " comes from the greek words " χαλκος " ( chalkos , literally " copper " ) , and " γενές " ( genes , born , gender , kindle ) .
it was first used in *num* by wilhelm biltz's group at the university of hanover , where it was proposed by werner fischer .
the word " chalcogen " gained popularity in germany during the 1930s because the term was analogous to " halogen " .
although the literal meanings of the greek words imply that " chalcogen " means " copper-former " , this is misleading because the chalcogens have nothing to do with copper in particular .
" ore-former " has been suggested as a better translation , as the vast majority of metal ores are chalcogenides and the word " χαλκος " in ancient greek was associated with metals and metal-bearing rock in general ; copper , and its alloy bronze , was one of the first metals to be used by humans .
oxygen's name comes from the greek words " oxy genes " , meaning " acid-forming " .
sulfur's name comes from either the latin word " sulfurium " or the sanskrit word " sulvere " ; both of those terms are ancient words for sulfur .
selenium is named after the greek goddess of the moon , selene , to match the previously-discovered element tellurium , whose name comes from the latin word " telus " , meaning earth .
polonium is named after marie curie's country of birth , poland .
livermorium is named for the lawrence livermore national laboratory .
the four lightest chalcogens ( oxygen , sulfur , selenium , and tellurium ) are all primordial elements on earth .

livermorium is always produced artificially in particle accelerators .
even when it is produced , only a small number of atoms at a time are synthesized .
chalcophile elements are those that remain on or close to the surface because they combine readily with chalcogens other than oxygen , forming compounds which do not sink into the core .
chalcophile ( " chalcogen-loving " ) elements in this context are those metals and heavier nonmetals that have a low affinity for oxygen and prefer to bond with the heavier chalcogen sulfur as sulfides .
because sulfide minerals are much denser than the silicate minerals formed by lithophile elements , chalcophile elements separated below the lithophiles at the time of the first crystallisation of the earth's crust .
this has led to their depletion in the earth's crust relative to their solar abundances , though this depletion has not reached the levels found with siderophile elements .
approximately *num* million metric tons of oxygen are produced yearly .

eris ( mythology ) eris ( ; , " strife " ) is the greek goddess of strife and discord .
her name is the equivalent of latin discordia , which means " discord " .
eris ' greek opposite is harmonia , whose latin counterpart is concordia .
homer equated her with the war-goddess enyo , whose roman counterpart is bellona .
the dwarf planet eris is named after the goddess .
"eris " is of uncertain etymology ; connections with the verb ὀρίνειν " orinein " , " to raise , stir , excite , " and the proper name ἐρινύες " erinyes " have been suggested .
r .
s .
p .
beekes rejects these derivations and suggested a pre-greek origin .
in hesiod's " works and days " 11–24 , two different goddesses named eris are distinguished : , after all , there was not one kind of strife alone , but all over the earth there are two .
as for the one , a man would praise her when he came to understand her ; but the other is blameworthy : and they are wholly different in nature .
for one fosters evil war and battle , being cruel : her no man loves ; but perforce , through the will of the deathless gods , men pay harsh strife her honour due .
but the other is the elder daughter of dark night ( nyx ) , and the son of cronus who sits above and dwells in the aether , set her in the roots of the earth : and she is far kinder to men .
she stirs up even the shiftless to toil ; for a man grows eager to work when he considers his neighbour , a rich man who hastens to plough and plant and put his house in good order ; and neighbour vies with his neighbour as he hurries after wealth .
this strife is wholesome for men .
and potter is angry with potter , and craftsman with craftsman and beggar is jealous of beggar , and minstrel of minstrel .
/ in hesiod's " theogony " ( 226–232 ) , strife , the daughter of night , is less kindly spoken of as she brings forth other personifications as her children : the other strife is presumably she who appears in homer's " iliad " book iv ; equated with enyo as sister of ares and so presumably daughter of zeus and hera : strife whose wrath is relentless , she is the sister and companion of murderous ares , she who is only a little thing at the first , but thereafter grows until she strides on the earth with her head striking heaven .
she then hurled down bitterness equally between both sides as she walked through the onslaught making men's pain heavier .
she also has a son whom she named strife .
enyo is mentioned in book *num* , and zeus sends strife to rouse the achaeans in book *num* , of the same work .
the most famous tale of eris recounts her initiating the trojan war by causing the judgement of paris .
the goddesses hera , athena and aphrodite had been invited along with the rest of olympus to the forced wedding of peleus and thetis , who would become the parents of achilles , but eris had been snubbed because of her troublemaking inclinations .
she therefore ( as mentioned at the " kypria " according to proclus as part of a plan hatched by zeus and themis ) tossed into the party the apple of discord , a golden apple inscribed – " for the most beautiful one " , or " to the fairest one" – provoking the goddesses to begin quarreling about the appropriate recipient .
the hapless paris , prince of troy , was appointed to select the fairest by zeus .
the goddesses stripped naked to try to win paris ' decision , and also attempted to bribe him .
hera offered political power ; athena promised infinite wisdom ; and aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world : helen , wife of menelaus of sparta .
while greek culture placed a greater emphasis on prowess and power , paris chose to award the apple to aphrodite , thereby dooming his city , which was destroyed in the war that ensued .
in nonnus ' " dionysiaca " , *num* .
*num* , when typhon prepares to battle with zeus : eris ( " strife " ) was typhon's escort in the melée , nike ( " victory " ) led zeus to battle .
another story of eris includes hera , and the love of polytekhnos and aedon .
they claimed to love each other more than hera and zeus were in love .
this angered hera , so she sent eris to wreak discord upon them .
polytekhnos was finishing off a chariot board , and aedon a web she had been weaving .
eris said to them , " whosoever finishes thine task last shall have to present the other with a female servant ! " aedon won .
but polytekhnos was not happy by his defeat , so he came to khelidon , aedon's sister , and raped her .
he then disguised her as a slave , presenting her to aedon .
when aedon discovered this was indeed her sister , she chopped up polytekhnos ' son and fed him to polytekhnos .
the gods were not pleased , so they turned them all into birds .
eris has been adopted as the patron deity of the modern discordian religion , which was begun in the late 1950s by gregory hill and kerry wendell thornley under the pen names of " malaclypse the younger " and " omar khayyam ravenhurst " .
the discordian version of eris is considerably lighter in comparison to the rather malevolent graeco-roman original , wherein she is depicted as a positive ( albeit mischievous ) force of chaotic creation .
a quote from the " principia discordia " , the first holy book of discordianism , attempts to clear up the matter : the story of eris being snubbed and indirectly starting the trojan war is recorded in the " principia " , and is referred to as the original snub .
the " principia discordia " states that her parents may be as described in greek legend , or that she may be the daughter of void .
she is the goddess of disorder and being , whereas her sister aneris ( called the equivalent of harmonia by the mythics of harmonia ) is the goddess of order and non-being .
their brother is spirituality .
discordian eris is looked upon as a foil to the preoccupation of western philosophy in attempting find order in the chaos of reality , in prescribing order to be synonymous with truth .
discordian eris teaches us that the only truth is chaos , and that order and disorder are simply temporary filters applied to the lenses we view the chaos through .
this is known as the aneristic illusion .
in this telling , eris becomes something of a patron saint of chaotic creation : the concept of eris as developed by the " principia discordia " is used and expanded upon in the science fiction work " the illuminatus ! trilogy " by robert shea and robert anton wilson ( in which characters from " principia discordia " appear ) .
in this work , eris is a major character .
the classic fairy tale " sleeping beauty " is partly inspired by eris ' role in the wedding of peleus and thetis .
like eris , a malevolent fairy curses a princess after not being invited to the princess ' christening .
ellipse in mathematics , an ellipse is a curve in a plane surrounding two focal points such that the sum of the distances to the two focal points is constant for every point on the curve .
as such , it is a generalization of a circle , which is a special type of an ellipse having both focal points at the same location .
the elongation of an ellipse is represented by its eccentricity , which for an ellipse can be any number from *num* ( the limiting case of a circle ) to arbitrarily close to but less than *num* .
ellipses are the closed type of conic section : a plane curve resulting from the intersection of a cone by a plane ( see figure to the right ) .
ellipses have many similarities with the other two forms of conic sections : parabolas and hyperbolas , both of which are open and unbounded .
the cross section of a cylinder is an ellipse , unless the section is parallel to the axis of the cylinder .
analytically , an ellipse may also be defined as the set of points such that the ratio of the distance of each point on the curve from a given point ( called a focus or focal point ) to the distance from that same point on the curve to a given line ( called the directrix ) is a constant .
this ratio is the above-mentioned eccentricity of the ellipse .
an ellipse may also be defined analytically as the set of points for each of which the sum of its distances to two foci is a fixed number .
ellipses are common in physics , astronomy and engineering .
for example , the orbit of each planet in the solar system is approximately an ellipse with the barycenter of the planetsun pair at one of the focal points .
the same is true for moons orbiting planets and all other systems having two astronomical bodies .
the shapes of planets and stars are often well described by ellipsoids .
ellipses also arise as images of a circle under parallel projection and the bounded cases of perspective projection , which are simply intersections of the projective cone with the plane of projection .
it is also the simplest lissajous figure formed when the horizontal and vertical motions are sinusoids with the same frequency .
a similar effect leads to elliptical polarization of light in optics .
the name , ( , " omission " ) , was given by apollonius of perga in his " conics " , emphasizing the connection of the curve with " application of areas " .
an ellipse can be defined geometrically as a set of points ( locus of points ) in the euclidean plane : the midpoint formula_13 of the line segment joining the foci is called the center of the ellipse .
the line through the foci is called the major axis , and the line perpendicular to it through the center is called the minor axis .
the major axis contains the vertices formula_14 , which have distance formula_11 to the center .
the distance formula_16 of the foci to the center is called the focal distance or linear eccentricity .
the quotient formula_17 is the eccentricity formula_18 .
the case formula_19 yields a circle and is included .
the equation formula_20 can be viewed in a different way ( see picture ) : if formula_21 is the circle with midpoint formula_2 and radius formula_3 , then the distance of a point formula_7 to the circle formula_21 equals the distance to the focus formula_1 : formula_21 is called the circular directrix ( related to focus formula_2 ) of the ellipse .
this property should not be confused with the definition of an ellipse with help of a directrix ( line ) below .
using dandelin spheres one can prove that any " plane section of a cone " with a plane , which does not contain the apex and whose slope is less than the slope of the lines on the cone , is an ellipse .
if cartesian coordinates are introduced such that the origin is the center of the ellipse and the " x"-axis is the major axis and for an arbitrary point formula_32 the distance to the focus formula_33 is formula_34 and to the second focus formula_35 .
hence the point formula_32 is on the ellipse if the following condition is fulfilled remove the square roots by suitable squarings and use the relation formula_38 to obtain the equation of the ellipse : or , solved for " y " , the shape parameters formula_41 are called the semi-major and semi-minor axes .
the points formula_42 are the " co-vertices " .
it follows from the equation that the ellipse is " symmetric " with respect to both of the coordinate axes and hence symmetric with respect to the origin .
the eccentricity of an ellipse can be expressed in terms of the ratio of semi-minor and semi-major axes as this definition relies on the major axis of an ellipse not being shorter than its minor axis ellipses with equal axes are simply circles , that is , ellipses with zero eccentricity .
the degree of " flatness " of ellipses increases as their eccentricity does .
the length of the chord through one of the foci , which is perpendicular to the major axis of the ellipse is called the " latus rectum " .
one half of it is the " semi-latus rectum " formula_44 .
a calculation shows the semi-latus rectum formula_44 may also be viewed as the " radius of curvature " of the osculating circles at the vertices on the major axis .
an arbitrary line formula_47 intersects an ellipse at " *num* , *num* or *num* " points .
in the first case the line is called " exterior line " , in the second case " tangent " and " secant " in the third case .
through any point of an ellipse there is exactly " one " tangent .
proof : let be formula_48 an ellipse point and formula_54 the vector equation of a line formula_47 ( containing formula_48 ) .
inserting the line's equation into the ellipse equation and respecting formula_57 yields : in case of formula_59 line formula_47 and the ellipse have only point formula_48 in common and formula_47 is a " tangent " .
the tangent direction is orthogonal to vector formula_63 which is then a normal vector of the tangent and the tangent has the equation formula_64 with a still unknown formula_65 .
because formula_48 is on the tangent and on the ellipse , one gets formula_67 .
in case of formula_68 line formula_47 has a second point with the ellipse in common .
with help of ( *num* ) one finds that formula_70 is a tangent vector at point formula_48 , which proves the vector equation .
if formula_48 and formula_73 are two points of the ellipse , such that formula_74 holds , then the points lie on two " conjugate diameters " of the ellipse ( see below ) .
in case of formula_75 the ellipse is a circle and " conjugate " means " orthogonal " .
if the ellipse is shifted such that its center is formula_76 the equation is the axes are still parallel to the x- and y-axes .
using the sine and cosine functions formula_78 , a parametric representation of the ellipse formula_79 can be obtained , : parameter " t " can be taken as shown in the diagram and is due to de la hire .
the parameter " t " ( called the " eccentric anomaly " in astronomy ) is not the angle of formula_81 with the " x"-axis ( see diagram at right ) .
for other interpretations of parameter " t " see section " drawing ellipses " .
with the substitution formula_82 and trigonometric formulae one gets and the " rational " parametric equation of an ellipse for formula_86 this formula represents the right upper quarter of the ellipse moving counter-clockwise with increasing formula_87 the left vertex is the limit formula_88 rational representations of conic sections are popular with computer aided design ( see bezier curve ) .
a parametric representation , which uses the slope formula_89 of the tangent at a point of the ellipse can be obtained from the derivative of the standard representation formula_90 : with help of trigonometric formulae one gets : replacing formula_93 und formula_94 of the standard representation one yields where formula_89 is the slope of the tangent at the corresponding ellipse point , formula_97 is the upper and formula_98 the lower half of the ellipse .
the points with vertical tangents ( verticesformula_99 ) are not covered by the representation .
the equation of the tangent at point formula_100 has the form formula_101 .
the still unknown formula_102 can be determined by inserting the coordinates of the corresponding ellipse point formula_100 : this description of the tangents of an ellipse is an essential tool for the determination of the orthoptic of an ellipse .
the orthoptic article contains another proof , which omits differential calculus and trigonometric formulae .
a " shifted ellipse " with center formula_76 can be described by a parametric representation of an arbitrary ellipse is contained in the section " ellipse as an affine image of the unit circle x²+y²=1 " below .
the parameters formula_11 and formula_108 represent the lengths of line segments and are therefore non-negative real numbers .
throughout " this article " formula_11 is the semi-major axis , i .
e .
, formula_110 in general the canonical ellipse equation formula_111 may have formula_112 ( and hence the ellipse would be taller than it is wide ) ; in this form the semi-major axis would be formula_108 .
this form can be converted to the form assumed in the remainder of this article simply by transposing the variable names formula_114 and formula_115 and the parameter names formula_11 and formula_117 the two lines at distance formula_118 and parallel to the minor axis are called " directrices " of the ellipse ( see diagram ) .
the proof for the pair formula_121 follows from the fact that formula_122 and formula_123 satisfy the equation the second case is proven analogously .
the " inverse statement " is also true and can be used to define an ellipse ( in a manner similar to the definition of a parabola ) : the choice formula_132 , which is the eccentricity of a circle , is in this context not allowed .
one may consider the directrix of a circle to be the line at infinity .
let formula_135 , and assume formula_136 is a point on the curve .
the directrix formula_126 has equation formula_138 .
with formula_139 , the relation formula_140 produces the equations the substitution formula_143 yields this is the equation of an " ellipse " ( formula_145 ) , or a " parabola " ( formula_146 ) , or a " hyperbola " ( formula_147 ) .
all of these non-degenerate conics have , in common , the origin as a vertex ( see diagram ) .
if formula_145 , introduce new parameters formula_149 so that formula_150 , and then the equation above becomes which is the equation of an ellipse with center formula_152 , the " x"-axis as major axis , and the major / minor semi axis formula_149 .
if the focus is formula_154 and the directrix formula_155 , one obtains the equation for an ellipse the following statement is true : because the tangent is perpendicular to the normal , the statement is true for the tangent and the supplementary angle of the angle between the lines to the foci ( see diagram ) , too .
let formula_160 be the point on the line formula_161 with the distance formula_3 to the focus formula_2 , formula_11 is the semi-major axis of the ellipse .
let line formula_165 be the bisector of the supplementary angle to the angle between the lines formula_159 .
in order to prove that formula_165 is the tangent line at point formula_7 , one checks that any point formula_169 on line formula_165 which is different from formula_7 cannot be on the ellipse .
hence formula_165 has only point formula_7 in common with the ellipse and is , therefore , the tangent at point formula_7 .
from the diagram and the triangle inequality one recognizes that formula_175 holds , which means : formula_176 .
but if formula_169 is a point of the ellipse , the sum should be formula_3 .
the rays from one focus are reflected by the ellipse to the second focus .
this property has optical and acoustic applications similar to the reflective property of a parabola ( see whispering gallery ) .
another definition of an ellipse uses affine transformations : an affine transformation of the euclidean plane has the form formula_180 , where formula_181 is a regular matrix ( its determinant is not *num* ) and formula_182 is an arbitrary vector .
if formula_183 are the column vectors of the matrix formula_181 , the unit circle formula_185 is mapped onto the ellipse formula_182 is the center , formula_188 are the directions of two conjugate diameters of the ellipse .
in general the vectors formula_183 are not perpendicular .
that means , in general formula_190 and formula_191 are " not " the vertices of the ellipse .
the tangent vector at point formula_192 is because at a vertex the tangent is perpendicular to the major / minor axis ( diameters ) of the ellipse one gets the parameter formula_194 of a vertex from the equation and hence ( the formulae formula_197 were used .
) if formula_198 , then formula_199 .
the four " vertices " of the ellipse are formula_200 the advantage of this definition is that one gets a simple parametric representation of an arbitrary ellipse , even in the space , if the vectors formula_201 are vectors of the euclidean space .
for a circle , the property ( m ) holds : the diameter and the parallel chords are orthogonal .
an affine transformation in general does not preserve orthogonality but does preserve parallelism and midpoints of line segments .
hence : property ( m ) ( which omits the term " orthogonal " ) is true for any ellipse .
two diameters formula_202 of an ellipse are conjugate if the midpoints of chords parallel to formula_203 lie on formula_204 from the diagram one finds : the term " conjugate diameters " is a kind of generalization of " orthogonal " .
considering the parametric equation of an ellipse , any pair formula_210 of points belong to a diameter and the pair formula_211 belongs to its conjugate diameter .
for the ellipse formula_212 the intersection points of " orthogonal " tangents lie on the circle formula_213 .
this circle is called " orthoptic " of the given ellipse .
for an ellipse with semi-axes formula_214 the following is true : let the ellipse be in the canonical form with parametric equation the two points formula_222 are on conjugate diameters ( see previous section ) .
from trigonometric formulae one gets formula_223 and the area of the triangle generated by formula_225 is and from the diagram it can be seen that the area of the parallelogram is *num* times that of formula_227 .
hence ellipses appear in descriptive geometry as images ( parallel or central projection ) of circles .
there exist various tools to draw an ellipse .
computers provide the fastest and most accurate method for drawing an ellipse .
however , technical tools ( " ellipsographs " ) to draw an ellipse without a computer exist .
the principle of ellipsographs were known to greek mathematicians ( archimedes , proklos ) .
if there is no ellipsograph available , the best and quickest way to draw an ellipse is to draw an approximation by the four osculating circles at the vertices .
for any method described below if this presumption is not fulfilled one has to know at least two conjugate diameters .
with help of rytz's construction the axes and semi-axes can be retrieved .
the characterization of an ellipse as the locus of points so that sum of the distances to the foci is constant leads to a method of drawing one using two drawing pins , a length of string , and a pencil .
in this method , pins are pushed into the paper at two points , which become the ellipse's foci .
a string tied at each end to the two pins and the tip of a pencil pulls the loop taut to form a triangle .
the tip of the pencil then traces an ellipse if it is moved while keeping the string taut .
using two pegs and a rope , gardeners use this procedure to outline an elliptical flower bed—thus it is called the " gardener's ellipse " .
a similar method for drawing with a " closed " string is due to the irish bishop charles graves .
the two following methods rely on the parametric representation ( see section " parametric representation " , above ) : this representation can be modeled technically by two simple methods .
in both cases center , the axes and semi axes formula_230 have to be known .
the first method starts with the point , where the semi axes meet is marked by formula_7 .
if the strip slides with both ends on the axes of the desired ellipse , then point p traces the ellipse .
for the proof one shows that point formula_7 has the parametric representation formula_229 , where parameter formula_235 is the angle of the slope of the paper strip .
a " technical realization " of the motion of the paper strip can be achieved by a tusi couple ( s .
animation ) .
the device is able to draw any ellipse with a " fixed " sum formula_231 , which is the radius of the large circle .
this restriction may be a disadvantage in real life .
more flexible is the second paper strip method .
a nice application : if one stands somewhere in the middle of a ladder , which stands on a slippery ground and leans on a slippery wall , the ladder slides down and the persons feet trace an ellipse .
a " variation of the paper strip method *num* " uses the observation that the midpoint formula_237 of the paper strip is moving on the circle with center formula_238 ( of the ellipse ) and radius formula_239 .
hence the paperstrip can be cut at point formula_237 into halves , connected again by a joint at formula_237 and the sliding end formula_242 fixed at the center formula_238 ( see diagram ) .
after this operation the movement of the unchanged half of the paperstrip is unchanged .
the advantage of this variation is : only one expensive sliding shoe is necessary .
one should be aware that the end , which is sliding on the minor axis , has to be changed .
the second method starts with one marks the point , which divides the strip into two substrips of length formula_108 and formula_246 .
the strip is positioned onto the axes as described in the diagram .
then the free end of the strip traces an ellipse , while the strip is moved .
for the proof , one recognizes that the tracing point can be described parametrically by formula_229 , where parameter formula_248 is the angle of slope of the paper strip .
this method is the base for several " ellipsographs " ( see section below ) .
similar to the variation of the paper strip method *num* a " variation of the paper strip method *num* " can be established ( see diagram ) by cutting the part between the axes into halves .
from section " metric properties " one gets : the diagram shows an easy way to find the centers formula_253 of curvature at vertex formula_254 and co-vertex formula_255 , respectively : the centers for the remaining vertices are found by symmetry .
with help of a french curve one draws a curve , which has smooth contact to the osculating circles .
the following method to construct single points of an ellipse relies on the steiner generation of a non degenerate conic section : for the generation of points of the ellipse formula_212 one uses the pencils at the vertices formula_14 .
let formula_269 be an upper co-vertex of the ellipse and formula_270 .
formula_7 is the center of the rectangle formula_272 .
the side formula_273 of the rectangle is divided into n equal spaced line segments and this division is projected parallel with the diagonal formula_274 as direction onto the line segment formula_275 and assign the division as shown in the diagram .
the parallel projection together with the reverse of the orientation is part of the projective mapping between the pencils at formula_254 and formula_277 needed .
the intersection points of any two related lines formula_278 and formula_279 are points of the uniquely defined ellipse .
with help of the points formula_280 the points of the second quarter of the ellipse can be determined .
analogously one gets the points of the lower half of the ellipse .
the steiner generation also exists for hyperbolas and parabolas .
it is sometimes called a " parallelogram method " because one can use other points rather than the vertices , which starts with a parallelogram instead of a rectangle .
most technical instruments for drawing ellipses are based on the second paperstrip method .
a circle with equation formula_281 is uniquely determined by three points formula_282 not on a line .
a simple way to determine the parameters formula_283 uses the " inscribed angle theorem " for circles : usually one measures inscribed angles by " degree " or " radian " .
in order to get an equation of a circle determined by three points , the following measurement is more convenient : at first the measure is available for chords , which are not parallel to the y-axis , only .
but the final formula works for any chord .
a consequence of the inscribed angle theorem for circles is the using vectors , dot products and determinants this formula can be arranged more clearly : for example , for formula_296 the 3-pointform is this section considers ellipses with an equation where the ratio formula_300 is " fixed " .
with the abbreviation formula_301 one gets the more convenient form such ellipses have their axes parallel to the coordinate axes and their eccentricity fixed .
their major axes are parallel to the " x"-axis if formula_304 and parallel to the " y"-axis if formula_305 .
like a circle , such an ellipse is determined by three points not on a line .
in this more general case one introduces the following measurement of an angle , : at first the measure is available only for chords which are not parallel to the y-axis .
but the final formula works for any chord .
the proof follows from a straightforward calculation .
for the direction of proof given that the points are on an ellipse , one can assume that the center of the ellipse is the origin .
a consequence of the inscribed angle theorem for ellipses is the analogously to the circle case this formula can be written more clearly using vectors : where formula_316 is the modified dot product formula_317 for example , for formula_296 and formula_319 one gets the 3-point-form any ellipse can be described in a suitable coordinate system by an equation formula_79 .
the equation of the tangent at a point formula_323 of the ellipse is formula_324 if one allows point formula_323 to be an arbitrary point different from the origin , then this relation between points and lines is a bijection .
the inverse function maps such a relation between points and lines generated by a conic is called " pole-polar relation " or just " polarity " .
the pole is the point , the polar the line .
see pole and polar .
by calculation one can confirm the following properties of the pole-polar relation of the ellipse : pole-polar relations exist for hyperbolas and parabolas , too .
all metric properties given below refer to an ellipse with equation formula_341 .
the area formula_342 enclosed by an ellipse is : where formula_11 and formula_108 are the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes , respectively .
the area formula formula_346 is intuitive : start with a circle of radius formula_108 ( so its area is formula_348 ) and stretch it by a factor formula_349 to make an ellipse .
this scales the area by the same factor : formula_350 it is also easy to rigorously prove the area formula using integration as follows .
equation ( ) can be rewritten as formula_351 for formula_352 this curve is the top half of the ellipse .
so twice the integral of formula_353 over the interval formula_354 will be the area of the ellipse : the second integral is the area of a circle of radius formula_356 that is , formula_357 so an ellipse defined implicitly by formula_359 has area formula_360 the area can also be expressed in terms of eccentricity and the length of the semi-major axis as formula_361 ( obtained by solving for flattening , then computing the semi-minor axis ) .
the circumference formula_13 of an ellipse is : where again formula_11 is the length of the semi-major axis , formula_18 is the eccentricity formula_366 and the function formula_367 is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind , the circumference of the ellipse may be evaluated in terms of formula_369 using gauss's arithmetic-geometric mean ; this is a quadratically converging iterative method .
the exact infinite series is : where formula_372 is the double factorial .
unfortunately , this series converges rather slowly ; however , by expanding in terms of formula_373 ivory and bessel derived an expression that converges much more rapidly , ramanujan gives two good approximations for the circumference in §16 of " modular equations and approximations to formula_264 " ; they are and the errors in these approximations , which were obtained empirically , are of order formula_378 and formula_379 respectively .
more generally , the arc length of a portion of the circumference , as a function of the angle subtended , is given by an incomplete elliptic integral .
the inverse function , the angle subtended as a function of the arc length , is given by the elliptic functions .
some lower and upper bounds on the circumference of the canonical ellipse formula_380 with formula_381 are here the upper bound formula_385 is the circumference of a circumscribed concentric circle passing through the endpoints of the ellipse's major axis , and the lower bound formula_386 is the perimeter of an inscribed rhombus with vertices at the endpoints of the major and the minor axes .
the curvature is given by formula_387 radius of curvature at point formula_32 : radius of curvature at the two " vertices " formula_390 and the centers of curvature : radius of curvature at the two " co-vertices " formula_392 and the centers of curvature : in analytic geometry , the ellipse is defined as a quadric : the set of points formula_394 of the cartesian plane that , in non-degenerate cases , satisfy the implicit equation provided formula_396 to distinguish the degenerate cases from the non-degenerate case , let " ∆ " be the determinant that is , then the ellipse is a non-degenerate real ellipse if and only if " c∆ " *num* .
if " c∆ " *num* , we have an imaginary ellipse , and if " ∆ " = *num* , we have a point ellipse .
the general equation's coefficients can be obtained from known semi-major axis formula_11 , semi-minor axis formula_108 , center coordinates formula_401 and rotation angle formula_402 using the following formulae : these expressions can be derived from the canonical equation ( see next section ) by substituting the coordinates with expressions for rotation and translation of the coordinate system : let formula_407 .
through change of coordinates ( a rotation of axes and a translation of axes ) the general ellipse can be described by the canonical implicit equation here formula_32 are the point coordinates in the canonical system , whose origin is the center formula_410 of the ellipse , whose formula_114-axis is the unit vector formula_412 coinciding with the major axis , and whose formula_413-axis is the perpendicular vector formula_414 coinciding with the minor axis .
that is , formula_415 and formula_416 .
in this system , the center is the origin formula_136 and the foci are formula_418 and formula_419 for eccentricity " e " .
any ellipse can be obtained by rotation and translation of a canonical ellipse with the proper semi-diameters .
the expression of an ellipse centered at formula_410 is moreover , any canonical ellipse can be obtained by scaling the unit circle of formula_422 , defined by the equation by factors " a " and " b " along the two axes .
for an ellipse in canonical form , we have the distances from a point formula_394 on the ellipse to the left and right foci are formula_426 and formula_427 , respectively .
the canonical form coefficients can be obtained from the general form coefficients using the following equations : where formula_402 is the angle from the positive horizontal axis to the ellipse's major axis .
in polar coordinates , with the origin at the center of the ellipse and with the angular coordinate formula_430 measured from the major axis , the ellipse's equation is if instead we use polar coordinates with the origin at one focus , with the angular coordinate formula_432 still measured from the major axis , the ellipse's equation is where the sign in the denominator is negative if the reference direction formula_432 points towards the center ( as illustrated on the right ) , and positive if that direction points away from the center .
in the slightly more general case of an ellipse with one focus at the origin and the other focus at angular coordinate formula_435 , the polar form is the angle formula_430 in these formulas is called the true anomaly of the point .
the numerator formula_438 of these formulas is the semi-latus rectum of the ellipse , usually denoted formula_126 .
it is the distance from a focus of the ellipse to the ellipse itself , measured along a line perpendicular to the major axis .
the ellipse is a special case of the hypotrochoid when "r" = 2"r " , as shown in the adjacent image .
the special case of a moving circle with radius formula_440 inside a circle with radius formula_441 is called a tusi couple .
ellipses appear in triangle geometry as ellipses appear as plane sections of the following quadrics : if the water's surface is disturbed at one focus of an elliptical water tank , the circular waves of that disturbance , after reflecting off the walls , converge simultaneously to a single point : the " second focus " .
this is a consequence of the total travel length being the same along any wall-bouncing path between the two foci .
similarly , if a light source is placed at one focus of an elliptic mirror , all light rays on the plane of the ellipse are reflected to the second focus .
since no other smooth curve has such a property , it can be used as an alternative definition of an ellipse .
( in the special case of a circle with a source at its center all light would be reflected back to the center .
) if the ellipse is rotated along its major axis to produce an ellipsoidal mirror ( specifically , a prolate spheroid ) , this property holds for all rays out of the source .
alternatively , a cylindrical mirror with elliptical cross-section can be used to focus light from a linear fluorescent lamp along a line of the paper ; such mirrors are used in some document scanners .
sound waves are reflected in a similar way , so in a large elliptical room a person standing at one focus can hear a person standing at the other focus remarkably well .
the effect is even more evident under a vaulted roof shaped as a section of a prolate spheroid .
such a room is called a " whisper chamber " .
the same effect can be demonstrated with two reflectors shaped like the end caps of such a spheroid , placed facing each other at the proper distance .
examples are the national statuary hall at the united states capitol ( where john quincy adams is said to have used this property for eavesdropping on political matters ) ; the mormon tabernacle at temple square in salt lake city , utah ; at an exhibit on sound at the museum of science and industry in chicago ; in front of the university of illinois at urbana–champaign foellinger auditorium ; and also at a side chamber of the palace of charles v , in the alhambra .
in the *ord* century , johannes kepler discovered that the orbits along which the planets travel around the sun are ellipses with the sun [ approximately ] at one focus , in his first law of planetary motion .
later , isaac newton explained this as a corollary of his law of universal gravitation .
more generally , in the gravitational two-body problem , if the two bodies are bound to each other ( that is , the total energy is negative ) , their orbits are similar ellipses with the common barycenter being one of the foci of each ellipse .
the other focus of either ellipse has no known physical significance .
the orbit of either body in the reference frame of the other is also an ellipse , with the other body at the same focus .
keplerian elliptical orbits are the result of any radially directed attraction force whose strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance .
thus , in principle , the motion of two oppositely charged particles in empty space would also be an ellipse .
( however , this conclusion ignores losses due to electromagnetic radiation and quantum effects , which become significant when the particles are moving at high speed .
) for elliptical orbits , useful relations involving the eccentricity formula_18 are : where also , in terms of formula_444 and formula_445 , the semi-major axis formula_11 is their arithmetic mean , the semi-minor axis formula_108 is their geometric mean , and the semi-latus rectum formula_126 is their harmonic mean .
in other words , the general solution for a harmonic oscillator in two or more dimensions is also an ellipse .
such is the case , for instance , of a long pendulum that is free to move in two dimensions ; of a mass attached to a fixed point by a perfectly elastic spring ; or of any object that moves under influence of an attractive force that is directly proportional to its distance from a fixed attractor .
unlike keplerian orbits , however , these " harmonic orbits " have the center of attraction at the geometric center of the ellipse , and have fairly simple equations of motion .
in electronics , the relative phase of two sinusoidal signals can be compared by feeding them to the vertical and horizontal inputs of an oscilloscope .
if the display is an ellipse , rather than a straight line , the two signals are out of phase .
two non-circular gears with the same elliptical outline , each pivoting around one focus and positioned at the proper angle , turn smoothly while maintaining contact at all times .
alternatively , they can be connected by a link chain or timing belt , or in the case of a bicycle the main chainring may be elliptical , or an ovoid similar to an ellipse in form .
such elliptical gears may be used in mechanical equipment to produce variable angular speed or torque from a constant rotation of the driving axle , or in the case of a bicycle to allow a varying crank rotation speed with inversely varying mechanical advantage .
elliptical bicycle gears make it easier for the chain to slide off the cog when changing gears .
an example gear application would be a device that winds thread onto a conical bobbin on a spinning machine .
the bobbin would need to wind faster when the thread is near the apex than when it is near the base .
in statistics , a bivariate random vector ( " x " , " y " ) is jointly elliptically distributed if its iso-density contours—loci of equal values of the density function—are ellipses .
the concept extends to an arbitrary number of elements of the random vector , in which case in general the iso-density contours are ellipsoids .
a special case is the multivariate normal distribution .
the elliptical distributions are important in finance because if rates of return on assets are jointly elliptically distributed then all portfolios can be characterized completely by their mean and variance—that is , any two portfolios with identical mean and variance of portfolio return have identical distributions of portfolio return .
drawing an ellipse as a graphics primitive is common in standard display libraries , such as the macintosh quickdraw api , and direct2d on windows .
jack bresenham at ibm is most famous for the invention of 2d drawing primitives , including line and circle drawing , using only fast integer operations such as addition and branch on carry bit .

pitteway extended bresenham's algorithm for lines to conics in *num* .
another efficient generalization to draw ellipses was invented in *num* by jerry van aken .
in *num* danny cohen presented at the " computer graphics *num* " conference in england a linear algorithm for drawing ellipses and circles .
in *num* , l .

smith published similar algorithms for all conic sections and proved them to have good properties .
these algorithms need only a few multiplications and additions to calculate each vector .
it is beneficial to use a parametric formulation in computer graphics because the density of points is greatest where there is the most curvature .
thus , the change in slope between each successive point is small , reducing the apparent " jaggedness " of the approximation .
composite bézier curves may also be used to draw an ellipse to sufficient accuracy , since any ellipse may be construed as an affine transformation of a circle .
the spline methods used to draw a circle may be used to draw an ellipse , since the constituent bézier curves behave appropriately under such transformations .
it is sometimes useful to find the minimum bounding ellipse on a set of points .
the ellipsoid method is quite useful for attacking this problem .
epilepsy epilepsy is a group of neurological disorders characterized by epileptic seizures .
epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable periods to long periods of vigorous shaking .
these episodes can result in physical injuries , including occasionally broken bones .
in epilepsy , seizures tend to recur and , as a rule , have no immediate underlying cause .
isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy .
people with epilepsy may be treated differently in various areas of the world and experience varying degrees of social stigma due to their condition .
the cause of most cases of epilepsy is unknown .
some cases occur as the result of brain injury , stroke , brain tumors , infections of the brain , and birth defects through a process known as epileptogenesis .
known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases .
epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal neuronal activity in the cortex of the brain .
the diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms , such as fainting , and determining if another cause of seizures is present , such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems .
this may be partly done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests .
epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram ( eeg ) , but a normal test does not rule out the condition .
epilepsy that occurs as a result of other issues may be preventable .
seizures are controllable with medication in about *num* % of cases .
inexpensive options are often available .
in those whose seizures do not respond to medication , surgery , neurostimulation or dietary changes may then be considered .
not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong , and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed .
, about *num* million people have epilepsy .
nearly *num* % of cases occur in the developing world .
in *num* , it resulted in *num* , *num* deaths up from *num* , *num* deaths in *num* .
epilepsy is more common in older people .
in the developed world , onset of new cases occurs most frequently in babies and the elderly .
in the developing world , onset is more common in older children and young adults , due to differences in the frequency of the underlying causes .
about 5–10 % of people will have an unprovoked seizure by the age of *num* , and the chance of experiencing a second seizure is between *num* and *num* % .
in many areas of the world , those with epilepsy either have restrictions placed on their ability to drive or are not permitted to drive until they are free of seizures for a specific length of time .
the word epilepsy is from ancient greek ἐπιλαμβάνειν , " to seize , possess , or afflict " .
epilepsy is characterized by a long-term risk of recurrent seizures .
these seizures may present in several ways depending on the part of the brain involved and the person's age .
the most common type ( *num* % ) of seizures are convulsive .
of these , one-third begin as generalized seizures from the start , affecting both hemispheres of the brain .
two-thirds begin as focal seizures ( which affect one hemisphere of the brain ) which may then progress to generalized seizures .
the remaining *num* % of seizures are non-convulsive .
an example of this type is the absence seizure , which presents as a decreased level of consciousness and usually lasts about *num* seconds .
focal seizures are often preceded by certain experiences , known as auras .
they include sensory ( visual , hearing , or smell ) , psychic , autonomic , and motor phenomena .
jerking activity may start in a specific muscle group and spread to surrounding muscle groups in which case it is known as a jacksonian march .
automatisms may occur , which are non-consciously-generated activities and mostly simple repetitive movements like smacking of the lips or more complex activities such as attempts to pick up something .
there are six main types of generalized seizures : tonic-clonic , tonic , clonic , myoclonic , absence and atonic seizures .
they all involve loss of consciousness and typically happen without warning .
tonic-clonic seizures occur with a contraction of the limbs followed by their extension along with arching of the back which lasts 10–30 seconds ( the tonic phase ) .
a cry may be heard due to contraction of the chest muscles , followed by a shaking of the limbs in unison ( clonic phase ) .
tonic seizures produce constant contractions of the muscles .
a person often turns blue as breathing is stopped .
in clonic seizures there is shaking of the limbs in unison .
after the shaking has stopped it may take 10–30 minutes for the person to return to normal ; this period is called the " postictal state " or " postictal phase .
" loss of bowel or bladder control may occur during a seizure .
the tongue may be bitten at either the tip or on the sides during a seizure .
in tonic-clonic seizure , bites to the sides are more common .
tongue bites are also relatively common in psychogenic non-epileptic seizures .
myoclonic seizures involve spasms of muscles in either a few areas or all over .
absence seizures can be subtle with only a slight turn of the head or eye blinking .
the person does not fall over and returns to normal right after it ends .
atonic seizures involve the loss of muscle activity for greater than one second .
this typically occurs on both sides of the body .
about *num* % of those with epilepsy have seizures that are often triggered by specific events and are known as reflex seizures .
those with reflex epilepsy have seizures that are only triggered by specific stimuli .
common triggers include flashing lights and sudden noises .
in certain types of epilepsy , seizures happen more often during sleep , and in other types they occur almost only when sleeping .
after the active portion of a seizure ( the ictal state ) there is typically a period of recovery during which there is confusion , referred to as the postictal period before a normal level of consciousness returns .
it usually lasts *num* to *num* minutes but may last for hours .
other common symptoms include feeling tired , headache , difficulty speaking , and abnormal behavior .
psychosis after a seizure is relatively common , occurring in 6–10 % of people .
often people do not remember what happened during this time .
localized weakness , known as todd's paralysis , may also occur after a focal seizure .
when it occurs it typically lasts for seconds to minutes but may rarely last for a day or two .
epilepsy can have adverse effects on social and psychological well-being .
these effects may include social isolation , stigmatization , or disability .
they may result in lower educational achievement and worse employment outcomes .
learning disabilities are common in those with the condition , and especially among children with epilepsy .
the stigma of epilepsy can also affect the families of those with the disorder .
certain disorders occur more often in people with epilepsy , depending partly on the epilepsy syndrome present .
these include depression , anxiety , obsessive–compulsive disorder ( ocd ) , and migraine .
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder affects three to five times more children with epilepsy than children without the condition .
adhd and epilepsy have significant consequences on a child's behavioral , learning , and social development .
epilepsy is also more common in children with autism .
epilepsy can have both genetic and acquired causes , with interaction of these factors in many cases .
established acquired causes include serious brain trauma , stroke , tumours and problems in the brain as a result of a previous infection .
in about *num* % of cases the cause is unknown .
epilepsies caused by genetic , congenital , or developmental conditions are more common among younger people , while brain tumors and strokes are more likely in older people .
seizures may also occur as a consequence of other health problems ; if they occur right around a specific cause , such as a stroke , head injury , toxic ingestion or metabolic problem , they are known as acute symptomatic seizures and are in the broader classification of seizure-related disorders rather than epilepsy itself .
genetics is believed to be involved in the majority of cases , either directly or indirectly .
some epilepsies are due to a single gene defect ( 1–2 % ) ; most are due to the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors .
each of the single gene defects is rare , with more than *num* in all described .
most genes involved affect ion channels , either directly or indirectly .
these include genes for ion channels themselves , enzymes , gaba , and g protein-coupled receptors .
in identical twins , if one is affected there is a 50–60 % chance that the other will also be affected .
in non-identical twins the risk is *num* % .
these risks are greater in those with generalized rather than focal seizures .
if both twins are affected , most of the time they have the same epileptic syndrome ( 70–90 % ) .
other close relatives of a person with epilepsy have a risk five times that of the general population .
between *num* and *num* % of those with down syndrome and *num* % of those with angelman syndrome have epilepsy .
epilepsy may occur as a result of a number of other conditions including tumors , strokes , head trauma , previous infections of the central nervous system , genetic abnormalities , and as a result of brain damage around the time of birth .
of those with brain tumors , almost *num* % have epilepsy , making them the cause of about *num* % of cases .
the risk is greatest for tumors in the temporal lobe and those that grow slowly .
other mass lesions such as cerebral cavernous malformations and arteriovenous malformations have risks as high as *num* % .
of those who have had a stroke , 2–4 % develop epilepsy .
in the united kingdom strokes account for *num* % of cases and it is believed to be the cause in *num* % of the elderly .
between *num* and *num* % of epilepsy is believed to be due to head trauma .
mild brain injury increases the risk about two-fold while severe brain injury increases the risk seven-fold .
in those who have experienced a high-powered gunshot wound to the head , the risk is about *num* % .
some evidence links epilepsy and celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity , while other evidence does not .
there appears to be a specific syndrome which includes coeliac disease , epilepsy and calcifications in the brain .
a *num* review estimates that between *num* % and *num* % of people with epilepsy have coeliac disease while *num* % of the general population has the condition .
the risk of epilepsy following meningitis is less than *num* % ; that disease more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself .
in herpes simplex encephalitis the risk of a seizure is around *num* % with a high risk of epilepsy following ( up to *num* % ) .
a form of an infection with the pork tapeworm ( cysticercosis ) , in the brain , is known as neurocysticercosis , and is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common .
epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria , toxoplasmosis , and toxocariasis .
chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy : those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a two and a half fold increase in risk .
other risks include alzheimer's disease , multiple sclerosis , tuberous sclerosis , and autoimmune encephalitis .
getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy .
malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in the developing world , although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association .
people with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of epilepsy , with half of people with spastic quadriplegia and spastic hemiplegia having the disease .
normally brain electrical activity is non-synchronous .
its activity is regulated by various factors both within the neuron and the cellular environment .
factors within the neuron include the type , number and distribution of ion channels , changes to receptors and changes of gene expression .
factors around the neuron include ion concentrations , synaptic plasticity and regulation of transmitter breakdown by glial cells .
chronic inflammation also appears to play a role .
the exact mechanism of epilepsy is unknown , but a little is known about its cellular and network mechanisms .
however , it is unknown under which circumstances the brain shifts into the activity of a seizure with its excessive synchronization .
in epilepsy , the resistance of excitatory neurons to fire during this period is decreased .
this may occur due to changes in ion channels or inhibitory neurons not functioning properly .
this then results in a specific area from which seizures may develop , known as a " seizure focus " .
another mechanism of epilepsy may be the up-regulation of excitatory circuits or down-regulation of inhibitory circuits following an injury to the brain .
these secondary epilepsies occur through processes known as epileptogenesis .
failure of the blood–brain barrier may also be a causal mechanism as it would allow substances in the blood to enter the brain .
there is evidence that epileptic seizures are usually not a random event .
seizures are often brought on by factors such as stress , alcohol abuse , flickering light , or a lack of sleep , among others .
the term seizure threshold is used to indicate the amount of stimulus necessary to bring about a seizure .
seizure threshold is lowered in epilepsy .
in epileptic seizures a group of neurons begin firing in an abnormal , excessive , and synchronized manner .
this results in a wave of depolarization known as a paroxysmal depolarizing shift .
normally , after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes more resistant to firing for a period of time .
this is due in part to the effect of inhibitory neurons , electrical changes within the excitatory neuron , and the negative effects of adenosine .
focal seizures begin in one hemisphere of the brain while generalized seizures begin in both hemispheres .
some types of seizures may change brain structure , while others appear to have little effect .
gliosis , neuronal loss , and atrophy of specific areas of the brain are linked to epilepsy but it is unclear if epilepsy causes these changes or if these changes result in epilepsy .
the diagnosis of epilepsy is typically made based on observation of the seizure onset and the underlying cause .
an electroencephalogram ( eeg ) to look for abnormal patterns of brain waves and neuroimaging ( ct scan or mri ) to look at the structure of the brain are also usually part of the workup .
while figuring out a specific epileptic syndrome is often attempted , it is not always possible .
video and eeg monitoring may be useful in difficult cases .
epilepsy is a disorder of the brain defined by any of the following conditions : furthermore , epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who had an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome but are now past that age or those who have remained seizure-free for the last *num* years , with no seizure medicines for the last *num* years .
this *num* definition of the international league against epilepsy is a clarification of the ilae *num* conceptual definition , according to which epilepsy is " a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiologic , cognitive , psychological , and social consequences of this condition .
the definition of epilepsy requires the occurrence of at least one epileptic seizure .
" it is , therefore , possible to outgrow epilepsy or to undergo treatment that causes epilepsy to be resolved , but with no guarantee that it will not return .
in the definition , epilepsy is now called a disease , rather than a disorder .
this was a decision of the executive committee of the ilae , taken because the word " disorder , " while perhaps having less stigma than does " disease , " also does not express the degree of seriousness that epilepsy deserves .
the definition is practical in nature and is designed for clinical use .
in particular , it aims to clarify when an " enduring predisposition " according to the *num* conceptual definition is present .
researchers , statistically-minded epidemiologists , and other specialized groups may choose to use the older definition or a definition of their own devising .
the ilae considers doing so is perfectly allowable , so long as it is clear what definition is being used .
in contrast to the classification of seizures which focuses on what happens during a seizure , the classification of epilepsies focuses on the underlying causes .
when a person is admitted to hospital after an epileptic seizure the diagnostic workup results preferably in the seizure itself being classified ( e .
g .
tonic-clonic ) and in the underlying disease being identified ( e .
g .
hippocampal sclerosis ) .
the name of the diagnosis finally made depends on the available diagnostic results and the applied definitions and classifications ( of seizures and epilepsies ) and its respective terminology .
the international league against epilepsy ( ilae ) provided a classification of the epilepsies and epileptic syndromes in *num* as follows : this classification was widely accepted but has also been criticized mainly because the underlying causes of epilepsy ( which are a major determinant of clinical course and prognosis ) were not covered in detail .
in *num* the ilae commission for classification of the epilepsies addressed this issue and divided epilepsies into three categories ( genetic , structural / metabolic , unknown cause ) that were refined in their *num* recommendation into four categories and a number of subcategories reflecting recent technologic and scientific advances .
cases of epilepsy may be organized into epilepsy syndromes by the specific features that are present .
these features include the age that seizure begin , the seizure types , eeg findings , among others .
identifying an epilepsy syndrome is useful as it helps determine the underlying causes as well as what anti-seizure medication should be tried .
the ability to categorize a case of epilepsy into a specific syndrome occurs more often with children since the onset of seizures is commonly early .
less serious examples are benign rolandic epilepsy ( *num* .
*num* per *num* , *num* ) , childhood absence epilepsy ( *num* .
*num* per *num* , *num* ) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy ( *num* .
*num* per *num* , *num* ) .
severe syndromes with diffuse brain dysfunction caused , at least partly , by some aspect of epilepsy , are also referred to as epileptic encephalopathies .
these are associated with frequent seizures that are resistant to treatment and severe cognitive dysfunction , for instance lennox–gastaut syndrome and west syndrome .
genetics is believed to play an important role in epilepsies by a number of mechanisms .
simple and complex modes of inheritance have been identified for some of them .
however , extensive screening have failed to identify many single gene variants of large effect .
more recent exome and genome sequencing studies have begun to reveal a number of de novo gene mutations that are responsible for some epileptic encephalopathies , including chd2 and syngap1 and dnm1 , gabbr2 , fasn and ryr3 .
syndromes in which causes are not clearly identified are difficult to match with categories of the current classification of epilepsy .
categorization for these cases was made somewhat arbitrarily .
the " idiopathic " ( unknown cause ) category of the *num* classification includes syndromes in which the general clinical features and / or age specificity strongly point to a presumed genetic cause .
some childhood epilepsy syndromes are included in the unknown cause category in which the cause is presumed genetic , for instance benign rolandic epilepsy .
others are included in " symptomatic " despite a presumed genetic cause ( in at least in some cases ) , for instance lennox-gastaut syndrome .
clinical syndromes in which epilepsy is not the main feature ( e .
g .
angelman syndrome ) were categorized " symptomatic " but it was argued to include these within the category " idiopathic " .
classification of epilepsies and particularly of epilepsy syndromes will change with advances in research .
an electroencephalogram ( eeg ) can assist in showing brain activity suggestive of an increased risk of seizures .
it is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms .
in the diagnosis of epilepsy , electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present .
in children it is typically only needed after a second seizure .
it cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the disease .
in certain situations it may be useful to perform the eeg while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived .
diagnostic imaging by ct scan and mri is recommended after a first non-febrile seizure to detect structural problems in and around the brain .
mri is generally a better imaging test except when bleeding is suspected , for which ct is more sensitive and more easily available .
if someone attends the emergency room with a seizure but returns to normal quickly , imaging tests may be done at a later point .
if a person has a previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging , repeating the imaging is usually not needed even if there are subsequent seizures .
for adults , the testing of electrolyte , blood glucose and calcium levels is important to rule out problems with these as causes .
an electrocardiogram can rule out problems with the rhythm of the heart .
a lumbar puncture may be useful to diagnose a central nervous system infection but is not routinely needed .
in children additional tests may be required such as urine biochemistry and blood testing looking for metabolic disorders .
a high blood prolactin level within the first *num* minutes following a seizure may be useful to help confirm an epileptic seizure as opposed to psychogenic non-epileptic seizure .
serum prolactin level is less useful for detecting focal seizures .
if it is normal an epileptic seizure is still possible and a serum prolactin does not separate epileptic seizures from syncope .
it is not recommended as a routine part of the diagnosis of epilepsy .
diagnosis of epilepsy can be difficult .
a number of other conditions may present very similar signs and symptoms to seizures , including syncope , hyperventilation , migraines , narcolepsy , panic attacks and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures ( pnes ) .
in particular a syncope can be accompanied by a short episode of convulsions .
nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy , often misdiagnosed as nightmares , was considered to be a parasomnia but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome .
attacks of the movement disorder paroxysmal dyskinesia may be taken for epileptic seizures .
the cause of a drop attack can be , among many others , an atonic seizure .
children may have behaviors that are easily mistaken for epileptic seizures but are not .
these include breath-holding spells , bed wetting , night terrors , tics and shudder attacks .
gastroesophageal reflux may cause arching of the back and twisting of the head to the side in infants , which may be mistaken for tonic-clonic seizures .
misdiagnosis is frequent ( occurring in about *num* to *num* % of cases ) .
different studies showed that in many cases seizure-like attacks in apparent treatment-resistant epilepsy have a cardiovascular cause .
approximately *num* % of the people seen at epilepsy clinics have pnes and of those who have pnes about *num* % also have epilepsy ; separating the two based on the seizure episode alone without further testing is often difficult .
while many cases are not preventable , efforts to reduce head injuries , provide good care around the time of birth , and reduce environmental parasites such as the pork tapeworm may be effective .
efforts in one part of central america to decrease rates of pork tapeworm resulted in a *num* % decrease in new cases of epilepsy .
epilepsy is usually treated with daily medication once a second seizure has occurred , while medication may be started after the first seizure in those at high risk for subsequent seizures .
supporting people's self management of their condition may be useful .
in drug-resistant cases different management options may be looked at including a special diet , the implantation of a neurostimulator , or neurosurgery .
rolling a person with an active tonic-clonic seizure onto their side and into the recovery position helps prevent fluids from getting into the lungs .
putting fingers , a bite block or tongue depressor in the mouth is not recommended as it might make the person vomit or result in the rescuer being bitten .
efforts should be taken to prevent further self-injury .
spinal precautions are generally not needed .
if a seizure lasts longer than *num* minutes or if there are more than two seizures in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them , it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus .
this may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected ; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this .
at home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth .
diazepam may also be used rectally .
in hospital , intravenous lorazepam is preferred .
if two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective , other medications such as phenytoin are recommended .
convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol .
the mainstay treatment of epilepsy is anticonvulsant medications , possibly for the person's entire life .
the choice of anticonvulsant is based on seizure type , epilepsy syndrome , other medications used , other health problems , and the person's age and lifestyle .
a single medication is recommended initially ; if this is not effective , switching to a single other medication is recommended .
two medications at once is recommended only if a single medication does not work .
in about half , the first agent is effective ; a second single agent helps in about *num* % and a third or two agents at the same time may help an additional *num* % .
about *num* % of people continue to have seizures despite anticonvulsant treatment .
there are a number of medications available including phenytoin , carbamazepine and valproate .
low-quality evidence suggests that phenytoin , carbamazepine , and valproate may be equally effective in both focal and generalized seizures .
controlled release carbamazepine appears to work as well as immediate release carbamazepine , and may have fewer side effects .
in the united kingdom , carbamazepine or lamotrigine are recommended as first-line treatment for focal seizures , with levetiracetam and valproate as second-line due to issues of cost and side effects .
valproate is recommended first-line for generalized seizures with lamotrigine being second-line .
in those with absence seizures , ethosuximide or valproate are recommended ; valproate is particularly effective in myoclonic seizures and tonic or atonic seizures .
if seizures are well-controlled on a particular treatment , it is not usually necessary to routinely check the medication levels in the blood .
the least expensive anticonvulsant is phenobarbital at around us$5 a year .
the world health organization gives it a first-line recommendation in the developing world and it is commonly used there .
access however may be difficult as some countries label it as a controlled drug .
adverse effects from medications are reported in *num* to *num* % of people , depending on how and from whom the data is collected .
most adverse effects are dose-related and mild .
some examples include mood changes , sleepiness , or an unsteadiness in gait .
certain medications have side effects that are not related to dose such as rashes , liver toxicity , or suppression of the bone marrow .
up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects .
some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy .
many of the common used medications , such as valproate , phenytoin , carbamazepine , phenobarbitol , and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects , especially when used during the first trimester .
despite this , treatment is often continued once effective , because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications .
among the antiepileptic medications , levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects .
slowly stopping medications may be reasonable in some people who do not have a seizure for two to four years ; however , around a third of people have a recurrence , most often during the first six months .
stopping is possible in about *num* % of children and *num* % of adults .
measuring medication levels is not generally needed in those whose seizures are well controlled .
epilepsy surgery may be an option for people with focal seizures that remain a problem despite other treatments .
these other treatments include at least a trial of two or three medications .
the goal of surgery is total control of seizures and this may be achieved in 60–70 % of cases .
common procedures include cutting out the hippocampus via an anterior temporal lobe resection , removal of tumors , and removing parts of the neocortex .
some procedures such as a corpus callosotomy are attempted in an effort to decrease the number of seizures rather than cure the condition .
following surgery , medications may be slowly withdrawn in many cases .
neurostimulation may be another option in those who are not candidates for surgery .
three types have been used in those who do not respond to medications : vagus nerve stimulation , anterior thalamic stimulation , and closed-loop responsive stimulation .
there is tentative evidence that a ketogenic diet ( high-fat , low-carbohydrate , adequate-protein ) decreases the number of seizures and eliminate seizures in some ; however , further research is necessary .
it is a reasonable option in those who have epilepsy that is not improved with medications and for whom surgery is not an option .
about *num* % stay on the diet for a few years due to issues of effectiveness and tolerability .
side effects include stomach and intestinal problems in *num* % , and there are long-term concerns about heart disease .
less radical diets are easier to tolerate and may be effective .
it is unclear why this diet works .
in people with coeliac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity and occipital calcifications , a gluten-free diet may decrease the frequency of seizures .
avoidance therapy consists of minimizing or eliminating triggers .
for example , those who are sensitive to light may have success with using a small television , avoiding video games , or wearing dark glasses .
operant-based biofeedback based on the eeg waves has some support in those who do not respond to medications .
psychological methods should not , however , be used to replace medications .
exercise has been proposed as possibly useful for preventing seizures , with some data to support this claim .
some dogs , commonly referred to as seizure dogs , may help during or after a seizure .
it is not clear if dogs have the ability to predict seizures before they occur .
as an add-on therapy in those who are not well controlled with other medications , cannabidiol appears to be useful in some children .
in *num* the fda approved this product for lennox–gastaut syndrome and dravet syndrome .
alternative medicine , including acupuncture , psychological interventions , routine vitamins , and yoga , have no reliable evidence to support their use in epilepsy .
melatonin , , is insufficiently supported by evidence .
the trials were of poor methodological quality and it was not possible to draw any definitive conclusions .
epilepsy cannot usually be cured , but medication can control seizures effectively in about *num* % of cases .
of those with generalized seizures , more than *num* % can be well controlled with medications while this is true in only *num* % of people with focal seizures .
one predictor of long-term outcome is the number of seizures that occur in the first six months .
other factors increasing the risk of a poor outcome include little response to the initial treatment , generalized seizures , a family history of epilepsy , psychiatric problems , and waves on the eeg representing generalized epileptiform activity .
in the developing world , *num* % of people are either untreated or not appropriately treated .
in africa , *num* % do not get treatment .
this is partly related to appropriate medications not being available or being too expensive .
people with epilepsy are at an increased risk of death .
this increase is between *num* .
*num* and *num* .
*num* fold greater than that of the general population .
the greatest increase in mortality from epilepsy is among the elderly .
those with epilepsy due to an unknown cause have little increased risk .
mortality is often related to : the underlying cause of the seizures , status epilepticus , suicide , trauma , and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy ( sudep ) .
death from status epilepticus is primarily due to an underlying problem rather than missing doses of medications .
the risk of suicide is between *num* and *num* times higher in those with epilepsy ; the cause of this is unclear .
sudep appears to be partly related to the frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and accounts for about *num* % of epilepsy-related deaths ; it is unclear how to decrease its risk .
in the united kingdom , it is estimated that 40–60 % of deaths are possibly preventable .
in the developing world , many deaths are due to untreated epilepsy leading to falls or status epilepticus .
epilepsy is one of the most common serious neurological disorders affecting about *num* million people .
it affects *num* % of the population by age *num* and *num* % of the population by age *num* .
it is more common in males than females with the overall difference being small .
most of those with the disorder ( *num* % ) are in the developing world .
the estimated prevalence of active epilepsy ( ) is in the range 3–10 per *num* , *num* , with active epilepsy defined as someone with epilepsy who has had a least one unprovoked seizure in the last five years .
epilepsy begins each year in 40–70 per *num* , *num* in developed countries and 80–140 per *num* , *num* in developing countries .
poverty is a risk and includes both being from a poor country and being poor relative to others within one's country .
in the developed world epilepsy most commonly starts either in the young or in the old .
in the developing world its onset is more common in older children and young adults due to the higher rates of trauma and infectious diseases .
in developed countries the number of cases a year has decreased in children and increased among the elderly between the 1970s and *num* .
this has been attributed partly to better survival following strokes in the elderly .
the oldest medical records show that epilepsy has been affecting people at least since the beginning of recorded history .
throughout ancient history , the disease was thought to be a spiritual condition .
the world's oldest description of an epileptic seizure comes from a text in akkadian ( a language used in ancient mesopotamia ) and was written around *num* bc .
the person described in the text was diagnosed as being under the influence of a moon god , and underwent an exorcism .
epileptic seizures are listed in the code of hammurabi ( c .
*num* bc ) as reason for which a purchased slave may be returned for a refund , and the edwin smith papyrus ( c .
*num* bc ) describes cases of individuals with epileptic convulsions .
the oldest known detailed record of the disease itself is in the " sakikku " , a babylonian cuneiform medical text from *num* bc .
this text gives signs and symptoms , details treatment and likely outcomes , and describes many features of the different seizure types .
as the babylonians had no biomedical understanding of the nature of disease , they attributed the seizures to possession by evil spirits and called for treating the condition through spiritual means .
around *num* bc , punarvasu atreya described epilepsy as loss of consciousness ; this definition was carried forward into the ayurvedic text of charaka samhita ( about *num* bc ) .
the ancient greeks had contradictory views of the disease .
they thought of epilepsy as a form of spiritual possession , but also associated the condition with genius and the divine .
one of the names they gave to it was the " sacred disease " ( ἠ ἱερὰ νόσος ) .
epilepsy appears within greek mythology : it is associated with the moon goddesses selene and artemis , who afflicted those who upset them .
the greeks thought that important figures such as julius caesar and hercules had the disease .
the notable exception to this divine and spiritual view was that of the school of hippocrates .
in the fifth century bc , hippocrates rejected the idea that the disease was caused by spirits .
in his landmark work " on the sacred disease " , he proposed that epilepsy was not divine in origin and instead was a medically treatable problem originating in the brain .
he accused those of attributing a sacred cause to the disease of spreading ignorance through a belief in superstitious magic .
hippocrates proposed that heredity was important as a cause , described worse outcomes if the disease presents at an early age , and made note of the physical characteristics as well as the social shame associated with it .
instead of referring to it as the " sacred disease " , he used the term " great disease " , giving rise to the modern term " grand mal " , used for tonic–clonic seizures .
despite his work detailing the physical origins of the disease , his view was not accepted at the time .
evil spirits continued to be blamed until at least the *ord* century .
in ancient rome people did not eat or drink with the same pottery as that used by someone who was affected .
people of the time would spit on their chest believing that this would keep the problem from affecting them .
according to apuleius and other ancient physicians , in order to detect epilepsy , it was common to light a piece of " gagates " , whose smoke would trigger the seizure .
occasionally a spinning potter's wheel was used , perhaps a reference to photosensitive epilepsy .
in most cultures , persons with epilepsy have been stigmatized , shunned , or even imprisoned ; in the salpêtrière , the birthplace of modern neurology , jean-martin charcot found people with epilepsy side-by-side with the mentally ill , those with chronic syphilis , and the criminally insane .
in ancient rome , epilepsy was known as the " morbus comitialis " ( ' disease of the assembly hall ' ) and was seen as a curse from the gods .
in northern italy , epilepsy was once traditionally known as saint valentine's malady .
in the mid-1800s , the first effective anti-seizure medication , bromide , was introduced .
the first modern treatment , phenobarbital , was developed in *num* , with phenytoin coming into use in *num* .
stigma is commonly experienced , around the world , by those with epilepsy .
it can affect people economically , socially and culturally .
in india and china , epilepsy may be used as justification to deny marriage .
people in some areas still believe those with epilepsy to be cursed .
in parts of africa , such as tanzania and uganda , epilepsy is incorrectly claimed to be associated with possession by evil spirits , witchcraft , or poisoning and is believed by many to be contagious .
before *num* in the united kingdom , epilepsy was considered grounds for the annulment of marriage .
the stigma may result in some people with epilepsy denying that they have ever had seizures .
seizures result in direct economic costs of about one billion dollars in the united states .
epilepsy resulted in economic costs in europe of around *num* .
*num* billion euros in *num* .
in india epilepsy is estimated to result in costs of us$1 .
*num* billion or *num* .
*num* % of the gdp .
it is the cause of about *num* % of emergency department visits ( *num* % for emergency departments for children ) in the united states .
those with epilepsy are at about twice the risk of being involved in a motor vehicular collision and thus in many areas of the world are not allowed to drive or only able to drive if certain conditions are met .
in some places physicians are required by law to report if a person has had a seizure to the licensing body while in others the requirement is only that they encourage the person in question to report it themselves .
countries that require physician reporting include sweden , austria , denmark and spain .
countries that require the individual to report include the uk and new zealand and the physician may report if they believe the individual has not already .
in canada , the united states and australia the requirements around reporting vary by province or state .
if seizures are well controlled most feel allowing driving is reasonable .
the amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country .
many countries require one to three years without seizures .
in the united states the time needed without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year .
those with epilepsy or seizures are typically denied a pilot license .
in canada if an individual has had no more than one seizure , they may be considered after five years for a limited license if all other testing is normal .
those with febrile seizures and drug related seizures may also be considered .
in the united states , the federal aviation administration does not allow those with epilepsy to get a commercial pilot license .
rarely , exceptions can be made for persons who have had an isolated seizure or febrile seizures and have remained free of seizures into adulthood without medication .
in the united kingdom , a full national private pilot license requires the same standards as a professional driver's license .
this requires a period of ten years without seizures while off medications .
those who do not meet this requirement may acquire a restricted license if free from seizures for five years .
there are organizations that provide support for people and families affected by epilepsy .
the " out of the shadows " campaign , a joint effort by the world health organization , the international league against epilepsy and the international bureau for epilepsy , provides help internationally .
the joint epilepsy council serves the uk and ireland .
in the united states , the epilepsy foundation is a national organization that works to increase the acceptance of those with the disorder , their ability to function in society and to promote research for a cure .
the epilepsy foundation , some hospitals , and some individuals also run support groups in the united states .
seizure prediction refers to attempts to forecast epileptic seizures based on the eeg before they occur .
, no effective mechanism to predict seizures has been developed .
kindling , where repeated exposures to events that could cause seizures eventually causes seizures more easily , has been used to create animal models of epilepsy .
gene therapy is being studied in some types of epilepsy .
medications that alter immune function , such as intravenous immunoglobulins , are poorly supported by evidence .
noninvasive stereotactic radiosurgery is , , being compared to standard surgery for certain types of epilepsy .
epilepsy occurs in a number of other animals including dogs and cats and is the most common brain disorder in dogs .
it is typically treated with anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital or bromide in dogs and phenobarbital in cats .
imepitoin is also used in dogs .
while generalized seizures in horses are fairly easy to diagnose , it may be more difficult in non-generalized seizures and eegs may be useful .
abbas mirza abbas mirza ( ) ( august *num* , 1789october *num* , *num* ) , was a qajar crown prince of persia .
he developed a reputation as a military commander during the russo-persian war of 1804-1813 and the russo-persian war of 1826-1828 with neighbouring imperial russia , as well as through the ottoman-persian war of 1821-1823 with the ottoman empire .
he is furthermore noted as an early modernizer of persia's armed forces and institutions , and for his death before his father , fath ali shah .
abbas was an intelligent prince , possessed some literary taste , and is noteworthy on account of the comparative simplicity of his life .
nevertheless , with abbas mirza as the military commander of the persian forces , iran lost all of its territories in the caucasus comprising transcaucasia and parts of the north caucasus ( dagestan ) to russia in conformity with the *num* treaty of gulistan and the *num* treaty of turkmenchay , following the outcomes of the 1804–1813 and 1826–1828 wars .
abbas mirza was born on august *num* , *num* in nava , mazandaran .
he was a younger son of fath ali shah , but on account of his mother's royal birth was destined by his father to succeed him .
considered the favorite son by his father , he was named governor ( " beglarbeg " ) of the azerbaijan region of persia , in approximately *num* , when he was *num* years old .
in *num* , three years after agha mohammad khan's death , the russians capitalized on the moment , and annexed kartli-kakheti .
as ( eastern ) georgia had been under intermittent iranian suzerainty since the early *ord* century , this act by the russians was seen as intrusion into iranian territory .
in *num* , eager to take the rest of iran's territories , the russian army led by general pavel tsitsianov , besieged , captured and sacked the city of ganja , thereby initiating the russo-persian war ( 1804–13 ) .
fath-ali shah appointed abbas mirza as commander of the expeditionary force of *num* , *num* men .
his aid was eagerly solicited by both england and napoleon , anxious to checkmate one another in the east , especially as persia bordered a common rival , namely imperial russia .
preferring the friendship of france , abbas mirza continued the war against russia's young general kotlyarevsky , aged only twenty-nine but his new ally could give him very little assistance .
the early stages of the war following fath ali shah's orders to invade and regain georgia and the northern parts of the contemporary azerbaijani republic ended up in years of relatively territorial stale warfare .
however , as prof .
alexander mikaberidze adds , abbas mirza led the army in an overall disastrous campaign against the russians , suffering defeats at gyumri , kalagiri , the zagam river ( *num* ) , karakapet ( *num* ) , karababa ( *num* ) , ganja ( *num* ) , meghri , the aras river , and akhalkalaki ( *num* ) .
the tide started to decisively turn as russia was sending more and more advanced weaponry and increasing numbers of soldiers .
commanding the southernmost russian divisions during the long war , kotlyarevsky defeated the numerically superior persian army in the battle of aslanduz ( *num* ) and in early *num* stormed and took lankaran .
the russians were encamped on the opposite bank of river aras when his two british advisers capt christie and lt pottinger told him to post sentry pickets in short order , but mirza ignored the warnings .
christie and other british officers tried to rally an army retreating in panic ; for days the russians launched fierce assaults , but at last christie fell , and mirza ordered a full retreat .
complacency cost *num* , *num* persian lives ; mirza believing wrongly in the weight of superior numbers .
in spite of the absence of leadership , the persians at lenkoran held out for weeks , until breaking through the russians slaughtered the garrison of *num* , *num* officers and men .
in october *num* , with abbas mirza still commander-in-chief , persia was compelled to make a severely disadvantageous peace known as the treaty of gulistan , irrevocably ceding swaths of its territory in the caucasus , comprising present-day georgia , dagestan , and most of what most recently became the republic of azerbaijan .
the only promise the shah received in return was a lukewarm guarantee the mirza would succeed to his throne , without let or hindrance .
persia's dire losses attracted the attention of the british empire ; following the reversal of initial successes , the russians now posed a serious threat from the caucasus .
the drastic losses suffered by his forces made him realize that he needed to train persia's military in the european style of war , and he started sending his students to europe for military training .
by introducing european-style regiments , abbas mirza believed it would enable iran to gain the upper hand over russia and to reclaim its lost territories .
influenced by sultan selim iii's reforms , abbas mirza set out to create an iranian version of the ottoman " nizam-ı cedid " , and reduce the qajar dependence on tribal and provincial forces .
in *num* and *num* , two groups were sent to britain , and in *num* a printing press was finished in tabriz as a means to reproduce european military handbooks .
tabriz also saw a gunpowder factory and a munitions depot .
the training continued with constant drilling by british advisers , with a focus on the infantry and artillery .
he received his opportunity to test his newly reformed military when the ottoman–persian war ( 1821–1823 ) began , and they proved themselves adept with several victories .
this resulted in a peace treaty signed in *num* after the battle of erzurum .
the war was a victory for persia , especially considering they were outnumbered , and this gave much needed confidence to his forces .
his second war with russia , which began in *num* , started off on a good note as he won back most of the territory lost in the russo-persian war ( 1804–13 ) ; however it ended in a string of costly defeats after which persia was forced to cede the last of its caucasian territories , comprising all of what is modern day armenia , nakhchivan , the rest of the remainder of the contemporary azerbaijani republic that was still in iranian hands , and igdir province , all conform the *num* treaty of turkmenchay .
the eventual loss was due less to his and his armies skill and more to do with lack of reinforcements and overwhelming superiority in numbers .
the irrevocable losses , which in total amounted up for all of qajar iran's territories in the north caucasus and the south caucasus , affected abbas mirza severely and his health began to suffer .
he also lost enthusiasm for any more military reform .
in *num* , he sought to restore order in the province of khorasan , which was nominally under persian supremacy , and while engaged in the task died at mashhad in *num* .
in *num* his eldest son , mohammed mirza , succeeded fath ali shah as the next king .
r .
g .
watson ( history of persia , 128-9 ) describes him as “the noblest of the qajar race” .
he is most remembered for his valor in battle and his failed attempts to modernize the persian army .
he was not successful in part due to the lack of government centralization in iran during the era .
furthermore , it was abbas mirza who first dispatched iranian students to europe for a western education .
he was unable to prove successful in the long run in his wars with russia as he ended up losing more territory than he gained .
economy of cameroon for a quarter of a century following independence , cameroon was one of the most prosperous countries in africa .
the drop in commodity prices for its principal exports —petroleum , cocoa , coffee , and cotton — in the mid-1980s , combined with an overvalued currency and economic mismanagement , led to a decade-long recession .
real per capita gdp fell by more than *num* % from *num* to *num* .
the current account and fiscal deficits widened , and foreign debt grew .
yet because of its oil reserves and favorable agricultural conditions , cameroon still has one of the best-endowed primary commodity economies in sub-saharan africa .
cameroon’s financial system is the largest in the cemac region .
access to financial services is limited , particularly for smes .
aside from a traditional tendency for banks to prefer dealing with large , established companies , determining factors are also found in interest rates for loans to smes being capped at *num* percent and being heavily taxed .
as of *num* , bank loans to smes hardly reached *num* percent of total outstanding loans .
less than *num* percent of cameroonians have access to a bank account .
while the microfinance sector is consequently becoming increasingly important , its development is hampered by a loose regulatory and supervisory framework for microfinance institutions ( mfis ) .
the banking sector is highly concentrated and dominated by foreign commercial banks .
*num* out of the *num* largest commercial banks are foreign-owned , and the three largest banks hold more than *num* percent of total financial system assets .
while foreign banks generally display good solvency ratios , small domestic banks are in a much weaker position .
their capitalization is well below the average of banks in the cemac region and their profits are close to *num* percent , compared to *num* percent for foreign banks in the country .
this is partially explained by the high levels of non-performing loans , which reached *num* percent in *num* , leading to most banks holding large amounts of excess reserves as a percentage of deposits and large levels of unutilized liquidity .
in *num* , cameroon's financial system is being requested by the international monetary fund ( imf ) to increase its tax base to cover the losses from the north-west and south-west cameroon's regions instabilities , the loss of oil revenue , the failure to deliver on port facilities , and the decline in oil production from mature oil fields .
recent signs , however , are encouraging .
as of march *num* , cameroon's fifth imf program — a 3-year enhanced structural adjustment program approved in august *num* — is on track .
cameroon has rescheduled its paris club debt at favorable terms .
gdp has grown by about *num* % a year beginning in *num* .
there is cautious optimism that cameroon is emerging from its long period of economic hardship .
the enhanced structural adjustment facility ( esaf ) signed recently by the imf and government of cameroon calls for greater macroeconomic planning and financial accountability ; privatization of most of cameroon's nearly *num* remaining non-financial parastatal enterprises ; elimination of state marketing board monopolies on the export of cocoa , certain coffees , and cotton ; privatization and price competition in the banking sector ; implementation of the *num* labor code ; a vastly improved judicial system ; and political liberalization to boost investment .
france is cameroon's main trading partner and source of private investment and foreign aid .
cameroon has an investment guaranty agreement and a bilateral accord with the united states .
usa investment in cameroon is about $1 million , most of it in the oil sector .
inflation has been brought back under control .
cameroon aims at becoming emerging by *num* .
this is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of cameroon at market prices estimated by the international monetary fund with figures in millions of central african cfa francs .
the government embarked upon a series of economic reform programs supported by the world bank and international monetary fund ( imf ) beginning in the late 1980s .
many of these measures have been painful ; the government slashed civil service salaries by *num* % in *num* .
the cfa franc — the common currency of cameroon and *num* other african states — was devalued by *num* % in january *num* .
the government failed to meet the conditions of the first four imf programs .
the following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2017 .
aberdour aberdour ( ; , ) is a scenic and historic village on the south coast of fife , scotland .
it is on the north shore of the firth of forth , looking south to the island of inchcolm and its abbey , and to leith and edinburgh beyond .
according to the *num* census , the village has a population of *num* , *num* .
the village's winding high street lies a little inland from the coast .
narrow lanes run off it , providing access to the more hidden parts of the village and the shoreline itself .
the village nestles between the bigger coastal towns of burntisland to the east and dalgety bay to the west .
the parish of aberdour takes its name from this village , and had a population of *num* , *num* at the *num* census .
the origins of the village lie with its harbour , where the dour burn enters the river forth .
the place-name itself is pictish , implying an origin in the dark ages : " aber " ' confluence ' .
the -dour element , referring to the burn , means simply ' water ' ( archaic " dobur " ) , and is unconnected to the scots / english ' dour ' .
for much of its history aberdour was two villages , wester aberdour and easter aberdour , on either side of the dour burn ; however this distinction was blurred by the *ord* century arrival of the railway .
in the *ord* century aberdour's harbour was improved by the addition of a stone pier to help handle the coal traffic from nearby collieries .
however , in the 1850s the traffic changed dramatically , and aberdour harbour became a popular destination for pleasure steamers from leith .
this in turn led to the building of a deeper water pier a little around the bay at hawkcraig , and to the development of hotels and many of the other services still on view today in the village .
the railway came to aberdour in *num* , with the building of the line east from the newly opened forth bridge .
the station has won many " best kept station " awards .
the half an hour journey to the centre of edinburgh helped build on the existing popularity of the village , though it put the steamers out of business .
the main result was a growth in the building of large and attractive houses , especially down the hill from wester aberdour to the west sands .
ticket inspectors on the train line through aberdour were known for their sing song refrain : " "half an hour , half an hour , half an hour to aberdour — tickets please .
" " virtually between the two former settlements , though actually part of easter aberdour , lies aberdour castle .
this started life as a modest hall house on a site overlooking the dour burn in the *ord* century .
the oldest part of the present semi-ruin constitutes one of the earliest surviving stone castles in mainland scotland .
over the next four hundred years the castle was successively developed according to contemporary architectural ideas .
notable are the parts , still largely roofed , built by the earls of morton , with refined renaissance detail , in the second half of the *ord* century .
a fire in the late *ord* century was followed by some repairs , but in *num* the family purchased *ord* century aberdour house , on the west side of the burn and in wester aberdour , and the medieval castle was allowed to fall into relative decay .
aberdour castle is now in the care of historic scotland and open to the public ( entrance charge ) .
after a period of dereliction aberdour house was developed for residential use in the early 1990s .
neighbouring st fillan's church is one of the best-preserved medieval parish churches in scotland , dating largely to the *ord* century .
a south arcade was added to the nave in the early *ord* century ( open in summer ) .
the a921 , the main road along the south coast of fife , leads down the high street of wester aberdour , before kinking sharply left to cross the railway line , then right again to progress through easter aberdour's main street .
wester aberdour has the more ' olde worlde ' feel of the two , with the narrower through road more closely hemmed in by shops and hotels .
a number of vernacular buildings of the 17th-early *ord* centuries add to the historic scene .
close to the railway bridge , three lanes continue eastwards , presumably once the route of the original high street before the arrival of the railway .
one now leads to aberdour railway station , a beautifully kept and cared for example of a traditional station , in keeping with its role of transporting at least a quarter of the village's working population to their work each day .
a second lane leads alongside the railway line to aberdour castle , while a third leads to the restored aberdour house .
a little further west , a narrow road closely lined with high walls , shore road , leads down to the west sands and the harbour .
for many this area is the highlight of any visit to aberdour ; parking at the foot of shore road is usually at a premium .
another road leads coastwards from easter aberdour .
hawkcraig road leads past st fillan's church and through silversand park , home to aberdour shinty club , en route to the much better parking area on hawkcraig .
this was formerly a sandstone quarry and then used as the council refuse tip before becoming a carpark , part of the overgrown and rocky bluff separating aberdour's two bays .
from here is it a short walk to the silver sands , aberdour's busiest and most popular beach .
on the west side of hawkcraig point there is a short concrete jetty that was used as part of the development of radio controlled torpedoes during world war one .
the foundations of the radio hut can still be seen in the lea of the hill .
the aberdour obelisk was built by lord morton on his departure from the village to relocate to a large home in edinburgh , it was built so he could see his former hometown from his new house when he looked through binoculars - it stands in a cowfield between the castle and the beach .
aberdour hosts an annual festival , which runs from late july to early august and features musical events , shows , sporting events and children's events .
aberdour was a *num* finalist in the prestigious " beautiful scotland in bloom " awards .
it was nominated for " "best coastal resort" " in scotland along with st andrews in fife , north berwick in east lothian , and rothesay in argyll and bute .
in *num* aberdour was voted best coastal village in fife and best small coastal village in scotland .
it also received a gold award in beautiful fife and beautiful scotland .
in *num* aberdour was voted the second-best place to live in scotland by the sunday times list of best places to live aberdour is home to fife's only senior shinty club .
aberdour shinty club field teams in both the men's and women's senior national leagues .
aberdour has two beaches - the silver sands , and the black sands .
the silver sands are located on the east side of the village , and has previously held a " blue flag " beach award , which denotes an exemplary standard of cleanliness , facilities , safety , environmental education and management .
new facilities are currently under construction by fife council , which will much improve the beach throughout the year .
the black sands ( also known as the west beach ) , as the contrasting name would suggest , have a rockier and darker sand , and are also popular with visitors exploring the rock caves and fascinating sea life .
during the summer months ( april–september ) , dogs are banned from the silver sands but they are allowed all year round at the west beach .
the two beaches are linked by part of the fife coastal path which also takes you past the harbour and the hawkcraig - a popular rock climbing location .
silver sands is becoming more popular with open water swimmers , who swim daily in the sea , both as a leisure pursuit , and as training for open water competition .
the bay provides safety from the currents , although only the adventurous swim round to the harbour .
several scenes of richard jobson's *num* movie " *num* years of alcohol " were filmed at the black sands in aberdour .
the island of inchcolm , or island ( gaelic " innis " ) of columba , a quarter of a mile from the shore , forms part of the parish of aberdour .
its name implies associations dating back to the time of columba and , although undocumented before the *ord* century , it may have served the monks of the columban family as an ' iona of the east ' from early times .
during the first and second world wars , inchcolm was occupied by the army as part of the defences of the firth of forth .
there are extensive remains of gun emplacements , barracks , etc .
from these periods .
the island is notable for its wildlife , especially seabirds and seals .
these draw many visitors in summer , along with the remains of the historic abbey , and is a popular setting for weddings .
escape from new york escape from new york is a *num* american post-apocalyptic science-fiction action film co-written , co-scored and directed by john carpenter .
the film is set in what was then the near-future year of *num* , in a crime-ridden united states that has converted manhattan island in new york city into the country's maximum security prison .
when air force one is hijacked by terrorists and crashes into new york city , ex-soldier and federal prisoner snake plissken ( kurt russell ) is given *num* hours to rescue the president of the united states .
carpenter wrote the film in the mid-1970s in reaction to the watergate scandal .
after the success of " halloween " , he had enough influence to begin production and filmed it mainly in st .
louis , missouri on an estimated budget of $6 million .
debra hill and larry j .
franco served as the producers .
the film was co-written by nick castle , who had collaborated with carpenter by portraying michael myers in " halloween " .
"escape from new york " was released in the united states on july *num* , *num* .
the film received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success , grossing over $25 million at the box office .
the film was nominated for four saturn awards , including best science fiction film and best direction .
the film became a cult classic and was followed by a sequel , " escape from l .
a .
" ( *num* ) , which was also directed and written by carpenter and starred russell but was much less favorably received .
in *num* , following a *num* % increase in crime , the united states government has turned manhattan into a giant maximum-security prison .
a containment wall surrounds the island , and routes out of manhattan have been dismantled or mined , while armed helicopters patrol the rivers , and all prisoners there are sentenced to life , with no means of leaving .
in *num* , nato is engaged in an escalating war with the ussr across much of europe , which threatens to imminently become a global nuclear holocaust .
while traveling to a peace summit between the united states , china and the soviet union , air force one is hijacked by a domestic terrorist posing as a stewardess .
the president is given a tracking bracelet and his briefcase ( containing an audiotape describing the secret to using nuclear fusion for power generation ) handcuffed to his wrist — a move which could defuse hostilities and bring peace between the superpowers .
he makes it to an escape pod , and lands in manhattan just before air force one crashes , killing everyone else aboard .
police are dispatched to rescue the president .
however , romero , the right-hand man of the duke of new york ( the top crime boss in the prison ) warns them that the duke has taken the president hostage , and that he will be killed if any further rescue attempts are mounted .
commissioner bob hauk offers a deal to snake plissken , a former special forces soldier convicted of attempting to rob the federal reserve in denver , colorado : if snake rescues the president and retrieves the cassette tape , hauk will arrange a presidential pardon .
to ensure his compliance , hauk has plissken injected with micro-explosives that will rupture snake's carotid arteries within *num* hours ; if snake returns with the president and the tape in time , hauk will have the explosives neutralized .
snake is sent into manhattan in a stealth glider , landing atop the world trade center .
snake tracks the president's life-monitor bracelet to a vaudeville theater , only to find it on the wrist of an insane old man .
convinced that the president has been killed , he radios hauk , only to be told that he will be shot down if he tries to come back out empty-handed .
soon afterwards he meets " cabbie , " a long-serving new york taxi-driver who has been driving the streets of manhattan for *num* years and somehow managed to remain in the city after its conversion to an open prison .
cabbie takes snake in his armored taxi cab to harold " brain " hellman , an adviser to the duke and a former associate of snake's , who is a brilliant engineer and has established a base in new york central library with an oil-pumping engine and a small refinery , which keeps the remainder of the city's cars and machinery running .
hellman betrayed snake during a long-ago robbery plot and snake is tempted to shoot him , but brain tells snake that the duke plans to unify the gangs in a mass exodus across the heavily guarded queensboro bridge , using the president as a human shield and a map brain has created to avoid the landmines .
snake backs off , but forces brain and his girlfriend maggie to lead him to the duke's compound at grand central terminal .
he finds the president , but is captured by the duke's men .
while snake is forced to fight in a deathmatch with slag , a prisoner , brain and maggie kill romero and flee with the president .
as snake kills slag , the duke learns of brain's treachery and rallies his gang to chase them .
snake , brain , maggie , and the president race to the world trade center in an attempt to use snake's glider to escape from manhattan .
after a group of crazies destroy it , the group returns to the street and encounters cabbie , who offers to take them across the bridge .
when cabbie reveals that he has the secret tape ( having traded it to romero earlier for his hat ) , the president demands it , but snake keeps it .
the duke pursues the group onto the bridge in his customised cadillac , setting off mines as he tries to catch up .
with brain navigating through the minefield , snake manages to avoid most of the explosives , but the cab hits a mine and is blown in half , killing cabbie .
as the group flees on foot , brain is killed when he steps on another mine .
maggie refuses to leave him .
she stands in the middle of the road , shooting at the duke's car until he runs her down , killing her .
snake and the president reach the perimeter wall , and the guards raise the president on a rope .
the duke opens fire on the wall , killing the guards and forcing snake to dive for cover , but the president shoots the duke dead with one of the guard's machine guns .
snake is lifted to safety , and the micro-explosives in his neck are neutralized .
as the president prepares for a televised speech to the leaders at the summit meeting , he thanks snake for saving him and tells him that he can have anything he wants .
all snake asks for is how he feels about the people who died saving him , but the president only offers half-hearted regret .
as snake walks away in disgust , hauk offers snake a job as his deputy — snake demurs , neither saying yes or no .
the president's speech commences , and he offers the contents of the cassette ; to his embarrassment , the tape is cabbie's cassette of the song " bandstand boogie " .
as snake walks away , he intentionally tears the magnetic tape out of the cassette reel , with the actual message that was intended to be delivered by the president .
carpenter originally wrote the screenplay for " escape from new york " in *num* , in the aftermath of the watergate scandal .
carpenter said , " the whole feeling of the nation was one of real cynicism about the president .
i wrote the screenplay and no studio wanted to make it " because , according to carpenter , " it was too dark , too violent , too scary , and too weird .
" he had been inspired by the film " death wish " , which was very popular at the time .
he did not agree with this film's philosophy but liked how it conveyed " the sense of new york as a kind of jungle , and i wanted to make a science fiction film along these lines " .
avco embassy pictures , the film's financial backer , preferred either charles bronson or tommy lee jones to play the role of snake plissken to carpenter's choice of kurt russell , who was trying to overcome the " lightweight " screen image conveyed by his roles in several disney comedies .
carpenter refused to cast bronson on the grounds that he was too old , and because he worried that he could lose directorial control over the picture with an experienced actor .
at the time , russell described his character as " a mercenary , and his style of fighting is a combination of bruce lee , the exterminator , and darth vader , with eastwood's vocal-ness .
" all that matters to snake , according to the actor , is " the next *num* seconds .
living for exactly that next minute is all there is .
" russell used a rigorous diet and exercise program in order to develop a lean and muscular build .
he also endeavored to stay in character between takes and throughout the shooting , as he welcomed the opportunity to get away from the disney comedies he had done previously .
he did find it necessary to remove the eyepatch between takes , as wearing it constantly seriously affected his depth perception .
carpenter had just made " dark star " but no one wanted to hire him as a director , so he assumed he would make it in hollywood as a screenwriter .
the filmmaker went on to do other films with the intention of making " escape " later .
after the success of " halloween " , avco-embassy signed him and producer debra hill to a two-picture deal .
the first film from this contract was " the fog " .
initially , the second film he was going to make to finish the contract was " the philadelphia experiment " , but because of script-writing problems , carpenter rejected it in favor of this project .
however , carpenter felt something was missing and recalls , " this was basically a straight action film .
and at one point , i realized it really doesn't have this kind of crazy humor that people from new york would expect to see .
" he brought in nick castle , a friend from his film school days at university of southern california who played " the shape " in " halloween " .
castle invented the cabbie character and came up with the film's ending .
the film's setting proved to be a potential problem for carpenter , who needed to create a decaying , semi-destroyed version of new york city on a shoe-string budget .
he and the film's production designer joe alves rejected shooting on location in new york city because it would be too hard to make it look like a destroyed city .
carpenter suggested shooting on a movie back lot but alves nixed that idea " because the texture of a real street is not like a back lot .
" they sent barry bernardi , their location manager ( and associate producer ) , " on a sort of all-expense-paid trip across the country looking for the worst city in america , " producer debra hill remembers .
bernardi suggested east st .
louis , illinois , because it was filled with old buildings " that exist in new york now , and [ that ] have that seedy run-down quality " that the team was looking for .
east st .
louis , sitting across the mississippi river from the more prosperous st .
louis , missouri , had entire neighborhoods burned out in *num* during a massive urban fire .
hill said in an interview , " block after block was burnt-out rubble .
in some places there was absolutely nothing , so that you could see three and four blocks away .
" as well , alves found an old bridge to double for the " *ord* st .
bridge " .
the filmmaker purchased the old chain of rocks bridge for one dollar from the government and then gave it back to them , for the same amount , once production was completed , " so that they wouldn't have any liability , " hill remembers .
locations across the river in st .
louis , missouri were used , including union station and the fox theatre , both of which have since been renovated , as well as the building which would eventually become the schlafly tap room microbrewery .
carpenter and his crew persuaded the city to shut off the electricity to ten blocks at a time at night .
the film was shot from august to november *num* .
it was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls .
" we'd finish shooting at about *num* am and i'd just be going to sleep at *num* when the sun would be coming up .
i'd wake up around *num* or *num* pm , depending on whether or not we had dailies , and by the time i got going , the sun would be setting .
so for about two and a half months i never saw daylight , which was really strange .
" the gladiatorial fight to the death scene between snake and slag ( played by professional wrestler ox baker ) was filmed in the grand hall at st .
louis union station .
russell has stated , " that day was a nightmare .
all i did was swing a [ spiked ] bat at that guy and get swung at in return .
he threw a trash can in my face about five times .
.
.
i could have wound up in pretty bad shape .
" in addition to shooting on location in st .
louis , carpenter shot parts of the film in los angeles .
various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage ; the final scenes were shot at the sepulveda dam , in sherman oaks .
new york served as a location , as did atlanta , to use their futuristic-looking rapid-transit system .
in new york city , carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to liberty island .
" we were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on liberty island at the statue of liberty at night .
they let us have the whole island to ourselves .
we were lucky .
it wasn't easy to get that initial permission .
they'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble " .
carpenter was interested in creating two distinct looks for the movie .
" one is the police state , high tech , lots of neon , a united states dominated by underground computers .
that was easy to shoot compared to the manhattan island prison sequences which had few lights , mainly torch lights , like feudal england " .
certain matte paintings were rendered by james cameron , who was at the time a special effects artist with roger corman's new world pictures .
cameron was also one of the directors of photography on the film .
as snake pilots the glider into the city , there are three screens on his control panel displaying wireframe animations of the landing target on the world trade center and surrounding buildings .
carpenter wanted high-tech computer graphics , which were very expensive , even for such a simple animation .
the effects crew filmed the miniature model set of new york city they used for other scenes under black light , with reflective tape placed along every edge of the model buildings .
only the tape is visible and appears to be a 3d wireframe animation .
"escape from new york " opened in new york and los angeles july *num* , *num* .
the film grossed $25 .
*num* million in american theaters in summer *num* .
the film received generally positive reviews .
as of april *num* , *num* , it had a rating of *num* % on rotten tomatoes , with the critical consensus " featuring an atmospherically grimy futuristic metropolis , " escape from new york " is a strange , entertaining jumble of thrilling action and oddball weirdness " .
" newsweek " magazine wrote of carpenter " [ he has a ] deeply ingrained b-movie sensibility - which is both his strength and limitation .
he does clean work , but settles for too little .
he uses russell well , however " .
in " time " magazine , richard corliss wrote , " john carpenter is offering this summer's moviegoers a rare opportunity : to escape from the air-conditioned torpor of ordinary entertainment into the hothouse humidity of their own paranoia .
it's a trip worth taking " .
vincent canby , in his review for " the new york times " , wrote , " [ the film ] is not to be analyzed too solemnly , though .
it's a toughly told , very tall tale , one of the best escape ( and escapist ) movies of the season .
" in his review for the " chicago reader " , dave kehr , wrote " it fails to satisfy–it gives us too little of too much " .
cyberpunk pioneer william gibson credits the film as an influence on his novel " neuromancer " .
" i was intrigued by the exchange in one of the opening scenes where the warden says to snake ' you flew the gullfire over leningrad , didn't you ? ' it turns out to be just a throwaway line , but for a moment it worked like the best sf where a casual reference can imply a lot .
" popular videogame director hideo kojima has referred to the film frequently as an influence on his work , in particular the " metal gear " series .
solid snake is partially influenced by snake plissken .
in " metal gear solid *num* : sons of liberty " snake uses the alias " pliskin " to hide his real identity during most of the game .
j .

abrams , producer of the *num* film " cloverfield " , mentioned that a scene in his film , which shows the head of the statue of liberty crashing into a new york street , was inspired by the poster for " escape from new york " .

in *num* , bantam books published a movie tie-in novelization written by mike mcquay that adopts a lean , humorous style reminiscent of the film .
the novel is significant because it includes scenes that were cut out of the film , such as the federal reserve depository robbery that results in snake's incarceration .
the novel provides motivation and backstory to snake and hauk — both disillusioned war veterans — deepening their relationship that was only hinted at it in the film .
the novel explains how snake lost his eye during the battle for leningrad in world war iii , how hauk became warden of new york , and hauk's quest to find his crazy son who lives somewhere in the prison .
the novel fleshes out the world that these characters exist in , at times presenting a future even bleaker than the one depicted in the film .
the book explains that the west coast is a no-man's land , and the country's population is gradually being driven crazy by nerve gas as a result of world war iii .

full metal jacket full metal jacket is a *num* war film directed , co-written , and produced by stanley kubrick and starring matthew modine , r .
lee ermey , vincent d'onofrio and adam baldwin .
the screenplay by kubrick , michael herr , and gustav hasford was based on hasford's novel " the short-timers " ( *num* ) .
the storyline follows a platoon of u .
s .
marines through their training , primarily focusing on two privates , joker and pyle , who struggle to get through boot camp under their abusive drill instructor , gunnery sergeant hartman , and the experiences of two of the platoon's marines in the tet offensive during the vietnam war .
the film's title refers to the full metal jacket bullet used by soldiers .
the film was released in the united states on june *num* , *num* .
it was the last of kubrick's films to be released during his lifetime .
"full metal jacket " received critical acclaim and an academy award nomination for best adapted screenplay for kubrick , herr , and hasford .
in *num* , the american film institute placed it at no .
*num* in their " afi's *num* years .

.
*num* thrills " poll .
during the united states ' involvement in the vietnam war , a group of marine corps recruits arrive at parris island , south carolina , for boot camp .
the ruthless drill instructor , hartman employs forceful methods to turn the recruits into combat-ready marines .
among the recruits are privates " joker " , " cowboy " , and the overweight and dim-witted leonard lawrence , whom hartman nicknames " gomer pyle " .
pyle is initially inept at basic training , but slowly improves after hartman pairs him with joker .
however , when hartman discovers a contraband doughnut in pyle's foot locker , he adopts a collective punishment policy , punishing the rest of the platoon for pyle's mistakes .
one night , the recruits haze pyle with a blanket party ; joker reluctantly participates .
following this incident , pyle reinvents himself as a model recruit and shows particular expertise in marksmanship .
this impresses hartman , but worries joker , who notices pyle talking to his rifle and believes that he may be suffering a mental breakdown .
the recruits graduate and receive their military occupational specialty assignments .
joker is assigned to military journalism , while most of the others – including cowboy and pyle – are assigned to infantry .
during the platoon's final night on parris island , joker discovers pyle in the bathroom loading his rifle .
pyle executes drill commands and loudly recites the rifleman's creed , waking the others , including hartman , who storms into the bathroom , insults pyle and orders him to surrender the rifle .
pyle shoots hartman dead and then kills himself , while joker watches in horror .
in january *num* , joker – now a sergeant – is a war correspondent in south vietnam for " stars and stripes " with private first class rafterman , a combat photographer .
rafterman wants to go into combat , as joker claims he has .
at the marine base , joker is mocked for his lack of the thousand-yard stare , indicating his lack of war experience .
they are interrupted by the start of the tet offensive as the north vietnamese army unsuccessfully attempts to overrun the base .
the following day , the journalism staff is briefed about enemy attacks throughout south vietnam .
joker is sent to phu bai , accompanied by rafterman .
they meet the lusthog squad , where joker is reunited with cowboy .
joker accompanies the squad during the battle of huế , where platoon commander " touchdown " is killed by the enemy .
after the marines declare the area secure , a team of american news journalists and reporters enter huế and interviews various marines about their experiences in vietnam and their opinions about the war .
while patrolling huế , crazy earl , the squad leader , is killed by a booby trap , leaving cowboy in command .
the squad becomes lost , and cowboy orders eightball to scout the area .
a viet cong sniper wounds eightball and doc jay , the squad medic .
cowboy learns that tank support is unavailable and orders the team to prepare for withdrawal .
the squad's machine gunner , " animal mother " , disobeys cowboy and attempts to save his comrades .
he discovers there is only one sniper , but doc jay and eightball are killed when doc jay attempts to indicate the sniper's location .
while maneuvering toward the sniper , cowboy is shot and killed .
animal mother assumes command of the squad and leads an attack on the sniper .
joker discovers the sniper , a teenage girl , and attempts to shoot her , but his rifle jams and alerts her to his presence .
rafterman shoots the sniper , mortally wounding her .
as the squad converges , the sniper first prays and then the sniper begs for death saying " shoot me , shoot me " prompting an argument about whether or not to kill her or " let her rot " said by animal mother .
animal mother decides to allow a mercy killing only if joker performs it .
after some hesitation , joker shoots her .
the marines congratulate him on his kill as joker stares into the distance .
the marines march toward their camp , singing the " mickey mouse march " .
joker states in narration that despite being " in a world of shit " , he is glad to be alive and is no longer afraid .
additional characters include : peter edmund as private " snowball " brown , one of the parris island recruits ; ed o'ross as lieutenant walter j .
" touchdown " schinoski , the platoon leader of the lusthog squad ; john terry as lieutenant lockhart , the editor of " stars and stripes " ; kieron jecchinis as crazy earl , a member and also a former leader of the lusthog squad ; jon stafford as doc jay , head medic of the lusthog squad and bruce boa as poge colonel , the colonel who dresses down joker for wearing a peace symbol on his lapel .

rock and donlon respectively , two members of the lusthog squad .
papillon soo soo plays a da nang hooker and ngoc le appears as the viet cong sniper .
stanley kubrick and his daughter vivian make uncredited appearances as two photographers at a vietnam massacre site .
kubrick contacted michael herr , author of the vietnam war memoir " dispatches " ( *num* ) , in the spring of *num* to discuss working on a film about the holocaust , but he eventually discarded that in favor of a film about the vietnam war .
they met in england , and the director told herr that he wanted to do a war film but had yet to find a story to adapt .
kubrick discovered gustav hasford's novel " the short-timers " ( *num* ) while reading the " virginia kirkus review .
" herr received it in bound galleys and thought that it was a masterpiece .
in *num* , kubrick read the novel twice , concluding that it " was a unique , absolutely wonderful book " , and decided , along with herr , to adapt it for his next film .
according to kubrick , he was drawn to the book's dialogue , finding it " almost poetic in its carved-out , stark quality " .
in *num* , kubrick began conducting research for the film , watching past footage and documentaries , reading vietnamese newspapers on microfilm from the library of congress , and studying hundreds of photographs from the era .
initially , herr was not interested in revisiting his vietnam war experiences , and kubrick spent three years persuading him to participate in what the author describes as " a single phone call lasting three years , with interruptions " .
in *num* , kubrick contacted hasford to work on the screenplay with him and herr , and often talked to hasford on the phone three to four times a week , for hours at a time .
kubrick had already written a detailed treatment , and kubrick and herr got together at kubrick's home every day , breaking down the treatment into scenes .
from that , herr wrote the first draft .
the filmmaker worried that the book's title might be misread by audiences as referring to people who only did half a day's work and changed it to " full metal jacket " after discovering the phrase while going through a gun catalogue .
after the first draft was completed , kubrick phoned in his orders , and hasford and herr mailed their submissions to him .
kubrick read and edited them , and then the team repeated the process .
neither hasford nor herr knew how much he had contributed to the screenplay , which led to a dispute over the final credits .
hasford remembers , " we were like guys on an assembly line in the car factory .
i was putting on one widget and michael was putting on another widget and stanley was the only one who knew that this was going to end up being a car .
" herr says the director was not interested in making an anti-war film , but " he wanted to show what war is like " .
at some point , kubrick wanted to meet hasford in person , but herr advised against this , describing " the short-timers " author as a " scary man " and believing he and kubrick would not " get on " .
nonetheless , kubrick insisted , and they all met at kubrick's house in england for dinner .
it did not go well , and hasford did not meet with kubrick again .
through warner bros .
, kubrick advertised a national casting search in the united states and canada .
the director used videotape to audition actors and received over *num* , *num* submissions .
his staff screened all of the tapes , leaving *num* of them for kubrick to review personally .
former u .
s .
marine drill instructor ermey , originally hired as a technical advisor , asked kubrick if he could audition for the role of hartman .
kubrick had seen ermey's portrayal of drill instructor staff sergeant loyce in " the boys in company c " ( *num* ) and told the marine that he was not vicious enough to play the character .
ermey improvised insulting dialogue against a group of royal marines who were being considered for the part of background marines , to demonstrate his ability to play the character , as well as to show how a drill instructor goes about breaking down the individuality of new recruits .
upon viewing the videotape of these sessions , kubrick gave ermey the role , realizing he " was a genius for this part " .
kubrick also incorporated the 250-page transcript of ermey's rants into the script .
ermey's experience as a drill instructor during the vietnam era proved invaluable .
kubrick estimated that ermey wrote *num* % of his own dialogue , especially the insults .
while ermey practiced his lines in a rehearsal room , kubrick’s assistant leon vitali would throw tennis balls and oranges at him .
ermey had to catch the ball and throw it back as quickly as possible , while at the same time saying his lines as fast as he could .
any hesitation , slur , or missed line would necessitate starting over .
twenty error-free runs were required .
" [ he ] was my drill instructor " , ermey said of vitali .
the original casting plan envisaged anthony michael hall starring as private joker .
after eight months of negotiations , a deal between kubrick and hall fell through .
kubrick offered bruce willis a role , but the actor had to turn it down because he was to start filming of the first six episodes of his tv series " moonlighting " .
kubrick shot the film in england : in cambridgeshire , on the norfolk broads , and at the former millennium mills , beckton gas works , newham ( east london ) and the isle of dogs .
a former raf and then british army base , bassingbourn barracks doubled as the parris island marine boot camp .
a british army rifle range near barton , outside cambridge , was used in the scene where hartman congratulates private pyle for his shooting skills .
kubrick worked from still photographs of huế , taken in *num* , and found an area owned by british gas that closely resembled it and was scheduled to be demolished .
the disused beckton gas works , a few miles from central london , were filmed to represent huế after attacks .
kubrick had buildings blown up , and the film's art director used a wrecking ball to knock specific holes in certain buildings over the course of two months .
originally , kubrick had a plastic replica jungle flown in from california , but once he looked at it he was reported to have said , " i don't like it .
get rid of it " .
the open country was filmed in the cliffe marshes , and along the river thames , supplemented with *num* imported spanish palm trees and *num* , *num* plastic tropical plants from hong kong .
kubrick acquired four m41 tanks from a belgian army colonel who was an admirer of the director's work , and westland wessex helicopters painted marine green to represent marine corps sikorsky h-34 choctaw helicopters .
although the wessex was a licensed derivative of the sikorsky h-34 , the wessex substituted two gas turbine engines for the h-34's radial ( piston ) engine .
this resulted in a much longer and less rounded nose than that of the vietnam era h-34 .
kubrick also obtained a selection of rifles , m79 grenade launchers , and m60 machine guns from a licensed weapons dealer .
modine described the shoot as difficult : beckton gas works was a toxic and environmental nightmare for the entire film crew .
asbestos and hundreds of other chemicals poisoned the ground and air .
modine documents details of shooting at beckton in his book , " full metal jacket diary " ( *num* ) .
during the " boot camp " sequence of the film , modine and the other recruits had to endure the rigors of marine corps training , including having ermey yelling at them for *num* hours a day during the shooting of the parris island scenes .
to ensure the actors ' reactions to ermey were as authentic and fresh as possible , ermey and the recruits did not rehearse together .
for film continuity , each recruit had to have his head shaved once a week .
at one point during filming , ermey had a car accident , broke all of his ribs on one side , and was out for four-and-half months .
cowboy's death scene shows a building in the background that resembles the famous alien monolith in kubrick's " " ( *num* ) .
kubrick described the resemblance as an " extraordinary accident " .
during filming , hasford contemplated taking legal action over the writing credits .
originally , the filmmakers intended for hasford to receive an " additional dialogue " credit , but he fought for and eventually received full credit .
the writer took two friends and visited the set dressed as extras , only to be mistaken by a crew member for herr when hasford identified himself as the writer whose work the film was based on .
kubrick's daughter vivian—who appears uncredited as a news-camera operator at the mass grave—shadowed the filming of " full metal jacket .
" she shot *num* hours of behind-the-scenes footage for a potential " making-of " documentary similar to her earlier film documentary on kubrick's " the shining " ( *num* ) , but in this case did not make the film .
snippets of her work can be seen in the documentary " stanley kubrick's boxes " ( *num* ) .
compared to kubrick's other works , the themes of " full metal jacket " have received little attention from critics and reviewers .
michael pursell's essay " "full metal jacket " : the unravelling of patriarchy " ( *num* ) was an early , in-depth consideration of the film's two-part structure and its criticism of masculinity , arguing that the film shows " war and pornography as facets of the same system " .
most reviews have focused on military brainwashing themes in the boot camp training section of the film , while seeing the latter half of the film as more confusing and disjointed in content .
rita kempley of " the washington post " wrote , " it's as if they borrowed bits of every war movie to make this eclectic finale .
" roger ebert said , " the movie disintegrates into a series of self-contained set pieces , none of them quite satisfying .
" julian rice , in his book " kubrick's hope " ( *num* ) , sees the second part of the film as continuing the psychic journey of joker in trying to come to grips with human evil .
tony lucia , in his july *num* , *num* , review of " full metal jacket " for the " reading eagle " , looked at the themes of kubrick's career , suggesting " the unifying element may be the ordinary man dwarfed by situations too vast and imposing to handle " .
lucia specifically refers to the " military mentality " in this film .
he said further that the theme covered " a man testing himself against his own limitations " , and he concluded : " "full metal jacket " is the latest chapter in an ongoing movie which is not merely a comment on our time or a time past , but on something that reaches beyond .
" british critic gilbert adair wrote : " kubrick's approach to language has always been reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic in nature .
he appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning , only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority , by all the whims , shades and modulations of personal expression " .
michael herr wrote of his work on the screenplay : " the substance was single-minded , the old and always serious problem of how you put into a film or a book the living , behaving presence of what jung called the shadow , the most accessible of archetypes , and the easiest to experience .
.
.
war is the ultimate field of shadow-activity , where all of its other activities lead you .
as they expressed it in vietnam , ' yea , though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death , i will fear no evil , for i the evil ' .
" in a *num* review , dan schneider alleged that kubrick took the cinematic idea of a recruit being broken down in boot camp and driven to suicide from the epic film series " the human condition " ( 1959–1961 ) .
kubrick's daughter vivian kubrick , under the alias " abigail mead " , wrote the film's score .
according to an interview , which appeared in the january *num* issue of " keyboard " , the film was scored mostly with a fairlight cmi synthesizer ( the then-current series iii edition ) and a synclavier .
for the period music , kubrick went through " billboard " list of top *num* hits for each year from *num* to *num* and tried many songs , but " sometimes the dynamic range of the music was too great , and we couldn't work in dialogue " .
a single " full metal jacket ( i wanna be your drill instructor ) " , credited to mead and nigel goulding , was released to promote the film .
it incorporates ermey's drill cadences from the film .
the single reached number two in the uk pop charts .
"full metal jacket " received a limited release on june *num* , *num* , in *num* theaters .
its opening weekend saw it accrue $2 , *num* , *num* , an average of $10 , *num* per theater , ranking it the number *num* film for the june 26–28 weekend .
it took a further $2 , *num* , *num* for a total of $5 , *num* , *num* before entering wide release on july *num* , *num* , at *num* theaters—an increase of *num* .
the july 10–12 weekend saw the film gross $6 , *num* , *num* , an average of $6 , *num* per theater , and rank as the number *num* grossing film .
over the next four weeks the film opened in a further *num* theaters to its widest release of *num* , *num* theaters before closing two weeks later with a total gross of $46 , *num* , *num* , making it the number *num* highest-grossing film of *num* .
, the film had grossed $120 million worldwide , the film was released on blu-ray on october *num* , *num* , in the us and other countries .
warner home video released the *ord* anniversary edition on blu-ray on august *num* , *num* .
review aggregation website rotten tomatoes retrospectively collected reviews to give the film a score of *num* % based on reviews from *num* critics and an average rating of *num* .
*num* / *num* .
the summary states , " intense , tightly constructed , and darkly comic at times , stanley kubrick's " full metal jacket " may not boast the most original of themes , but it is exceedingly effective at communicating them .
" another aggregator metacritic gave it a score of *num* out of *num* , which indicates a " generally favorable " response , based on *num* reviews .
reviewers generally reacted favorably to the cast , ermey in particular , and the film's first act in recruit training , but several reviews were critical of the latter part of the film set in vietnam and what was considered a " muddled " moral message in the finale .
it ranks on afi's *num* years .
.
.
*num* thrills .
richard corliss of " time " called the film a " technical knockout " , praising " the dialogue's wild , desperate wit ; the daring in choosing a desultory skirmish to make a point about war's pointlessness " , and " the fine , large performances of almost every actor " , believing , at the time , that ermey and d'onofrio would receive oscar nominations .
corliss also appreciated " the olympian elegance and precision of kubrick's filmmaking " .
" empire"s ian nathan awarded the film *num* out of *num* stars , saying it is " inconsistent " and describing it as " both powerful and frustratingly unengaged " .
nathan felt that after leaving the opening act following the recruit training , the film becomes " bereft of purpose " , but he summarized his review by calling it a " hardy kubrickian effort that warms on you with repeated viewings " .
nathan also praised ermey's " staggering performance " .
vincent canby of " the new york times " called it " harrowing , beautiful and characteristically eccentric " .
canby echoed praise for ermey , calling him " the film's stunning surprise .
.
.
he's so good—so obsessed—that you might think he wrote his own lines " .
canby also said d'onofrio's performance should be admired , and he called modine " one of the best , most adaptable young film actors of his generation " .
canby concluded : " full metal jacket " was " a film of immense and very rare imagination " .
jim hall , writing for film4 in *num* , awarded the film *num* out of *num* stars and added to the praise for ermey , saying his " performance as the foul-mouthed hartman is justly celebrated and it's difficult to imagine the film working anything like as effectively without him " .
the review also preferred the opening training to the later vietnam sequence , calling it " far more striking than the second and longer section " .
film4 commented that the film ends abruptly but felt " it demonstrates just how clear and precise the director's vision could be when he resisted a fatal tendency for indulgence " .
film4 concluded : " "full metal jacket " ranks with " dr .
strangelove " as one of kubrick's very best .
" jonathan rosenbaum of the " chicago reader " called it " elliptical , full of subtle inner rhymes … and profoundly moving , this is the most tightly crafted kubrick film since " dr .
strangelove " , as well as the most horrific .
" " variety " called the film an " intense , schematic , superbly made " drama " loaded with vivid , outrageously vulgar military vernacular that contributes heavily to the film's power " , but felt that it never develops " a particularly strong narrative .
" the cast performances were all labeled " exceptional " with modine being singled out as " embodying both what it takes to survive in the war and a certain omniscience .
" gilbert adair , writing in a review for " full metal jacket " , commented that " kubrick's approach to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature .
he appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning , only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority , by all whims , shades and modulations of personal expression " .
not all reviews were positive .
" chicago sun-times " critic roger ebert held a dissenting view , calling the film " strangely shapeless " and awarding it *num* .
*num* stars out of *num* .
ebert called it " one of the best-looking war movies ever made on sets and stage " but felt this was not enough to compete with the " awesome reality of " platoon " , " apocalypse now " and " the deer hunter " .
" ebert also criticized the film's second act set in vietnam , saying the " movie disintegrates into a series of self-contained set pieces , none of them quite satisfying " and concluded that the film's message was " too little and too late " , having been done by other vietnam war films .
however , ebert also gave praise to ermey and d'onofrio , saying " these are the two best performances in the movie , which never recovers after they leave the scene .
" this review angered gene siskel on their television show " at the movies " ; he criticized ebert for liking " benji the hunted " ( which came out the same week ) more than " full metal jacket " .
their difference in opinion was parodied on the television show " the critic " , where siskel taunts ebert with " coming from the guy who liked " benji the hunted " ! " " time out london " also disliked the film saying " kubrick's direction is as steely cold and manipulative as the régime it depicts " , and felt that the characters were underdeveloped , adding " we never really get to know , let alone care about , the hapless recruits on view .
" british television channel channel *num* voted it number *num* on its list of the greatest war films ever made .
in *num* , " empire " placed " full metal jacket " number *num* on its list of " the *num* greatest movies of all time " .
"full metal jacket " was nominated for eleven awards worldwide between *num* and *num* including an academy award for best adapted screenplay , two bafta awards for best sound and best special effects , and a golden globe for best supporting actor for ermey .
ultimately it won five awards , three from organisations outside of the united states : italy , japan , and the united kingdom .
the film won best foreign language film from the japanese academy , best producer from the david di donatello awards , director of the year from the london critics circle film awards , and best director and best supporting actor from the boston society of film critics awards , for kubrick and ermey respectively .
of the five awards won , four were awarded to kubrick .
film scholar greg jenkins has done a detailed analysis of the adaptation of the novel as a screenplay .
the novel is in three parts .
the film greatly expands the relatively brief section in part i , about the boot camp on parris island , and essentially discards part iii .
this gives the film a twofold structure , telling two largely independent stories connected by the same characters acting in each .
jenkins believes this structure is a development of concepts that kubrick has had since the 1960s .
at that time , kubrick talked about wanting to explode the usual conventions of narrative structure .
sergeant hartman ( renamed from the book's gerheim ) has an expanded role in the film .
in the film , private pyle's incompetence is presented as weighing negatively on the rest of the platoon and in the film , unlike the novel , he is the only under-performing recruit .
the film omits " hartman's " disclosure to other troops that he thinks pyle might be mentally unstable , a " section *num* " .
in contrast , hartman praises pyle , saying that he is " born again hard " .
jenkins says that the character of hartman could not have been portrayed as having a warmer social relationship with the troops , as that would have upset the balance of the film , which depends on the spectacle of ordinary soldiers coming to grips with hartman as a force of nature embodying a killer culture .
various episodes in the book have been cut from the screenplay or conflated with others .
for example , cowboy's introduction of the " lusthog squad " has been both markedly shortened and supplemented by material from other sections of the book .
although the book's final , third section was largely dropped , elements from this section were inserted into other episodes of the film .
for instance , the climactic episode with the sniper is a conflation of two episodes in the book , from parts ii and iii .
jenkins thinks the film presents this passage more dramatically but in less gruesome detail than in the novel .
the film often has a more tragic tone than the book , which relies on callous humor .
joker in the film remains a model of humane thinking , as evidenced by his moral struggle in the sniper episode and elsewhere .
he works to overcome his own meekness , rather than to compete with other marines .
the film omits the book's showing his eventual domination over animal mother .
the film also omits the death of the character rafterman .
jenkins believed this allowed viewers to reflect on rafterman's personal growth in the film and speculate on his future growth after the war .
jenkins also believed rafterman's death would not have fit the plot of the screenplay .
elliptic-curve cryptography elliptic-curve cryptography ( ecc ) is an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields .
ecc requires smaller keys compared to non-ec cryptography ( based on plain galois fields ) to provide equivalent security .
elliptic curves are applicable for key agreement , digital signatures , pseudo-random generators and other tasks .
indirectly , they can be used for encryption by combining the key agreement with a symmetric encryption scheme .
they are also used in several integer factorization algorithms based on elliptic curves that have applications in cryptography , such as lenstra elliptic-curve factorization .
public-key cryptography is based on the intractability of certain mathematical problems .
early public-key systems are secure assuming that it is difficult to factor a large integer composed of two or more large prime factors .
for elliptic-curve-based protocols , it is assumed that finding the discrete logarithm of a random elliptic curve element with respect to a publicly known base point is infeasible : this is the " elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem " ( ecdlp ) .
the security of elliptic curve cryptography depends on the ability to compute a point multiplication and the inability to compute the multiplicand given the original and product points .
the size of the elliptic curve determines the difficulty of the problem .
the primary benefit promised by elliptic curve cryptography is a smaller key size , reducing storage and transmission requirements , i .
e .
that an elliptic curve group could provide the same level of security afforded by an rsa-based system with a large modulus and correspondingly larger key : for example , a 256-bit elliptic curve public key should provide comparable security to a 3072-bit rsa public key .
the u .
s .
national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) has endorsed elliptic curve cryptography in its suite b set of recommended algorithms , specifically elliptic curve diffie–hellman ( ecdh ) for key exchange and elliptic curve digital signature algorithm ( ecdsa ) for digital signature .
the u .
s .
national security agency ( nsa ) allows their use for protecting information classified up to top secret with 384-bit keys .
however , in august *num* , the nsa announced that it plans to replace suite b with a new cipher suite due to concerns about quantum computing attacks on ecc .
while the rsa patent expired in *num* , there may be patents in force covering certain aspects of ecc technology .
however some argue that the us government elliptic curve digital signature standard ( ecdsa ; nist fips 186-3 ) and certain practical ecc-based key exchange schemes ( including ecdh ) can be implemented without infringing them , including rsa laboratories and daniel j .
bernstein .
the use of elliptic curves in cryptography was suggested independently by neal koblitz and victor s .
miller in *num* .
elliptic curve cryptography algorithms entered wide use in *num* to *num* .
for current cryptographic purposes , an " elliptic curve " is a plane curve over a finite field ( rather than the real numbers ) which consists of the points satisfying the equation along with a distinguished point at infinity , denoted ∞ .
( the coordinates here are to be chosen from a fixed finite field of characteristic not equal to *num* or *num* , or the curve equation will be somewhat more complicated .
) this set together with the group operation of elliptic curves is an abelian group , with the point at infinity as identity element .
the structure of the group is inherited from the divisor group of the underlying algebraic variety .
several discrete logarithm-based protocols have been adapted to elliptic curves , replacing the group formula_3 with an elliptic curve : at the rsa conference *num* , the national security agency ( nsa ) announced suite b which exclusively uses ecc for digital signature generation and key exchange .
the suite is intended to protect both classified and unclassified national security systems and information .
recently , a large number of cryptographic primitives based on bilinear mappings on various elliptic curve groups , such as the weil and tate pairings , have been introduced .
schemes based on these primitives provide efficient identity-based encryption as well as pairing-based signatures , signcryption , key agreement , and proxy re-encryption .
some common implementation considerations include : to use ecc , all parties must agree on all the elements defining the elliptic curve , that is , the " domain parameters " of the scheme .
the field is defined by " p " in the prime case and the pair of " m " and " f " in the binary case .
the elliptic curve is defined by the constants " a " and " b " used in its defining equation .
finally , the cyclic subgroup is defined by its " generator " ( a .
k .
a .
" base point " ) " g " .
for cryptographic application the order of " g " , that is the smallest positive number " n " such that formula_4 ( the point at infinity of the curve , and the identity element ) , is normally prime .
since " n " is the size of a subgroup of formula_5 it follows from lagrange's theorem that the number formula_6 is an integer .
in cryptographic applications this number " h " , called the " cofactor " , must be small ( formula_7 ) and , preferably , formula_8 .
to summarize : in the prime case , the domain parameters are formula_9 ; in the binary case , they are formula_10 .
unless there is an assurance that domain parameters were generated by a party trusted with respect to their use , the domain parameters " must " be validated before use .
the generation of domain parameters is not usually done by each participant because this involves computing the number of points on a curve which is time-consuming and troublesome to implement .
as a result , several standard bodies published domain parameters of elliptic curves for several common field sizes .
such domain parameters are commonly known as " standard curves " or " named curves " ; a named curve can be referenced either by name or by the unique object identifier defined in the standard documents : secg test vectors are also available .
nist has approved many secg curves , so there is a significant overlap between the specifications published by nist and secg .
ec domain parameters may be either specified by value or by name .
if one ( despite the above ) wants to construct one's own domain parameters , one should select the underlying field and then use one of the following strategies to find a curve with appropriate ( i .
e .
, near prime ) number of points using one of the following methods : several classes of curves are weak and should be avoided : because all the fastest known algorithms that allow one to solve the ecdlp ( baby-step giant-step , pollard's rho , etc .
) , need formula_19 steps , it follows that the size of the underlying field should be roughly twice the security parameter .
for example , for 128-bit security one needs a curve over formula_18 , where formula_21 .
this can be contrasted with finite-field cryptography ( e .
g .
, dsa ) which requires 3072-bit public keys and 256-bit private keys , and integer factorization cryptography ( e .
g .
, rsa ) which requires a 3072-bit value of " n " , where the private key should be just as large .
however the public key may be smaller to accommodate efficient encryption , especially when processing power is limited .
the hardest ecc scheme ( publicly ) broken to date had a 112-bit key for the prime field case and a 109-bit key for the binary field case .
for the prime field case , this was broken in july *num* using a cluster of over *num* playstation *num* game consoles and could have been finished in *num* .
*num* months using this cluster when running continuously .
the binary field case was broken in april *num* using *num* computers over *num* months .
a current project is aiming at breaking the ecc2k-130 challenge by certicom , by using a wide range of different hardware : cpus , gpus , fpga .
a close examination of the addition rules shows that in order to add two points , one needs not only several additions and multiplications in formula_18 but also an inversion operation .
the inversion ( for given formula_23 find formula_24 such that formula_25 ) is one to two orders of magnitude slower than multiplication .
however , points on a curve can be represented in different coordinate systems which do not require an inversion operation to add two points .
several such systems were proposed : in the " projective " system each point is represented by three coordinates formula_26 using the following relation : formula_27 , formula_28 ; in the " jacobian system " a point is also represented with three coordinates formula_26 , but a different relation is used : formula_30 , formula_31 ; in the " lópez–dahab system " the relation is formula_27 , formula_33 ; in the " modified jacobian " system the same relations are used but four coordinates are stored and used for calculations formula_34 ; and in the " chudnovsky jacobian " system five coordinates are used formula_35 .
note that there may be different naming conventions , for example , ieee p1363-2000 standard uses " projective coordinates " to refer to what is commonly called jacobian coordinates .
an additional speed-up is possible if mixed coordinates are used .
reduction modulo " p " ( which is needed for addition and multiplication ) can be executed much faster if the prime " p " is a pseudo-mersenne prime , that is formula_36 ; for example , formula_37 or formula_38 compared to barrett reduction , there can be an order of magnitude speed-up .
the speed-up here is a practical rather than theoretical one , and derives from the fact that the moduli of numbers against numbers near powers of two can be performed efficiently by computers operating on binary numbers with bitwise operations .
the curves over formula_14 with pseudo-mersenne " p " are recommended by nist .
yet another advantage of the nist curves is that they use " a" = −3 , which improves addition in jacobian coordinates .
according to bernstein and lange , many of the efficiency-related decisions in nist fips 186-2 are sub-optimal .
other curves are more secure and run just as fast .
elliptic curves are applicable for encryption , digital signatures , pseudo-random generators and other tasks .
they are also used in several integer factorization algorithms that have applications in cryptography , such as lenstra elliptic curve factorization .
in *num* , nist recommended *num* elliptic curves .
specifically , fips 186-3 has *num* recommended finite fields : the nist recommendation thus contains a total of *num* prime curves and *num* binary curves .
the curves were ostensibly chosen for optimal security and implementation efficiency .
in *num* , " the new york times " stated that dual elliptic curve deterministic random bit generation ( or dual_ec_drbg ) had been included as a nist national standard due to the influence of nsa , which had included a deliberate weakness in the algorithm and the recommended elliptic curve .
rsa security in september *num* issued an advisory recommending that its customers discontinue using any software based on dual_ec_drbg .
in the wake of the exposure of dual_ec_drbg as " an nsa undercover operation " , cryptography experts have also expressed concern over the security of the nist recommended elliptic curves , suggesting a return to encryption based on non-elliptic-curve groups .
elliptic curve cryptography is used by the cryptocurrency bitcoin .
unlike most other dlp systems ( where it is possible to use the same procedure for squaring and multiplication ) , the ec addition is significantly different for doubling ( " p " = " q " ) and general addition ( " p " ≠ " q " ) depending on the coordinate system used .
consequently , it is important to counteract side channel attacks ( e .
g .
, timing or simple / differential power analysis attacks ) using , for example , fixed pattern window ( a .
k .
a .
comb ) methods ( note that this does not increase computation time ) .
alternatively one can use an edwards curve ; this is a special family of elliptic curves for which doubling and addition can be done with the same operation .
another concern for ecc-systems is the danger of fault attacks , especially when running on smart cards .
cryptographic experts have expressed concerns that the national security agency has inserted a kleptographic backdoor into at least one elliptic curve-based pseudo random generator .
internal memos leaked by former nsa contractor , edward snowden , suggest that the nsa put a backdoor in the dual ec drbg standard .
one analysis of the possible backdoor concluded that an adversary in possession of the algorithm's secret key could obtain encryption keys given only *num* bytes of prng output .
the safecurves project has been launched in order to catalog curves that are easy to securely implement and are designed in a fully publicly verifiable way to minimize the chance of a backdoor .
shor's algorithm can be used to break elliptic curve cryptography by computing discrete logarithms on a hypothetical quantum computer .
the latest quantum resource estimates for breaking a curve with a 256-bit modulus ( 128-bit security level ) are *num* qubits and *num* billion toffoli gates .
in comparison , using shor's algorithm to break the rsa algorithm requires *num* qubits and *num* .
*num* trillion toffoli gates for a 2048-bit rsa key , suggesting that ecc is an easier target for quantum computers than rsa .
all of these figures vastly exceed any quantum computer that has ever been built , and estimates place the creation of such computers as a decade or more away .
supersingular isogeny diffie–hellman key exchange provides a post-quantum secure form of elliptic curve cryptography by using isogenies to implement diffie–hellman key exchanges .
this key exchange uses much of the same field arithmetic as existing elliptic curve cryptography and requires computational and transmission overhead similar to many currently used public key systems .
in august *num* , nsa announced that it planned to transition " in the not distant future " to a new cipher suite that is resistant to quantum attacks .
" unfortunately , the growth of elliptic curve use has bumped up against the fact of continued progress in the research on quantum computing , necessitating a re-evaluation of our cryptographic strategy .
" at least one ecc scheme ( ecmqv ) and some implementation techniques are covered by patents .
deng xiaoping deng xiaoping ( ; ; courtesy name xixian ; *num* august *num* – *num* february *num* ) was a chinese politician who was the paramount leader of the people's republic of china from *num* until his retirement in *num* .
after chairman mao zedong's death in *num* , deng led china through far-reaching market-economy reforms .
born into a peasant background in guang'an , sichuan province , deng studied and worked in france in the 1920s , where he became a follower of marxism–leninism .
he joined the communist party of china in *num* .
upon his return to china , he joined the party organization in shanghai , then was a political commissar for the red army in rural regions and by the late 1930s was considered a " revolutionary veteran " because he participated in the long march .
following the founding of the people's republic in *num* , deng worked in tibet and the southwest region to consolidate communist control .
as the party's secretary general in the 1950s , deng presided over anti-rightist campaigns and became instrumental in china's economic reconstruction following the great leap forward of 1957–1960 .
however , his economic policies caused him to fall out of favor with mao zedong and was purged twice during the cultural revolution .
following mao zedong's death in *num* , deng outmanoeuvred the late chairman's chosen successor hua guofeng in december *num* .
inheriting a country beset with social conflict , disenchantment with the communist party and institutional disorder resulting from the chaotic policies of the mao era , deng became the paramount figure of the " second generation " of party leadership .
while deng never held office as the head of state , head of government or general secretary ( leader of the communist party ) , some called him " the architect " of a new brand of thinking that combined socialist ideology with free enterprise whose slogan was " socialism with chinese characteristics " .
deng opened china to foreign investment and the global market , policies that are credited with developing china into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world for several generations and raising the standard of living of hundreds of millions .
deng was the " time " person of the year in *num* and *num* , the third chinese leader ( after chiang kai-shek and his wife soong mei-ling ) and the fourth communist leader ( after joseph stalin , picked twice ; and nikita khrushchev ) to be selected .
he was criticized for ordering the crackdown on the tiananmen square protests of *num* , but praised for his reaffirmation of the reform program in his southern tour of *num* and the reversion of hong kong to chinese control in *num* .
deng died in february *num* , aged *num* .
deng possibly has ancestry from ethnically hakka han family in the village of paifang ( ) , in the town of , guang'an county in sichuan province , approximately from chongqing ( formerly spelled " chungking " ) .
deng's ancestors can be traced back to jiaying county ( now renamed to meixian ) , guangdong , a prominent ancestral area for the hakka people , and had been settled in sichuan for several generations .
deng xiaoping's daughter deng rong wrote in the book " my father deng xiaoping " ( ) that his ancestry was probably but not definitely hakka .
sichuan was originally the origin of the deng lineage until one of them was hired as an official in guangdong during the ming dynasty but during the qing plan to increase the population in *num* they came to sichuan again .
deng xiaoping was born in sichuan .
deng's father , deng wenming , was a middle-level landowner and had studied at the university of law and political science in chengdu .
his mother , surnamed dan , died early in deng's life , leaving deng , his three brothers and three sisters .
at the age of five deng was sent to a traditional chinese-style private primary school , followed by a more modern primary school at the age of seven .
deng's first wife , one of his schoolmates from moscow , died aged *num* a few days after giving birth to deng's first child , a baby girl who also died .
his second wife , jin weiying , left him after deng came under political attack in *num* .
his third wife zhuo lin was the daughter of an industrialist in yunnan province .
she became a member of the communist party in *num* , and married deng a year later in front of mao's cave dwelling in yan'an .
they had five children : three daughters ( deng lin , deng nan and deng rong ) and two sons ( deng pufang and deng zhifang ) .
when deng first attended school , his tutor objected to his having the given name " xiānshèng " ( ) , calling him " xīxián " ( ) , which includes the characters " to aspire to " and " goodness " , with overtones of wisdom .
in the summer of *num* , deng xiaoping graduated from the chongqing school .
he and *num* schoolmates travelled by ship to france ( travelling steerage ) to participate in the diligent work-frugal study movement , a work-study program in which *num* , *num* chinese would participate by *num* .
deng , the youngest of all the chinese students in the group , had just turned *num* .
wu yuzhang , the local leader of the movement in chongqing , enrolled deng and his paternal uncle , deng shaosheng , in the program .
deng's father strongly supported his son's participation in the work-study abroad program .
the night before his departure , deng's father took his son aside and asked him what he hoped to learn in france .
he repeated the words he had learned from his teachers : " to learn knowledge and truth from the west in order to save china .
" deng was aware that china was suffering greatly , and that the chinese people must have a modern education to save their country .
in december *num* a french packet ship , the " andré lyon " , sailed into marseille with *num* chinese students aboard including deng .
the sixteen-year-old deng briefly attended middle schools in bayeux and châtillon , but he spent most of his time in france working .
his first job was as a fitter at the le creusot iron and steel plant in la garenne-colombes , a south-western suburb of paris where he moved in april *num* .
coincidentally , when deng xiaoping's later political fortunes were down and he was sent to work in a tractor factory in *num* he found himself a fitter again and proved to still be a master of the skill .
in la garenne-colombes deng met zhou enlai , nie rongzhen , cai hesen , zhao shiyan and li wenhai .
under the influence of these older chinese students in france , deng began to study marxism and engaged in political dissemination work .
in *num* he joined the chinese communist youth league in europe .
in the second half of *num* , he joined the chinese communist party and became one of the leading members of the general branch of the youth league in europe .
in *num* deng traveled to the soviet union and studied at moscow sun yat-sen university , where one of his classmates was chiang ching-kuo , the son of chiang kai-shek .
in late *num* , deng left moscow to return to china , where he joined the army of feng yuxiang , a military leader in northwest china , who had requested assistance from the soviet union in his struggle with other local leaders in the region .
at that time , the soviet union , through the comintern , an international organization supporting the communist movements , supported the communists ' alliance with the nationalists of the kuomintang ( kmt ) party founded by sun yat-sen .
he arrived in xi'an , the stronghold of feng yuxiang , in march *num* .
he was part of the fengtian clique's attempt to prevent the break of the alliance between the kmt and the communists .
this split resulted in part from chiang kai-shek's forcing them to flee areas controlled by the kmt .
after the breakup of the alliance between communists and nationalists , feng yuxiang stood on the side of chiang kai-shek , and the communists who participated in their army , such as deng xiaoping , were forced to flee .
in *num* deng led the baise uprising in guangxi province against the kuomintang ( kmt ) government .
the uprising failed and deng went to the central soviet area in jiangxi province .
although deng got involved in the marxist revolutionary movement in china , the historian mobo gao has argued that " deng xiaoping and many like him [ in the chinese communist party ] were not really marxists , but basically revolutionary nationalists who wanted to see china standing on equal terms with the great global powers .
they were primarily nationalists and they participated in the communist revolution because that was the only viable route they could find chinese nationalism .
" after leaving the army of feng yuxiang in the northwest , deng ended up in the city of wuhan , where the communists at that time had their headquarters .
at that time , he began using the nickname " xiaoping " and occupied prominent positions in the party apparatus .
he participated in the historic emergency session on *num* august *num* in which , by soviet instruction , the party dismissed its founder chen duxiu , and qu qiubai became the secretary general .
in wuhan , deng first established contact with mao zedong , who was then little valued by militant pro-soviet leaders of the party .
between *num* and *num* , deng lived in shanghai , where he helped organize protests that would be harshly persecuted by the kuomintang authorities .
the death of many communist militants in those years led to a decrease in the number of members of the communist party , which enabled deng to quickly move up the ranks .
during this stage in shanghai , deng married a woman he met in moscow , zhang xiyuan .
beginning in *num* , he participated in the struggle against the kuomintang in guangxi .
the superiority of the forces of chiang kai-shek caused a huge number of casualties in the communist ranks .
the confrontational strategy of the party leadership was a failure that killed many militants .
the response to this defeat catalyzed one of the most confusing episodes in the biography of deng : in march *num* , he left the communist army seventh battalion to appear sometime later in shanghai .
his official biography states that deng had been charged by his superiors with deserting from the battle zone before fleeing to shanghai , where there were leaders of the underground communist party .
although he was not punished in shanghai , this episode in his biography remains unclear and would be used against him to question his devotion to the communist party during the cultural revolution era .
after returning to shanghai , deng discovered that his wife and daughter had died during childbirth .
in addition , he discovered that many of his former comrades had died as a result of the kuomintang's crackdown against the communists .
the campaigns against the communists in the cities represented a setback for the party and in particular to the comintern soviet advisers , who saw the mobilization of the urban proletariat as the force for the advancement of communism .
contrary to the urban vision of the revolution , based on the soviet experience , the communist leader mao zedong saw the rural peasants as the revolutionary force in china .
in a mountainous area of jiangxi province , where mao went to establish a communist system , there developed the embryo of a future state of china under communism , which adopted the official name of the chinese soviet republic , but was better known as the " jiangxi soviet " .
in one of the most important cities in the soviet zone , ruijin , deng took over as secretary of the party committee in the summer of *num* .
in the winter of *num* , deng went on to play the same position in the nearby district of huichang .
in *num* he became director of the propaganda department of the provincial party committee in jiangxi .
it was then that he married a young woman he had met in shanghai named jin weiying .
the successes of the soviet in jiangxi made the party leaders decide to move to jiangxi from shanghai .
the confrontation among mao , the party leaders , and their soviet advisers was increasingly tense and the struggle for power between the two factions led to the removal of deng , who favored the ideas of mao , from his position in the propaganda department .
despite the strife within the party , the jiangxi soviet became the first successful experiment of communist rule in rural china .
it even issued stamps and paper money under the letterhead of the soviet republic of china , and the army of chiang kai-shek finally decided to attack the communist area .
surrounded by the more powerful army of the republic of china , the communists fled jiangxi in october *num* .
thus began the epic movement that would mark a turning point in the development of chinese communism .
the evacuation was difficult because the army of the republic had taken positions in all areas occupied by the communists .
advancing through remote and mountainous terrain , some *num* , *num* men managed to escape jiangxi , starting a long strategic retreat through the interior of china , which ended one year later when between *num* , *num* and *num* , *num* survivors reached the northern province of shaanxi .
during the zunyi conference at the beginning of the long march , the so-called *num* bolsheviks , led by bo gu and wang ming , were ousted from power and mao zedong , to the dismay of the soviet union , had become the new leader of the communist party of china .
the pro-soviet communist party of china had ended and a new rural-inspired party emerged under the leadership of mao .
deng had once again become a leading figure in the party when the north ended up winning the civil war against the kuomintang .
the confrontation between the two parties was temporarily interrupted , however , by the japanese invasion , forcing the kuomintang to form an alliance for the second time with the communists to defend the nation against external aggression .
the invasion of japanese troops in *num* marked the beginning of the second sino-japanese war .
during the invasion , deng remained in the area controlled by the communists in the north , where he assumed the role of deputy political director of the three divisions of the restructured communist army .
from september *num* until january *num* , he lived in buddhist monasteries and temples in the wutai mountains .
in january *num* , he was appointed as political commissar of the *ord* division of the eighth route army commanded by liu bocheng , starting a long-lasting partnership with liu .
deng stayed for most of the conflict with the japanese in the war front in the area bordering the provinces of shanxi , henan and hebei , then traveled several times to the city of yan'an , where mao had established the basis for communist party leadership .
in one of his trips to yan'an in *num* , he married , for the third and last time in his life , zhuo lin , a young native of kunming , who , like other young idealists of the time , had traveled to yan'an to join the communists .
deng took a leading role in the hundred regiments offensive which boosted his standing among his comrades .
after japan's defeat in world war ii , deng traveled to chongqing , the city in which chiang kai-shek established his government during the japanese invasion , to participate in peace talks between the kuomintang and the communist party .
the results of those negotiations were not positive and military confrontation between the two antagonistic parties resumed shortly after the meeting in chongqing .
while chiang kai-shek re-established the government in nanjing , the capital of the republic of china , the communists were fighting for control in the field .
following up with guerrilla tactics from their positions in rural areas against cities under the control of the government of chiang and their supply lines , the communists were increasing the territory under their control , and incorporating more and more soldiers who had deserted the nationalist army .
deng played a major part in the huaihai campaign against the nationalists .
in the final phase of the war , deng again exercised a key role as political leader and propaganda master as political commissar of the *ord* field army commanded by liu bocheng .
he also participated in disseminating the ideas of mao zedong , which turned into the ideological foundation of the communist party .
his political and ideological work , along with his status as a veteran of the long march , placed him in a privileged position within the party to occupy positions of power after the communist party managed to defeat chiang kai-shek and founded the people's republic of china .
on *num* october *num* , deng attended the proclamation of the people's republic of china in beijing .
at that time , the communist party controlled the entire north , but there were still parts of the south held by the kuomintang regime .
he became responsible for leading the annexation of southwest china , in his capacity as the first secretary of the department of the southwest .
this organization had the task of managing the final takeover of that part of the country still held by the kuomintang ; tibet remained independent for another year .
the kuomintang government was being forced to leave guangzhou , and established chongqing as a new provisional capital .
there , chiang kai-shek and his son chiang ching-kuo , a former classmate of deng in moscow , wanted to stop the advance of the communist party forces .
under the political control of deng , the communist army took over chongqing in late november *num* and entered chengdu , the last bastion of power of chiang kai-shek , a few days later .
at that time deng became mayor of chongqing , while he simultaneously was the leader of the communist party in the southwest , where the communist army , now proclaiming itself the people's liberation army , suppressed resistance loyal to the old kuomintang regime .
in *num* , the communist party-ruled state also seized control over tibet .
deng xiaoping would spend three years in chongqing , the city where he had studied in his teenage years before going to france .
in *num* he moved to beijing , where he occupied different positions in the central government .
in july *num* , deng came to beijing to assume the posts of vice premier and deputy chair of the committee on finance .
soon after , he took the posts of minister of finance and director of the office of communications .
in *num* , he was removed from all these positions , holding only the post of deputy premier .
in *num* , he became head of the communist party's organization department and member of the central military commission .
after officially supporting mao zedong in his anti-rightist movement of *num* , deng acted as secretary general of the secretariat and ran the country's daily affairs with president liu shaoqi and premier zhou enlai .
deng and liu's policies emphasized economics over ideological dogma , an implicit departure from the mass hysteria of the great leap forward .
both liu and deng supported mao in the mass campaigns of the 1950s , in which they attacked the bourgeois and capitalists , and promoted mao's ideology .
however , the economic failure of the great leap forward was seen as an indictment on the ability of mao to manage the economy .
peng dehuai openly criticized mao , while liu shaoqi and deng , though more cautious , began to take charge of economic policy , leaving mao out of day-to-day affairs of the party and state .
mao agreed to cede the presidency of the people's republic of china ( china's " de jure " head of state position ) to liu shaoqi , while retaining his positions as leader of the party and the army .
at the *ord* national congress of the communist party of china in *num* , deng supported removing all references to " mao zedong thought " from the party statutes .
in *num* , deng traveled to moscow to lead a meeting of the chinese delegation with stalin's successor , nikita khrushchev .
relations between the people's republic of china and the soviet union had worsened since the death of stalin .
after this meeting , no agreement was reached and the sino–soviet split was consummated ; there was an almost total suspension of relations between the two major communist powers of the time .
liu and deng's economic reforms of the early 1960s were generally popular and restored many of the economic institutions previously dismantled during the great leap forward .
mao , sensing his loss of prestige , took action to regain control of the state .
appealing to his revolutionary spirit , mao launched the cultural revolution , which encouraged the masses to root out the right-wing capitalists who have " infiltrated the party " .
deng was labelled the second-in-command of the capitalist roader faction .
mao feared that the reformist economic policies of deng and liu could lead to restoration of capitalism and end the chinese revolution .
for this and other reasons , mao launched the cultural revolution in *num* , during which deng fell out of favor and was forced to retire from all his positions .
during the cultural revolution , he and his family were targeted by red guards , who imprisoned deng's eldest son , deng pufang .
deng pufang was tortured and jumped out , or was thrown out , of the window of a four-story building in *num* , becoming a paraplegic .
in october *num* deng xiaoping was sent to the xinjian county tractor factory in rural jiangxi province to work as a regular worker .
in his four years there , deng spent his spare time writing .
he was purged nationally , but to a lesser scale than president liu shaoqi .
after lin biao was killed in an air crash ( according to official reports he was trying to flee from china after unsuccessfully trying to stage a coup against mao ) , deng xiaoping ( who had been political commissar of the *ord* field army during the civil war ) became the most influential of the remaining army leaders .
when premier zhou enlai fell ill with cancer , deng became zhou's choice as successor , and zhou was able to convince mao to bring deng back into politics in *num* as first vice-premier , in practice running daily affairs .
deng focused on reconstructing the country's economy and stressed unity as the first step by raising production .
he remained careful , however , to avoid contradicting maoist ideology on paper .
during his brief ascendency , deng established the political research office , headed by intellectuals hu qiaomu , yu guangyuan and hu sheng , delegated to explore approaches to political and economic reforms .
he led the group himself and managed the project within the state council , in order to avoid rousing the suspicions of the gang of four .
the cultural revolution was not yet over , and a radical leftist political group known as the gang of four , led by mao's wife jiang qing , competed for power within the party .
the gang saw deng as their greatest challenge to power .
mao , too , was suspicious that deng would destroy the positive reputation of the cultural revolution , which mao considered one of his greatest policy initiatives .
beginning in late *num* , deng was asked to draw up a series of self-criticisms .
although he admitted to having taken an " inappropriate ideological perspective " while dealing with state and party affairs , he was reluctant to admit that his policies were wrong in essence .
his antagonism with the gang of four became increasingly clear , and mao seemed to sway in the gang's favour .
mao refused to accept deng's self-criticisms and asked the party's central committee to " discuss deng's mistakes thoroughly " .
zhou enlai died in january *num* , to an outpouring of national grief .
zhou was a very important figure in deng's political life , and his death eroded his remaining support within the party's central committee .
after deng delivered zhou's official eulogy at the state funeral , the gang of four , with mao's permission , began the so-called " criticize deng and oppose the rehabilitation of right-leaning elements " campaign .
hua guofeng , not deng , was selected to become zhou's successor .
on *num* february *num* , the central committee issued a top-priority directive , officially transferring deng to work on " external affairs " and thus removing deng from the party's power apparatus .
deng stayed at home for several months , awaiting his fate .
the political research office was promptly dissolved , and deng's advisers such as yu guangyuan suspended .
as a result , the political turmoil halted the economic progress deng had laboured for in the past year .
on *num* march , mao issued a directive reaffirming the legitimacy of the cultural revolution and specifically pointed to deng as an internal , rather than external , problem .
this was followed by a central committee directive issued to all local party organs to study mao's directive and criticize deng .
deng's reputation as a reformer suffered a severe blow when the qingming festival , after the mass public mourning of zhou on a traditional chinese holiday , culminated in the tiananmen incident of *num* , an event the gang of four branded as counter-revolutionary and threatening to their power .
furthermore , the gang deemed deng the mastermind behind the incident , and mao himself wrote that " the nature of things has changed " .
this prompted mao to remove deng from all leadership positions , although he retained his party membership .
following mao's death on *num* september *num* and the purge of the gang of four in october *num* , deng gradually emerged as the " de facto " leader of china .
prior to mao's death , the only governmental position he held was that of first vice premier of the state council , but hua guofeng wanted to rid the party of extremists and successfully marginalised the gang of four .
on *num* july *num* , deng was restored to the posts of vice-chairman of the central committee , vice-chairman of the military commission and chief of the general staff of the people's liberation army .
by carefully mobilizing his supporters within the party , deng outmaneuvered hua , who had pardoned him , then ousted hua from his top leadership positions by *num* .
in contrast to previous leadership changes , deng allowed hua to retain membership in the central committee and quietly retire , helping to set the precedent that losing a high-level leadership struggle would not result in physical harm .
deng repudiated the cultural revolution and , in *num* , launched the " beijing spring " , which allowed open criticism of the excesses and suffering that had occurred during the period .
meanwhile , he was the impetus for the abolition of the class background system .
under this system , the cpc removed employment barriers to chinese deemed to be associated with the former landlord class ; its removal allowed a faction favoring the restoration of the private market to enter the communist party .
deng gradually outmaneuvered his political opponents .
by encouraging public criticism of the cultural revolution , he weakened the position of those who owed their political positions to that event , while strengthening the position of those like himself who had been purged during that time .
deng also received a great deal of popular support .
as deng gradually consolidated control over the cpc , hua was replaced by zhao ziyang as premier in *num* , and by hu yaobang as party chief in *num* , despite the fact that hua was mao zedong's designated successor as the " paramount leader " of the communist party of china and the people's republic of china .
important decisions were always taken in deng's home in zhongnanhai with a caucus of eight senior party cadres , called " eight elders " , especially with chen yun and li xiannian .
deng ruled as " paramount leader " although he never held the top title of the party , and was able to successively remove three party leaders , including hu yaobang .
deng remained the most influential of the cpc cadre , although after *num* his only official posts were as chairman of the state and communist party central military commissions .
deng's elevation to china's new number-one figure meant that the historical and ideological questions around mao zedong had to be addressed properly .
because deng wished to pursue deep reforms , it was not possible for him to continue mao's hard-line " class struggle " policies and mass public campaigns .
in *num* the central committee of the communist party released a document entitled " on the various historical issues since the founding of the people's republic of china " .
mao retained his status as a " great marxist , proletarian revolutionary , militarist , and general " , and the undisputed founder and pioneer of the country and the people's liberation army .
" his accomplishments must be considered before his mistakes " , the document declared .
deng personally commented that mao was " seven parts good , three parts bad .
" the document also steered the prime responsibility of the cultural revolution away from mao ( although it did state that " mao mistakenly began the cultural revolution " ) to the " counter-revolutionary cliques " of the gang of four and lin biao .
during his paramount leadership , his official state positions were chairman of the national committee of the chinese people's political consultative conference from 1978–1983 and chairman of the central military commission of the people's republic of china from 1983–1990 , while his official party positions were vice chairman of the communist party of china from 1977–1982 and chairman of the central military commission of the communist party of china from 1981–1989 .
in november *num* , after the country had stabilized following political turmoil , deng visited bangkok , kuala lumpur and singapore and met with singapore's prime minister lee kuan yew .
deng was very impressed with singapore's economic development , greenery and housing , and later sent tens of thousands of chinese to singapore and countries around the world to learn from their experiences and bring back their knowledge .
lee , on the other hand , advised deng to stop exporting communist ideologies to southeast asia , advice that deng later followed .
thanks to the support of other party leaders who had already recovered their official positions , in *num* the rise to power of deng was inevitable .
even though hua guofeng formally monopolized the top positions in the people's republic , his position , with little support , was becoming increasingly difficult .
in december *num* , during the third plenum of the *ord* central committee congress of the communist party of china , deng took over the reins of power .
beginning in *num* , the economic reforms accelerated the market model , while the leaders maintained old communist-style rhetoric .
the commune system was gradually dismantled and the peasants began to have more freedom to manage the land they cultivated and sell their products on the market .
at the same time , china's economy opened up to foreign trade .
on january *num* , *num* , the united states recognized the people's republic of china , leaving the ( taiwan ) republic of china's nationalist government to one side , and business contacts between china and the west began to grow .
in late *num* , the aerospace company boeing announced the sale of *num* aircraft to various airlines in the prc , and the beverage company coca-cola made public their intention to open a production plant in shanghai .
in early *num* , deng undertook an official visit to the united states , meeting president jimmy carter in washington as well as several congressmen .
the chinese insisted that former president richard nixon be invited to the formal white house reception , a symbolic indication of their assertiveness on the one hand , and their desire to continue with the nixon initiatives on the other .
during the visit , deng visited the johnson space center in houston , as well as the headquarters of coca-cola and boeing in atlanta and seattle , respectively .
with these visits so significant , deng made it clear that the new chinese regime's priorities were economic and technological development .
sino-japanese relations also improved significantly .
deng used japan as an example of a rapidly progressing power that set a good example for china economically .
true to his famous july *num* pronouncement at the communist youth league conference , " it doesn't matter whether a cat is black or white , if it catches mice it is a good cat " , which had caused so much criticism , deng , along with his closest collaborators , such as zhao ziyang , who in *num* relieved hua guofeng as premier , and hu yaobang , who in *num* did the same with the post of party chairman , took the reins of power and the purpose of advancing the " four modernizations " ( economy , agriculture , scientific and technological development and national defense ) , and announced an ambitious plan of opening and liberalizing the economy .
the last position of power retained by hua guofeng , chairman of the central military commission , was taken by deng in *num* .
from *num* onwards , deng led the expansion of the economy , and in political terms took over negotiations with the united kingdom to return the territory of hong kong , meeting personally with then-prime minister margaret thatcher .
the result of these negotiations was the sino-british joint declaration , signed on *num* december *num* , which formally outlined the united kingdom's return of hong kong to china by *num* .
the chinese government pledged to respect the economic system and civil liberties of the british colony for fifty years after the handover .
under pressure from chinese authorities , portugal agreed in *num* to arrange the return of macau by *num* , with an agreement roughly equal to that of hong kong .
the return of these two territories was based on a political principle formulated by deng himself called " one country , two systems " , which refers to the co-existence under one political authority of areas with different economic systems of communism and capitalism .
although this theory was applied to hong kong and macau , deng apparently intended to also present it as an attractive option to the people of taiwan for eventual incorporation of that island , where sovereignty over the territory is still disputed .
china's rapid economic growth presented several problems .
the *num* census revealed the extraordinary growth of the population , which already exceeded a billion people .
deng continued the plans initiated by hua guofeng to restrict birth to only one child , limiting women to one child under pain of administrative penalty .
around this time , deng launched his first " strike hard " anti-crime campaign in august *num* .
it was reported that the government set quotas for *num* , *num* executions by mid-november , and sources in taiwan claimed that as many as *num* , *num* people were executed in that time , although more recent estimates have placed the number at *num* , *num* executed by firing squad within the first year of the campaign .
yet increasing economic freedom was being translated into a greater freedom of opinion , and critics began to arise within the system , including the famous dissident wei jingsheng , who coined the term " fifth modernization " in reference to democracy as a missing element in the renewal plans of deng xiaoping .
in the late 1980s , dissatisfaction with the authoritarian regime and growing inequalities caused the biggest crisis to deng's leadership .
in october *num* , at the plenary session of the national people's congress , deng was re-elected as chairman of the central military commission , but he resigned as chairman of the central advisory commission and was succeeded by chen yun .
deng continued to chair and develop the reform and opening up as the main policy , and he advanced the three steps suitable for china's economic development strategy within seventy years : the first step , to double the *num* gnp and ensure that the people have enough food and clothing , was attained by the end of the 1980s ; the second step , to quadruple the *num* gnp by the end of the *ord* century , was achieved in *num* ahead of schedule ; the third step , to increase per capita gnp to the level of the medium-developed countries by *num* , at which point , the chinese people will be fairly well-off and modernization will be basically realized .
deng did little to improve relations with the soviet union .
he continued to adhere to the maoist line of the sino–soviet split era that the soviet union was a superpower as " hegemonic " as the united states , but even more threatening to china because of its close proximity .
improving relations with the outside world was the second of two important philosophical shifts outlined in deng's program of reform termed " gaige kaifang " ( " lit .
" reforms and openness ) .
china's domestic social , political , and most notably , economic systems would undergo significant changes during deng's time .
the goals of deng's reforms were summed up by the four modernizations , those of agriculture , industry , science and technology , and the military .
the strategy for achieving these aims of becoming a modern , industrial nation was the socialist market economy .
deng argued that china was in the primary stage of socialism and that the duty of the party was to perfect so-called " socialism with chinese characteristics " , and " seek truth from facts " .
( this somewhat resembles the leninist theoretical justification of the new economic policy ( nep ) in the 1920s , which argued that the soviet union had not gone deeply enough into the capitalist phase and therefore needed limited capitalism in order to fully evolve its means of production .
) this interpretation of maoism reduced the role of ideology in economic decision-making .
downgrading communitarian values , but not necessarily criticising the ideology of marxism-leninism , deng emphasized that " socialism does not mean shared poverty " .
his theoretical justification for allowing market forces was given as such : unlike hua guofeng , deng believed that no policy should be rejected outright simply because it was not associated with mao .
unlike more conservative leaders such as chen yun , deng did not object to policies on the grounds that they were similar to ones that were found in capitalist nations .
this political flexibility towards the foundations of socialism is strongly supported by quotes such as : although deng provided the theoretical background and the political support to allow economic reform to occur , the general consensus amongst historians is that few of the economic reforms that deng introduced were originated by deng himself .
premier zhou enlai , for example , pioneered the four modernizations years before deng .
in addition , many reforms would be introduced by local leaders , often not sanctioned by central government directives .
if successful and promising , these reforms would be adopted by larger and larger areas and ultimately introduced nationally .
an often cited example is the household responsibility system , which was first secretly implemented by a poor rural village at the risk of being convicted as " counter-revolutionary .
" this experiment proved very successful .
deng openly supported it and it was later adopted nationally .
many other reforms were influenced by the experiences of the east asian tigers .
this is in sharp contrast to the pattern in the " perestroika " undertaken by mikhail gorbachev in which most of the major reforms were originated by gorbachev himself .
the bottom-up approach of the deng reforms , in contrast to the top-down approach of " perestroika " , was likely a key factor in the success of the former .
deng's reforms actually included the introduction of planned , centralized management of the macro-economy by technically proficient bureaucrats , abandoning mao's mass campaign style of economic construction .
however , unlike the soviet model , management was indirect through market mechanisms .
deng sustained mao's legacy to the extent that he stressed the primacy of agricultural output and encouraged a significant decentralization of decision making in the rural economy teams and individual peasant households .
at the local level , material incentives , rather than political appeals , were to be used to motivate the labor force , including allowing peasants to earn extra income by selling the produce of their private plots at free market .
in the move toward market allocation , local municipalities and provinces were allowed to invest in industries that they considered most profitable , which encouraged investment in light manufacturing .
thus , deng's reforms shifted china's development strategy to an emphasis on light industry and export-led growth .
light industrial output was vital for a developing country coming from a low capital base .
with the short gestation period , low capital requirements , and high foreign-exchange export earnings , revenues generated by light manufacturing were able to be reinvested in technologically more advanced production and further capital expenditures and investments .
however , in sharp contrast to the similar , but much less successful reforms in the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia and the people's republic of hungary , these investments were not government mandated .
the capital invested in heavy industry largely came from the banking system , and most of that capital came from consumer deposits .
one of the first items of the deng reforms was to prevent reallocation of profits except through taxation or through the banking system ; hence , the reallocation in state-owned industries was somewhat indirect , thus making them more or less independent from government interference .
in short , deng's reforms sparked an industrial revolution in china .
these reforms were a reversal of the maoist policy of economic self-reliance .
china decided to accelerate the modernization process by stepping up the volume of foreign trade , especially the purchase of machinery from japan and the west .
by participating in such export-led growth , china was able to step up the four modernizations by attaining certain foreign funds , market , advanced technologies and management experiences , thus accelerating its economic development .
deng attracted foreign companies to a series of special economic zones , where foreign investment and market liberalization were encouraged .
the reforms sought to improve labor productivity .
new material incentives and bonus systems were introduced .
rural markets selling peasants ' homegrown products and the surplus products of communes were revived .
not only did rural markets increase agricultural output , they stimulated industrial development as well .
with peasants able to sell surplus agricultural yields on the open market , domestic consumption stimulated industrialization as well and also created political support for more difficult economic reforms .
there are some parallels between deng's market socialism especially in the early stages , and vladimir lenin's nep as well as those of nikolai bukharin's economic policies , in that both foresaw a role for private entrepreneurs and markets based on trade and pricing rather than central planning .
an interesting anecdote on this note is the first meeting between deng and armand hammer .
deng pressed the industrialist and former investor in lenin's soviet union for as much information on the nep as possible .
the tiananmen square protests of *num* , culminating in the june fourth massacre , were a series of demonstrations in and near tiananmen square in the people's republic of china ( prc ) between *num* april and *num* june *num* , a year in which many other socialist governments collapsed .
the protests were sparked by the death of hu yaobang , a reformist official backed by deng but ousted by the eight elders and the conservative wing of the politburo .
many people were dissatisfied with the party's slow response and relatively subdued funeral arrangements .
public mourning began on the streets of beijing and universities in the surrounding areas .
in beijing this was centered on the monument to the people's heroes in tiananmen square .
the mourning became a public conduit for anger against perceived nepotism in the government , the unfair dismissal and early death of hu , and the behind-the-scenes role of the " old men " .
by the eve of hu's funeral , the demonstration had reached *num* , *num* people on tiananmen square .
while the protests lacked a unified cause or leadership , participants raised the issue of corruption within the government and some voiced calls for economic liberalization and democratic reform within the structure of the government while others called for a less authoritarian and less centralized form of socialism .
during the demonstrations , deng's pro-market ally general secretary zhao ziyang supported the demonstrators and distanced himself from the politburo .
martial law was declared on *num* may by the socialist hardliner li peng , but the initial military advance on the city was blocked by residents .
the movement lasted seven weeks .
on 3–4 june , over two hundred thousand soldiers in tanks and helicopters were sent into the city to quell the protests by force , resulting in hundreds of casualties .
many ordinary people in beijing believed that deng had ordered the intervention , but political analysts do not know who was actually behind the order .
however , deng's daughter defends the actions that occurred as a collective decision by the party leadership .
to purge sympathizers of tiananmen demonstrators , the communist party initiated a one-and-a-half-year-long program similar to the anti-rightist movement .
old-timers like deng fei aimed to deal " strictly with those inside the party with serious tendencies toward bourgeois liberalization " , and more than *num* , *num* communist officers were deployed to the task .
zhao was placed under house arrest by hardliners and deng himself was forced to make concessions to them .
he soon declared that " the entire imperialist western world plans to make all socialist countries discard the socialist road and then bring them under the monopoly of international capital and onto the capitalist road " .
a few months later he said that the " united states was too deeply involved " in the student movement , referring to foreign reporters who had given financial aid to the student leaders and later helped them escape to various western countries , primarily the united states through hong kong and taiwan .
although deng initially made concessions to the socialist hardliners , he soon resumed his reforms after his *num* southern tour .
after his tour , he was able to stop the attacks of the socialist hardliners on the reforms through their " named capitalist or socialist ? " campaign .
deng privately told canadian prime minister pierre trudeau that factions of the communist party could have grabbed army units and the country had risked a civil war .
two years later , deng endorsed zhu rongji , a shanghai mayor , as a vice-premier candidate .
zhu rongji had refused to declare martial law in shanghai during the demonstrations even though socialist hardliners had pressured him .
officially , deng decided to retire from top positions when he stepped down as chairman of the central military commission in *num* , and retired from the political scene in *num* .
china , however , was still in the " era of deng xiaoping " .
he continued to be widely regarded as the " paramount leader " of the country , believed to have backroom control .
deng was recognized officially as " the chief architect of china's economic reforms and china's socialist modernization " .
to the communist party , he was believed to have set a good example for communist cadres who refused to retire at old age .
he broke earlier conventions of holding offices for life .
he was often referred to as simply " comrade xiaoping " , with no title attached .
because of the tiananmen square protests of *num* , deng's power had been significantly weakened and there was a growing formalist faction opposed to deng's reforms within the communist party .
to reassert his economic agenda , in the spring of *num* , deng made his famous southern tour of china , visiting guangzhou , shenzhen , zhuhai and spending the new year in shanghai , using his travels as a method of reasserting his economic policy after his retirement from office .
on his tour , deng made various speeches and generated large local support for his reformist platform .
he stressed the importance of economic reform in china , and criticized those who were against further reform and opening up .
although there was a debate on whether or not deng actually said it , his perceived catchphrase , " to get rich is glorious " ( 致富光荣 ) , unleashed a wave of personal entrepreneurship that continues to drive china's economy today .
he stated that the " leftist " elements of chinese society were much more dangerous than " rightist " ones .
deng was instrumental in the development of shanghai's pudong new area , revitalizing the city as china's economic hub .
his southern tour was at first ignored by the beijing and national media , which were then under the control of deng's political rivals .
jiang zemin , general secretary of the communist party of china since *num* , showed little support .
challenging their media control , shanghai's " liberation daily " newspaper published several articles supporting reforms authored by " huangfu ping " , which quickly gained support amongst local officials and populace .
deng's new wave of policy rhetoric gave way to a new political storm between factions in the politburo .
jiang eventually sided with deng , and the national media finally reported deng's southern tour several months after it occurred .
observers suggest that jiang's submission to deng's policies had solidified his position as deng's heir apparent .
behind the scenes , deng's southern tour aided his reformist allies ' climb to the apex of national power , and permanently changed china's direction toward economic development .
in addition , the eventual outcome of the southern tour proved that deng was still the most powerful man in china .
deng's insistence on economic openness aided in the phenomenal growth levels of the coastal areas , especially the " golden triangle " region surrounding shanghai .
deng reiterated that " some areas must get rich before others " , and asserted that the wealth from coastal regions will eventually be transferred to aid economic construction inland .
the theory , however , faced numerous challenges when put into practice , as provincial governments moved to protect their own interests .
deng died on *num* february *num* , aged *num* from a lung infection and parkinson's disease .
even though his successor jiang zemin was in firm control , government policies maintained deng's political and economic philosophies .
officially , deng was eulogized as a " great marxist , great proletarian revolutionary , statesman , military strategist , and diplomat ; one of the main leaders of the communist party of china , the people's liberation army of china , and the people's republic of china ; the great architect of china's socialist opening-up and modernized construction ; the founder of deng xiaoping theory " .
the public was largely prepared for deng's death , as rumors had been circulating for a long time that his health was deteriorating .
at *num* : *num* on the morning of *num* february , people were asked by premier li peng to pause in silence for three minutes .
the nation's flags flew at half-mast for over a week .
the nationally televised funeral , which was a simple and relatively private affair attended by the country's leaders and deng's family , was broadcast on all cable channels .
after the funeral , his organs were donated to medical research , the remains were cremated , and his ashes were subsequently scattered at sea , according to his wishes .
for the next two weeks , chinese state media ran news stories and documentaries related to deng's life and death , with the regular *num* : *num* " national news " program in the evening lasting almost two hours over the regular broadcast time .
certain segments of the chinese population , notably the modern maoists and radical reformers ( the far left and the far right ) , had negative views on deng .
in the year that followed , songs like " story of spring " by dong wenhua , which were created in deng's honour shortly after deng's southern tour in *num* , once again were widely played .
there was a significant amount of international reaction to deng's death : un secretary-general kofi annan said deng was to be remembered " in the international community at large as a primary architect of china's modernization and dramatic economic development " .
french president jacques chirac said " in the course of this century , few men have , as much as deng , led a vast human community through such profound and determining changes " ; british prime minister john major commented about deng's key role in the return of hong kong to chinese control ; canadian prime minister jean chrétien called deng a " pivotal figure " in chinese history .
the kuomintang chair in taiwan also sent its condolences , saying it longed for peace , cooperation , and prosperity .
the dalai lama voiced regret .
when compared to the memorials of other cpc leaders , those dedicated to deng have been low profile , in keeping with deng's image of pragmatism .
moreover , he was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea , as opposed to being embalmed like mao .
there are a few public displays of deng in the country .
a bronze statue of deng was erected on *num* november *num* , at the grand plaza of lianhua mountain park in shenzhen .
this statue is dedicated to deng's role as a planner and contributor to the development of the shenzhen special economic zone , starting in *num* .
the statue is high , with an additional *num* .
68-meter base .
the statue shows deng striding forward confidently .
many cpc high level leaders visit the statue .
in addition , in coastal areas and on the island province of hainan , deng is seen on roadside billboards with messages emphasizing economic reform or his policy of one country , two systems .
another bronze statue of deng was dedicated *num* august *num* in the city of guang'an , deng's hometown , in southwest china's sichuan province .
the statue was erected to commemorate deng's *ord* birthday .
the statue shows deng , dressed casually , sitting on a chair and smiling .
the chinese characters for " statue of deng xiaoping " are inscribed on the pedestal .
the original calligraphy was written by jiang , then chairman of the central military commission .
deng xiaoping's former residence in his hometown of paifang village in sichuan province has been preserved as a museum telling deng's life story .
in bishkek , capital of kyrgyzstan , there is a six-lane boulevard , wide and long , the " deng xiaoping prospekt " , which was dedicated on *num* june *num* .
a two-meter high red granite monument stands at the east end of this route .
the epigraph in memory of deng is written in chinese , russian and kirghiz .
a documentary on deng entitled " deng xiaoping " was released by cctv in january *num* that chronicles his life from his days as a student in france to his " southern tour " of *num* .
in *num* , a tv series commemorating deng entitled " deng xiaoping at history's crossroads " was released by cctv in anticipation of the *ord* anniversary of his birth .
brittonic languages the brittonic , brythonic or british celtic languages ( ; ; ) form one of the two branches of the insular celtic language family ; the other is goidelic .
the name " brythonic " was derived by welsh celticist john rhys from the welsh word , meaning an indigenous briton as opposed to an anglo-saxon or gael .
the name " brittonic " derives ultimately from the name ( ) , recorded by greek authors for the british isles .
the brittonic languages derive from the common brittonic language , spoken throughout great britain south of the firth of forth during the iron age and roman period .
in addition , north of the forth , the pictish language is considered to be related ; it is possible it was a brittonic language , but it may have been a sister language .
in the *ord* and *ord* centuries emigrating britons also took brittonic speech to the continent , most significantly in brittany and britonia .
during the next few centuries the language began to split into several dialects , eventually evolving into welsh , cornish , breton and cumbric .
welsh and breton continue to be spoken as native languages , while a revival in cornish has led to an increase in speakers of that language .
cumbric is extinct , having been replaced by goidelic and english speech .
the isle of man and orkney may also have originally spoken a brittonic language , later replaced with a goidelic one .
due to emigration , there are also communities of brittonic language speakers in england , france , and ( the welsh settlement in patagonia ) .
the names " brittonic " and " brythonic " are scholarly conventions referring to the celtic languages of britain and to the ancestral language they originated from , designated common brittonic , in contrast to the goidelic languages originating in ireland .
both were created in the *ord* century to avoid the ambiguity of earlier terms such as " british " and " cymric " .
" brythonic " was coined in *num* by the celticist john rhys from the welsh word .
" brittonic " , derived from " briton " and also earlier spelled " britonic " and " britonnic " , emerged later in the *ord* century .
it became more prominent through the *ord* century , and was used in kenneth h .
jackson's highly influential *num* work on the topic , " language and history in early britain " .
jackson noted that by that time " brythonic " had become a dated term , and that " of late there has been an increasing tendency to use brittonic instead .
" today , " brittonic " often replaces " brythonic " in the literature .
rudolf thurneysen used " britannic " in his influential " a grammar of old irish " , though this never became popular among subsequent scholars .
comparable historical terms include the medieval latin and and the welsh .
some writers use " british " for the language and its descendants , though due to the risk of confusion , others avoid it or use it only in a restricted sense .
jackson , and later john t .
koch , use " british " only for the early phase of the common brittonic language .
prior to jackson's work , " brittonic " ( and " brythonic " ) were often used for all the p-celtic languages , including not just the varieties in britain but those continental celtic languages that similarly experienced the evolution of the proto-celtic language element to .
however , subsequent writers have tended to follow jackson's scheme , rendering this use obsolete .
knowledge of the brittonic languages comes from a variety of sources .
for the early languages information is obtained from coins , inscriptions and comments by classical writers as well as place names and personal names recorded by them .
for later languages there is information from medieval writers and modern native speakers , together with place names .
the names recorded in the roman period are given in rivet and smith .
the brittonic branch is also referred to as p-celtic because linguistic reconstruction of the brittonic reflex of the proto-indo-european phoneme *"kʷ " is " p " as opposed to goidelic " c " .
such nomenclature usually implies an acceptance of the p-celtic and q-celtic hypothesis rather than the insular celtic hypothesis because the term includes certain continental celtic languages as well .
( for a discussion , see celtic languages .
) other major characteristics include : initial " s- " : lenition : voiceless spirants : nasal assimilation : the family tree of the brittonic languages is as follows : brittonic languages in use today are welsh , cornish and breton .
welsh and breton have been spoken continuously since they formed .
for all practical purposes cornish died out during the *ord* or *ord* centuries , but a revival movement has more recently created small numbers of new speakers .
also notable are the extinct language cumbric , and possibly the extinct pictish .
one view , advanced in the 1950s and based on apparently unintelligible ogham inscriptions , was that the picts may have also used a non-indo-european language .
this view , while attracting broad popular appeal , has virtually no following in contemporary linguistic scholarship .
the modern brittonic languages are generally considered to all derive from a common ancestral language termed " brittonic " , " british " , " common brittonic " , " old brittonic " or " proto-brittonic " , which is thought to have developed from proto-celtic or early insular celtic by the *ord* century bc .
brittonic languages were probably spoken prior to the roman invasion at least in the majority of great britain south of the rivers forth and clyde , though the isle of man later had a goidelic language , manx .
northern scotland mainly spoke pritennic , which became the pictish language , which may have been a brittonic language like that of its neighbors .
the theory has been advanced ( notably by t .
f .
o'rahilly ) that part of ireland spoke a brittonic language , usually termed " ivernic " , before it was displaced by primitive irish , although the authors dillon and chadwick reject this theory as being implausible .
during the period of the roman occupation of what are now england and wales ( ad *num* to c .
*num* ) , common brittonic borrowed a large stock of latin words , both for concepts unfamiliar in the pre-urban society of celtic britain such as urbanisation and new tactics of warfare as well as for rather more mundane words which displaced native terms ( most notably , the word for " fish " in all the brittonic languages derives from the latin " piscis " rather than the native *"ēskos " - which may survive , however , in the welsh name of the river usk , ) .
approximately *num* of these latin loan-words have survived in the three modern brittonic languages .
it is probable that at the start of the post-roman period " common brittonic " was differentiated into at least two major dialect groups – southwestern and western ( in addition we may posit additional dialects , such as eastern brittonic , spoken in what is now the east of england , which have left little or no evidence ) .
between the end of the roman occupation and the mid *ord* century the two dialects began to diverge into recognisably separate languages , the western into cumbric and welsh and the southwestern into cornish and its closely related sister language breton , which was carried to continental armorica .
jackson showed that a few of the dialect distinctions between west and southwest brittonic go back a long way .
new divergencies began around ad *num* but other changes which were shared occurred in the *ord* century .
other common changes occurred in the *ord* century onward and are possibly due to inherent tendencies .
thus the concept of a common brittonic language ends by ad *num* .
substantial numbers of britons certainly remained in the expanding area controlled by anglo-saxons , but over the fifth and sixth centuries they mostly adopted the english language .
the brittonic languages spoken in what is now scotland , the isle of man and what is now england began to be displaced in the *ord* century through the settlement of irish-speaking gaels and germanic peoples .
the displacement of the languages of brittonic descent was probably complete in all of britain except cornwall and wales and the english counties bordering these areas such as devon by the *ord* century .
western herefordshire continued to speak welsh until the late nineteenth century , and isolated pockets of shropshire speak welsh today .
the regular consonantal sound changes from proto-celtic to welsh , cornish and breton are summarised in the following table .
where the graphemes have a different value from the corresponding ipa symbols , the ipa equivalent is indicated between slashes .
v represents a vowel ; c represents a consonant .
the principal legacy left behind in those territories from which the brittonic languages were displaced is that of toponyms ( place names ) and hydronyms ( river names ) .
there are many brittonic place names in lowland scotland and in the parts of england where it is agreed that substantial brittonic speakers remained ( brittonic names , apart from those of the former romano-british towns , are scarce over most of england ) .
names derived ( sometimes indirectly ) from brittonic include london , penicuik , perth , aberdeen , york , dorchester , dover and colchester .
brittonic elements found in england include " bre- " and " bal- " for hills , while some such as combe or coomb ( e ) for a small deep valley and tor for a hill are examples of brittonic words that were borrowed into english .
others reflect the presence of britons such as dumbarton – from the scottish gaelic " dùn breatainn " meaning " fort of the britons " , or walton meaning a " tun " or settlement where the " wealh " " britons " still lived .
the number of celtic river names in england generally increases from east to west , a map showing these being given by jackson .
these names include ones such as avon , chew , frome , axe , brue and exe , but also river names containing the elements " der- / dar- / dur- " and " -went " e .
g .
" derwent , darwen , deer , adur , dour , darent , went " .
in fact these names exhibit multiple different celtic roots .
one is *dubri- " water " [ bret .
" dour " , c .
" dowr " , w .
" dŵr " ] , also found in the place-name " dover " ( attested in the roman period as " dubrīs " ) ; this is the original source of rivers named " dour " .
another is *deru̯o- " oak " or " true " [ bret .
" derv " , c .
" derow " , w .
" derw " ] , coupled with two agent suffixes , *-ent- and *-iū ; this is the origin of " derwent " , " darent " and " darwen " ( attested in the roman period as " deru̯entiō " ) .
the final root to be examined is " went " .
in roman britain there were three tribal capitals named " u̯entā " ( modern winchester , caerwent and caistor st edmunds ) , whose meaning was ' place , town ' .
some , including j .
r .
r .
tolkien have argued that celtic has acted as a substrate to english for both the lexicon and syntax .
it is generally accepted that linguistic effects on english were lexically rather poor aside from toponyms , consisting of a few domestic words , which may include hubbub , dad , peat , bucket , crock , crumpet ( cf .
br .
krampouz ) , noggin , gob ( cf .
gaelic gob ) , nook ; and the dialectal term for a badger , i .
e .
" brock " ( cf .
welsh broch , c .
brogh and gaelic broc ) .
another legacy may be the sheep-counting system yan tan tethera in the west , in the traditionally celtic areas of england such as cumbria .
several cornish mining words are still in use in english language mining terminology , such as costean , gunnies , and vug .
those who argue against the theory of a brittonic substratum and heavy influence point out that many toponyms have no semantic continuation from the brittonic language .
a notable example is avon which comes from the celtic term for river abona or the welsh term for river , afon , but was used by the english as a personal name .
likewise the river ouse , yorkshire contains the word usa which merely means ‘water’ and the name of the river trent simply comes from the welsh word for a trespasser " ( an over-flowing river ) " it has been argued that the use of periphrastic constructions ( using auxiliary verbs such as " do " and " be " in the continuous / progressive ) in the english verb , which is more widespread than in the other germanic languages , is traceable to brittonic influence .
some however find this very unlikely and claim a native english development rather than celtic influence , though roberts postulates northern germanic influence , despite such constructions not existing in norse .
literary welsh has the simple present caraf = " i love " and the present stative ( al .
continuous / progressive ) yr wyf yn caru = " i am loving " , where the brittonic syntax is partly mirrored in english ( note that " i am loving " comes from older " i am a-loving " , from still older ich am on luvende “i am in the process of loving” ) .
in the germanic sister languages of english there is only one form , for example ich liebe in german , though in " colloquial " usage in some german dialects , a progressive aspect form has evolved which is formally similar to those found in celtic languages , and somewhat less similar to the modern english form , e .
g .
“i am working” is ich bin am arbeiten , literally : “i am on the working” .
the same structure is also found in modern dutch ( ik ben aan het werk ) , alongside other structures ( e .
g .
ik zit te werken , lit .
“i sit to working” ) .
these parallel developments suggest that the english progressive is not necessarily due to celtic influence ; moreover , the native english development of the structure can be traced over the over *num* years of english literature .
some researchers ( filppula " et al .
" , *num* ) argue that english syntax reflects more extensive brittonic influences .
for instance , in english tag questions , the form of the tag depends on the verb form in the main statement ( " aren't i ? " , " isn't he ? " , " won't we ? " etc .
) .
the german nicht wahr ? and the french n’est-ce pas ? , by contrast , are fixed forms which can be used with almost any main statement .
it has been claimed that the english system has been borrowed from brittonic , since welsh tag questions vary in almost exactly the same way .
far more notable , but less well known , are brittonic influences on scottish gaelic , though scottish and irish gaelic , with their wider range of preposition-based periphastic constructions , suggest that such constructions descend from their common celtic heritage .
scottish gaelic contains a number of apparently p-celtic loanwords , but as there is a far greater overlap in terms of celtic vocabulary , than with english , it is not always possible to disentangle p- and q-celtic words .
however some common words such as monadh = welsh mynydd , cumbric *monidh are particularly evident .
often the brittonic influence on scots gaelic is indicated by considering irish language usage , which is not likely to have been influenced so much by brittonic .
in particular , the word srath ( anglicised as “strath” ) is a native goidelic word , but its usage appears to have been modified by the brittonic cognate ystrad whose meaning is slightly different .
the effect on irish has been the loan from british of many latin-derived words .
this has been associated with the christianisation of ireland from britain .
common language infrastructure the common language infrastructure ( cli ) is an open specification ( technical standard ) developed by microsoft and standardized by iso and ecma that describes executable code and a runtime environment that allows multiple high-level languages to be used on different computer platforms without being rewritten for specific architectures .
this implies it is platform agnostic .
the .
net framework , .
net core , mono , dotgnu and portable .
net are implementations of the cli .
among other things , the cli specification describes the following four aspects : all compatible languages compile to common intermediate language ( cil ) , which is an intermediate language that is abstracted from the platform hardware .
when the code is executed , the platform-specific ves will compile the cil to the machine language according to the specific hardware and operating system .
in august *num* , microsoft , hewlett-packard , intel , and others worked to standardize cli .
by december *num* , it was ratified by the ecma , with iso standardization following in april *num* .
microsoft and its partners hold patents for cli .
ecma and iso require that all patents essential to implementation be made available under " reasonable and non-discriminatory ( rand ) terms .
" it is common for rand licensing to require some royalty payment , which could be a cause for concern with mono .
as of january *num* , neither microsoft nor its partners have identified any patents essential to cli implementations subject to rand terms .
as of july *num* , microsoft added c# and cli to the list of specifications that the microsoft community promise applies to , so anyone can safely implement specified editions of the standards without fearing a patent lawsuit from microsoft .
to implement the cli standard requires conformance to one of the supported and defined profiles of the standard , the minimum of which is the kernel profile .
the kernel profile is actually a very small set of types to support in comparison to the well known core library of default .
net installations .
however , the conformance clause of the cli allows for extending the supported profile by adding new methods and types to classes , as well as deriving from new namespaces .
but it does not allow for adding new members to interfaces .
this means that the features of the cli can be used and extended , as long as the conforming profile implementation does not change the behavior of a program intended to run on that profile , while allowing for unspecified behavior from programs written specifically for that implementation .
in *num* , ecma and iso published the new edition of the cli standard , which is not covered by the community promise .
amyl alcohol an amyl alcohol is any of *num* alcohols with the formula cho .
a mixture of amyl alcohols ( also called amyl alcohol ) can be obtained from fusel alcohol .
amyl alcohol is used as a solvent and in esterfication , by which is produced amyl acetate and other important products .
the name " amyl alcohol " without further specification applies to the normal ( straight-chain ) form , 1-pentanol .
these are the *num* structural isomers of alcohols with molecular formula cho : three of these alcohols , active amyl alcohol ( 2-methylbutan-1-ol ) , methyl ( n ) propyl carbinol ( pentan-2-ol ) , and methyl isopropyl carbinol ( 3-methylbutan-2-ol ) , contain an asymmetric carbon atom and are therefore optically active .
the most important is isobutyl carbinol , the chief constituent of fermentation amyl alcohol and a constituent of fusel oil .
it can be separated from fusel oil by either of two methods : shaking with strong brine solution and separating the oily layer from the brine layer ; distilling it and collecting the fraction that boils between *num* and *num* °c .
further purification is possible with this procedure : shaking the product with hot limewater , separating the oily layer , drying the product with calcium chloride , and distilling it , collecting the fraction boiling between *num* and *num* °c .
isobutyl carbinol can be synthesized from isobutanol by conversion into isovaleraldehyde , which is subsequently reduced to isobutyl carbinol by means of sodium amalgam .
it is a colourless liquid of density *num* .
*num* g / cm³ ( *num* °c ) , boiling at *num* .
*num* °c , slightly soluble in water , and easily dissolved in organic solvents .
it has a characteristic strong smell and a sharp burning taste .
amyl alcohol has an oral ld50 of *num* mg / kg in mice , suggesting that it is significantly more toxic than ethanol .
on passing the vapour through a red-hot tube , it decomposes into acetylene , ethylene , propylene , and other compounds .
it is oxidized by chromic acid to isovaleraldehyde , and it forms addition compounds crystals with calcium chloride and tin ( iv ) chloride .
the other amyl alcohols may be obtained synthetically .
of these , tertiary butyl carbinol has been the most difficult to obtain , with the first reported synthesis in *num* by l .
tissier using the reduction of a mixture of trimethyl acetic acid and trimethylacetyl chloride with sodium amalgam .
it is a solid that melts at *num* to *num* °c and boils at *num* .

atlantis atlantis ( , " island of atlas " ) is a fictional island mentioned within an allegory on the hubris of nations in plato's works " timaeus " and " critias " , where it represents the antagonist naval power that besieges " ancient athens " , the pseudo-historic embodiment of plato's ideal state in " the republic " .
in the story , athens repels the atlantean attack unlike any other nation of the known world , supposedly giving testament to the superiority of plato's concept of a state .
the story concludes with atlantis falling out of favor with the deities and submerging into the atlantic ocean .
despite its minor importance in plato's work , the atlantis story has had a considerable impact on literature .
the allegorical aspect of atlantis was taken up in utopian works of several renaissance writers , such as francis bacon's " new atlantis " and thomas more's " utopia " .
on the other hand , nineteenth-century amateur scholars misinterpreted plato's narrative as historical tradition , most notably in ignatius l .
donnelly's " " .
plato's vague indications of the time of the events—more than *num* , *num* years before his time—and the alleged location of atlantis—"beyond the pillars of hercules"—has led to much pseudoscientific speculation .
as a consequence , atlantis has become a byword for any and all supposed advanced prehistoric lost civilizations and continues to inspire contemporary fiction , from comic books to films .
while present-day philologists and classicists agree on the story's fictional character , there is still debate on what served as its inspiration .
as for instance with the story of gyges , plato is known to have freely borrowed some of his allegories and metaphors from older traditions .
this led a number of scholars to investigate possible inspiration of atlantis from egyptian records of the thera eruption , the sea peoples invasion , or the trojan war .
others have rejected this chain of tradition as implausible and insist that plato created an entirely fictional nation as his example , drawing loose inspiration from contemporary events such as the failed athenian invasion of sicily in 415–413 bc or the destruction of helike in *num* bc .
the only primary sources for atlantis are plato's dialogues " timaeus " and " critias " ; all other mentions of the island are based on them .
the dialogues claim to quote solon , who visited egypt between *num* and *num* bc ; they state that he translated egyptian records of atlantis .
written in *num* bc , plato introduced atlantis in " timaeus " : the four people appearing in those two dialogues are the politicians critias and hermocrates as well as the philosophers socrates and timaeus of locri , although only critias speaks of atlantis .
in his works plato makes extensive use of the socratic method in order to discuss contrary positions within the context of a supposition .
the " timaeus " begins with an introduction , followed by an account of the creations and structure of the universe and ancient civilizations .
in the introduction , socrates muses about the perfect society , described in plato's " republic " ( c .
*num* bc ) , and wonders if he and his guests might recollect a story which exemplifies such a society .
critias mentions a tale he considered to be historical , that would make the perfect example , and he then follows by describing atlantis as is recorded in the " critias " .
in his account , ancient athens seems to represent the " perfect society " and atlantis its opponent , representing the very antithesis of the " perfect " traits described in the " republic " .
according to critias , the hellenic deities of old divided the land so that each deity might have their own lot ; poseidon was appropriately , and to his liking , bequeathed the island of atlantis .
the island was larger than ancient libya and asia minor combined , but it was later sunk by an earthquake and became an impassable mud shoal , inhibiting travel to any part of the ocean .
plato asserted that the egyptians described atlantis as an island consisting mostly of mountains in the northern portions and along the shore and encompassing a great plain in an oblong shape in the south " extending in one direction three thousand " stadia " [ about *num* km ; *num* mi ] , but across the center inland it was two thousand stadia [ about *num* km ; *num* mi ] .
" fifty stadia [ *num* km ; *num* mi ] from the coast was a mountain that was low on all sides .
.
.
broke it off all round about .
.
.
the central island itself was five stades in diameter [ about *num* .
*num* km ; *num* .
*num* mi ] .
in plato's metaphorical tale , poseidon fell in love with cleito , the daughter of evenor and leucippe , who bore him five pairs of male twins .
the eldest of these , atlas , was made rightful king of the entire island and the ocean ( called the atlantic ocean in his honor ) , and was given the mountain of his birth and the surrounding area as his fiefdom .
atlas's twin gadeirus , or eumelus in greek , was given the extremity of the island toward the pillars of hercules .
the other four pairs of twins—ampheres and evaemon , mneseus and autochthon , elasippus and mestor , and azaes and diaprepes—were also given " rule over many men , and a large territory .
" poseidon carved the mountain where his love dwelt into a palace and enclosed it with three circular moats of increasing width , varying from one to three stadia and separated by rings of land proportional in size .
the atlanteans then built bridges northward from the mountain , making a route to the rest of the island .
they dug a great canal to the sea , and alongside the bridges carved tunnels into the rings of rock so that ships could pass into the city around the mountain ; they carved docks from the rock walls of the moats .
every passage to the city was guarded by gates and towers , and a wall surrounded each ring of the city .
the walls were constructed of red , white , and black rock , quarried from the moats , and were covered with brass , tin , and the precious metal orichalcum , respectively .
according to critias , *num* , *num* years before his lifetime a war took place between those outside the pillars of hercules at the strait of gibraltar and those who dwelt within them .
the atlanteans had conquered the parts of libya within the pillars of hercules , as far as egypt , and the european continent as far as tyrrhenia , and had subjected its people to slavery .
the athenians led an alliance of resistors against the atlantean empire , and as the alliance disintegrated , prevailed alone against the empire , liberating the occupied lands .
the logographer hellanicus of lesbos wrote an earlier work entitled " atlantis " , of which only a few fragments survive .
hellanicus ' work appears to have been a genealogical one concerning the daughters of atlas ( ἀτλαντὶς in greek means " of atlas " ) , but some authors have suggested a possible connection with plato's island .

luce notes that when plato writes about the genealogy of atlantis's kings , he writes in the same style as hellanicus , suggesting a similarity between a fragment of hellanicus's work and an account in the " critias " .
rodney castleden suggests that plato may have borrowed his title from hellanicus , who may have based his work on an earlier work about atlantis .
castleden has pointed out that plato wrote of atlantis in *num* bc , when he returned to athens from sicily .
he notes a number of parallels between the physical organisation and fortifications of syracuse and plato's description of atlantis .
gunnar rudberg was the first who elaborated upon the idea that plato's attempt to realize his political ideas in the city of syracuse could have heavily inspired the atlantis account .
some ancient writers viewed atlantis as fictional or metaphorical myth ; others believed it to be real .
aristotle believed that plato , his teacher , had invented the island to teach philosophy .
the philosopher crantor , a student of plato's student xenocrates , is cited often as an example of a writer who thought the story to be historical fact .
his work , a commentary on " timaeus " , is lost , but proclus , a neoplatonist of the fifth century ad , reports on it .
the passage in question has been represented in the modern literature either as claiming that crantor visited egypt , had conversations with priests , and saw hieroglyphs confirming the story , or , as claiming that he learned about them from other visitors to egypt .
proclus wrote : the next sentence is often translated " crantor adds , that this is testified by the prophets of the egyptians , who assert that these particulars [ which are narrated by plato ] are written on pillars which are still preserved .
" but in the original , the sentence starts not with the name crantor but with the ambiguous " he " ; whether this referred to crantor or to plato is the subject of considerable debate .
proponents of both atlantis as a metaphorical myth and atlantis as history have argued that the pronoun refers to crantor .
alan cameron argues that the pronoun should be interpreted as referring to plato , and that , when proclus writes that " we must bear in mind concerning this whole feat of the athenians , that it is neither a mere myth nor unadorned history , although some take it as history and others as myth " , he is treating " crantor's view as mere personal opinion , nothing more ; in fact he first quotes and then dismisses it as representing one of the two unacceptable extremes " .
cameron also points out that whether " he " refers to plato or to crantor , the statement does not support conclusions such as otto muck's " crantor came to sais and saw there in the temple of neith the column , completely covered with hieroglyphs , on which the history of atlantis was recorded .
scholars translated it for him , and he testified that their account fully agreed with plato's account of atlantis " or j .
v .
luce's suggestion that crantor sent " a special enquiry to egypt " and that he may simply be referring to plato's own claims .
another passage from the commentary by proclus on the " timaeus " gives a description of the geography of atlantis : marcellus remains unidentified .
other ancient historians and philosophers who believed in the existence of atlantis were strabo and posidonius .
some have theorized that , before the sixth century bc , the " pillars of hercules " may have applied to mountains on either side of the gulf of laconia , and also may have been part of the pillar cult of the aegean .
the mountains stood at either side of the southernmost gulf in greece , the largest in the peloponnese , and it opens onto the mediterranean sea .
this would have placed atlantis in the mediterranean , lending credence to many details in plato's discussion .
the fourth-century historian ammianus marcellinus , relying on a lost work by timagenes , a historian writing in the first century bc , writes that the druids of gaul said that part of the inhabitants of gaul had migrated there from distant islands .
some have understood ammianus's testimony as a claim that at the time of atlantis's sinking into the sea , its inhabitants fled to western europe ; but ammianus , in fact , says that " the drasidae ( druids ) recall that a part of the population is indigenous but others also migrated in from islands and lands beyond the rhine " ( " res gestae " *num* .
*num* ) , an indication that the immigrants came to gaul from the north ( britain , the netherlands , or germany ) , not from a theorized location in the atlantic ocean to the south-west .
instead , the celts who dwelled along the ocean were reported to venerate twin gods , ( dioscori ) , who appeared to them coming from that ocean .
during the early first century , the hellenistic jewish philosopher philo wrote about the destruction of atlantis in his " on the eternity of the world " , xxvi .
*num* , in a longer passage allegedly citing aristotle's successor theophrastus : the theologian joseph barber lightfoot ( " apostolic fathers " , *num* , ii , p .
*num* ) noted on this passage : " clement may possibly be referring to some known , but hardly accessible land , lying without the pillars of hercules .
but more probably he contemplated some unknown land in the far west beyond the ocean , like the fabled atlantis of plato .
.
.
" other early christian writers wrote about atlantis , although they had mixed views on whether it once existed or was an untrustworthy myth of pagan origin .
tertullian believed atlantis was once real and wrote that in the atlantic ocean once existed " [ the isle ] that was equal in size to libya or asia " referring to plato's geographical description of atlantis .
the early christian apologist writer arnobius also believed atlantis once existed , but blamed its destruction on pagans .
cosmas indicopleustes in the sixth century wrote of atlantis in his " christian topography " in an attempt to prove his theory that the world was flat and surrounded by water : aside from plato's original account , modern interpretations regarding atlantis are an amalgamation of diverse , speculative movements that began in the sixteenth century , when scholars began to identify atlantis with the new world .
francisco lopez de gomara was the first to state that plato was referring to america , as did francis bacon and alexander von humboldt ; janus joannes bircherod said in *num* " orbe novo non novo " ( " the new world is not new " ) .
athanasius kircher accepted plato's account as literally true , describing atlantis as a small continent in the atlantic ocean .
contemporary perceptions of atlantis share roots with mayanism , which can be traced to the beginning of the modern age , when european imaginations were fueled by their initial encounters with the indigenous peoples of the americas .
from this era sprang apocalyptic and utopian visions that would inspire many subsequent generations of theorists .
most of these interpretations are considered pseudohistory , pseudoscience , or pseudoarchaeology , as they have presented their works as academic or scientific , but lack the standards or criteria .
the flemish cartographer and geographer abraham ortelius is believed to have been the first person to imagine that the continents were joined together before drifting to their present positions .
in the *num* edition of his " thesaurus geographicus " he wrote : " unless it be a fable , the island of gadir or gades will be the remaining part of the island of atlantis or america , which was not sunk ( as plato reports in the " timaeus " ) so much as torn away from europe and africa by earthquakes and flood .
.
.
the traces of the ruptures are shown by the projections of europe and africa and the indentations of america in the parts of the coasts of these three said lands that face each other to anyone who , using a map of the world , carefully considered them .
so that anyone may say with strabo in book *num* , that what plato says of the island of atlantis on the authority of solon is not a figment .
" the term " utopia " ( from " no place " ) was coined by sir thomas more in his sixteenth-century work of fiction " utopia " .
inspired by plato's atlantis and travelers ' accounts of the americas , more described an imaginary land set in the new world .
his idealistic vision established a connection between the americas and utopian societies , a theme that bacon discussed in " the new atlantis " ( c .
*num* ) .
a character in the narrative gives a history of atlantis that is similar to plato's and places atlantis in america .
people had begun believing that the mayan and aztec ruins could possibly be the remnants of atlantis .
much speculation began as to the origins of the maya , which led to a variety of narratives and publications that tried to rationalize the discoveries within the context of the bible and that had undertones of racism in their connections between the old and new world .
the europeans believed the indigenous people to be inferior and incapable of building that which was now in ruins and by sharing a common history , they insinuate that another race must have been responsible .
in the middle and late nineteenth century , several renowned mesoamerican scholars , starting with charles etienne brasseur de bourbourg , and including edward herbert thompson and augustus le plongeon , formally proposed that atlantis was somehow related to mayan and aztec culture .
the french scholar brasseur de bourbourg traveled extensively through mesoamerica in the mid-1800s , and was renowned for his translations of mayan texts , most notably the sacred book popol vuh , as well as a comprehensive history of the region .
soon after these publications , however , brasseur de bourbourg lost his academic credibility , due to his claim that the maya peoples had descended from the toltecs , people he believed were the surviving population of the racially superior civilization of atlantis .
his work combined with the skillful , romantic illustrations of jean frederic waldeck , which visually alluded to egypt and other aspects of the old world , created an authoritative fantasy that excited much interest in the connections between worlds .
inspired by brasseur de bourbourg's diffusion theories , the pseudoarchaeologist augustus le plongeon traveled to mesoamerica and performed some of the first excavations of many famous mayan ruins .
le plongeon invented narratives , such as the kingdom of mu saga , which romantically drew connections to him , his wife alice , and egyptian deities osiris and isis , as well as to heinrich schliemann , who had just discovered the ancient city of troy from homer's epic poetry ( that had been described as merely mythical ) .
he also believed that he had found connections between the greek and mayan languages , which produced a narrative of the destruction of atlantis .
the *num* publication of " " by ignatius l .
donnelly stimulated much popular interest in atlantis .
he was greatly inspired by early works in mayanism , and like them , attempted to establish that all known ancient civilizations were descended from atlantis , which he saw as a technologically sophisticated , more advanced culture .
donnelly drew parallels between creation stories in the old and new worlds , attributing the connections to atlantis , where he believed the biblical garden of eden existed .
as implied by the title of his book , he also believed that atlantis was destroyed by the great flood mentioned in the bible .
donnelly is credited as the " father of the nineteenth century atlantis revival " and is the reason the myth endures today .
he unintentionally promoted an alternative method of inquiry to history and science , and the idea that myths contain hidden information that opens them to " ingenious " interpretation by people who believe they have new or special insight .
the russian mystic helena petrovna blavatsky and her partner henry steel olcott founded their theosophical society in the 1870s with a philosophy that combined western romanticism and eastern religious concepts .
blavatsky and her followers in this group are often cited as the founders of new age and other spiritual movements .
blavatsky took up donnelly's interpretations when she wrote " the secret doctrine " ( *num* ) , which she claimed was originally dictated in atlantis .
she maintained that the atlanteans were cultural heroes ( contrary to plato , who describes them mainly as a military threat ) .
she believed in a form of racial evolution ( as opposed to primate evolution ) , in which the atlanteans were the fourth " root race " , succeeded by the fifth and most superior " aryan race " ( the modern human race ) .
the theosophists believed that the civilization of atlantis reached its peak between *num* , *num* , *num* and *num* , *num* years ago , but destroyed itself through internal warfare brought about by the dangerous use of psychic and supernatural powers of the inhabitants .
rudolf steiner , the founder of anthroposophy and waldorf schools , along with other well known theosophists , such as annie besant , also wrote of cultural evolution in much the same vein .
some subsequent occultists have followed blavatsky , at least to the point of tracing the lineage of occult practices back to atlantis .
among the most famous is dion fortune in her " esoteric orders and their work " .
blavatsky was also inspired by the work of the eighteenth-century astronomer jean-sylvain bailly , who had " orientalized " the atlantis myth in his mythical continent of hyperborea , a reference to greek myths featuring a northern european region of the same name , home to a giant , godlike race .
dan edelstein claims that her reshaping of this theory in " the secret doctrine " provided the nazis with a mythological precedent and a pretext for their ideological platform and their subsequent genocide .
however , blavatsky's writings mention that the atlantean were in fact olive-skinned peoples with mongoloid traits who were the ancestors of modern native americans , mongolians and malayans .
julius evola's writing in *num* also suggested that the atlanteans were hyperborean , nordic supermen who originated at the north pole ( see thule ) .
similarly , alfred rosenberg ( in " the myth of the twentieth century " , *num* ) spoke of a " nordic-atlantean " or " aryan-nordic " master race .
this ideas may contradict the beliefs of several esoteric and theosophic groups that , on the contrary , thought that the atlanteans were non-caucasian brown-skinned peoples .
also some esoteric groups , including the theosophic society , do not consider atlantean society to have been superior or utopian—they rather consider it a lower stage of evolution .
edgar cayce was a man from humble upbringings in kentucky who allegedly possessed psychic abilities , which were performed from a trance-like state .
in addition to allegedly healing the sick from this state , he also spoke frequently on the topic of atlantis .
in his " life readings , " he purportedly revealed that many of his subjects were reincarnations of people who had lived on atlantis .
by tapping into their collective consciousness , the " akashic records " ( a term borrowed from theosophy ) , he declared that he was able to give detailed descriptions of the lost continent .
he also asserted that atlantis would " rise " again in the 1960s ( sparking much popularity of the myth in that decade ) and that there is a " hall of records " beneath the egyptian sphinx , which holds the historical texts of atlantis .
as continental drift became widely accepted during the 1960s , and the increased understanding of plate tectonics demonstrated the impossibility of a lost continent in the geologically recent past , most " lost continent " theories of atlantis began to wane in popularity .
plato scholar julia annas , regents professor of philosophy at the university of arizona , had this to say on the matter : one of the proposed explanations for the historical context of the atlantis story is a warning of plato to his contemporary fourth-century fellow-citizens against their striving for naval power .
kenneth feder points out that critias's story in the " timaeus " provides a major clue .
in the dialogue , critias says , referring to socrates ' hypothetical society : feder quotes a .
e .
taylor , who wrote , " we could not be told much more plainly that the whole narrative of solon's conversation with the priests and his intention of writing the poem about atlantis are an invention of plato's fancy .
" since donnelly's day , there have been dozens of locations proposed for atlantis , to the point where the name has become a generic concept , divorced from the specifics of plato's account .
this is reflected in the fact that many proposed sites are not within the atlantic at all .
few today are scholarly or archaeological hypotheses , while others have been made by psychic ( e .
g .
, edgar cayce ) or other pseudoscientific means .
( the atlantis researchers jacques collina-girard and georgeos díaz-montexano , for instance , each claim the other's hypothesis is pseudoscience .
) many of the proposed sites share some of the characteristics of the atlantis story ( water , catastrophic end , relevant time period ) , but none has been demonstrated to be a true historical atlantis .
most of the historically proposed locations are in or near the mediterranean sea : islands such as sardinia , crete , santorini ( thera ) , sicily , cyprus , and malta ; land-based cities or states such as troy , tartessos , and tantalis ( in the province of manisa , turkey ) ; israel-sinai or canaan ; and northwestern africa .
the thera eruption , dated to the seventeenth or sixteenth century bc , caused a large tsunami that some experts hypothesize devastated the minoan civilization on the nearby island of crete , further leading some to believe that this may have been the catastrophe that inspired the story .
in the area of the black sea the following locations have been proposed : bosporus and ancomah ( a legendary place near trabzon ) .
others have noted that , before the sixth century bc , the mountains on either side of the gulf of laconia were called the " pillars of hercules " , and they could be the geographical location being described in ancient reports upon which plato was basing his story .
the mountains stood at either side of the southernmost gulf in greece , the largest in the peloponnese , and that gulf opens onto the mediterranean sea .
if from the beginning of discussions , misinterpretation of gibraltar as the location rather than being at the gulf of laconia , would lend itself to many erroneous concepts regarding the location of atlantis .
plato may have not been aware of the difference .
the laconian pillars open to the south toward crete and beyond which is egypt .
the thera eruption and the late bronze age collapse affected that area and might have been the devastation to which the sources used by plato referred .
significant events such as these would have been likely material for tales passed from one generation to another for almost a thousand years .
the location of atlantis in the atlantic ocean has a certain appeal given the closely related names .
popular culture often places atlantis there , perpetuating the original platonic setting as they understand it .
the canary islands and madeira islands have been identified as a possible location , west of the straits of gibraltar , but in relative proximity to the mediterranean sea .
detailed studies of their geomorphology and geology have demonstrated , however , that they have been steadily uplifted , without any significant periods of subsidence , over the last four million years , by geologic processes such as erosional unloading , gravitational unloading , lithospheric flexure induced by adjacent islands , and volcanic underplating .
various islands or island groups in the atlantic were also identified as possible locations , notably the azores .
similarly , cores of sediment covering the ocean bottom surrounding the azores and other evidence demonstrate that it has been an undersea plateau for millions of years .
the submerged island of spartel near the strait of gibraltar has also been suggested .
several hypotheses place the sunken island in northern europe , including doggerland in the north sea , and sweden ( by olof rudbeck in " atland " , 1672–1702 ) .
doggerland , as well as viking bergen island , is thought to have been flooded by a megatsunami following the storegga slide of c .
*num* bc .
some have proposed the celtic shelf as a possible location , and that there is a link to ireland .
in *num* , a team , working on a documentary for the national geographic channel , led by professor richard freund from the university of hartford , claimed to have found possible evidence of atlantis in southwestern andalusia .
the team identified its possible location within the marshlands of the doñana national park , in the area that once was the lacus ligustinus , between the huelva , cádiz , and seville provinces , and they speculated that atlantis had been destroyed by a tsunami , extrapolating results from a previous study by spanish researchers , published four years earlier .
spanish scientists have dismissed freund's speculations , claiming that he sensationalised their work .
the anthropologist juan villarías-robles , who works with the spanish national research council , said , " richard freund was a newcomer to our project and appeared to be involved in his own very controversial issue concerning king solomon's search for ivory and gold in tartessos , the well documented settlement in the doñana area established in the first millennium bc " , and described freund's claims as " fanciful " .
a similar theory had previously been put forward by a german researcher , rainer w .
kühne , that is based only on satellite imagery and places atlantis in the marismas de hinojos , north of the city of cádiz .
before that , the historian adolf schulten had stated in the 1920s that plato had used tartessos as the basis for his atlantis myth .
several writers have speculated that antarctica is the site of atlantis , while others have proposed caribbean locations such as the alleged cuban sunken city off the guanahacabibes peninsula in cuba , the bahamas , and the bermuda triangle .
areas in the pacific and indian oceans have also been proposed including indonesia ( i .
e .
sundaland ) .
the stories of a lost continent off the coast of india , named " kumari kandam , " have inspired some to draw parallels to atlantis .
in order to give his account of atlantis verisimilitude , plato mentions that the story was heard by solon in egypt , and transmitted orally over several generations through the family of dropides , until it reached critias , a dialogue speaker in " timaeus " and " critias " .
solon had supposedly tried to adapt the atlantis oral tradition into a poem ( that if published , was to be greater than the works of hesiod and homer ) .
while it was never completed , solon passed on the story to dropides .
modern classicists deny the existence of solon's atlantis poem and the story as an oral tradition .
instead , plato is thought to be the sole inventor or fabricator .
hellanicus of lesbos used the word " atlantis " as the title for a poem published before plato , a fragment of which may be oxyrhynchus papyrus *num* , *num* .
this work only describes the atlantides ( the daughters of atlas ) , however , and has no relation to plato's atlantis account .
in the new era , the third century ad neoplatonist zoticus wrote an epic poem based on plato's account of atlantis .
plato's work may already have inspired parodic imitation , however .
writing only a few decades after the " timaeus " and " critias " , the historian theopompus of chios wrote of a land beyond the ocean known as meropis .
this description was included in book *num* of his " philippica " , which contains a dialogue between silenus and king midas .
silenus describes the meropids , a race of men who grow to twice normal size , and inhabit two cities on the island of meropis : " eusebes " ( , " pious-town " ) and " machimos " ( , " fighting-town " ) .
he also reports that an army of ten million soldiers crossed the ocean to conquer hyperborea , but abandoned this proposal when they realized that the hyperboreans were the luckiest people on earth .
heinz-günther nesselrath has argued that these and other details of silenus ' story are meant as imitation and exaggeration of the atlantis story , by parody , for the purpose of exposing plato's ideas to ridicule .
the creation of utopian and dystopian fictions was renewed after the renaissance , most notably in francis bacon's " new atlantis " ( *num* ) , the description of an ideal society that he located off the western coast of america .
thomas heyrick ( 1649-1694 ) followed him with " the new atlantis " ( *num* ) , a satirical poem in three parts .
his new continent of uncertain location , perhaps even a floating island either in the sea or the sky , serves as background for his exposure of what he described in a second edition as " a true character of popery and jesuitism " .
the title of " the new atalantis " by delarivier manley ( *num* ) , distinguished from the two others by the single letter , is an equally dystopian work but set this time on a fictional mediterranean island .
in it sexual violence and exploitation is made a metaphor for the hypocritical behaviour of politicians in their dealings with the general public .
in manley's case , the target of satire was the whig party , while in david maclean parry's " the scarlet empire " ( *num* ) it is socialism as practised in foundered atlantis .
it was followed in russia by velemir khlebnikov's poem " the fall of atlantis " ( " gibel ' atlantidy " , *num* ) , which is set in a future rationalist dystopia that has discovered the secret of immortality and is so dedicated to progress that it has lost touch with the past .
when the high priest of this ideology is tempted by a slave girl into an act of irrationality , he murders her and precipitates a second flood , above which her severed head floats vengefully among the stars .
a slightly later work , " the ancient of atlantis " ( boston , *num* ) by albert armstrong manship , expounds the atlantean wisdom that is to redeem the earth .
its three parts consist of a verse narrative of the life and training of an atlantean wise one , followed by his utopian moral teachings and then a psychic drama set in modern times in which a reincarnated child embodying the lost wisdom is reborn on earth .
in hispanic eyes , atlantis had a more intimate interpretation .
the land had been a colonial power which , although it had brought civilization to ancient europe , had also enslaved its peoples .
its tyrannical fall from grace had contributed to the fate that had overtaken it , but now its disappearance had unbalanced the world .
this was the point of view of jacint verdaguer's vast mythological epic " l'atlantida " ( *num* ) .
after the sinking of the former continent , hercules travels east across the atlantic to found the city of barcelona and then departs westward again to the hesperides .
the story is told by a hermit to a shipwrecked mariner , who is inspired to follow in his tracks and so " call the new world into existence to redress the balance of the old " .
this mariner , of course , was christopher columbus .
verdaguer's poem was written in catalan , but was widely translated in both europe and hispano-america .
one response was the similarly entitled argentinian " atlantida " of olegario victor andrade ( *num* ) , which sees in " enchanted atlantis that plato foresaw , a golden promise to the fruitful race " of latins .
the bad example of the colonising world remains , however .
jose juan tablada characterises its threat in his " de atlántida " ( *num* ) through the beguiling picture of the lost world populated by the underwater creatures of classical myth , among whom is the siren of its final stanza with there is a similar ambivalence in janus djurhuus ' six-stanza " atlantis " ( *num* ) , where a celebration of the faroese linguistic revival grants it an ancient pedigree by linking greek to norse legend .
in the poem a female figure rising from the sea against a background of classical palaces is recognised as a priestess of atlantis .
the poet recalls " that the faroes lie there in the north atlantic ocean / where before lay the poet-dreamt lands , " but also that in norse belief , such a figure only appears to those about to drown .
the fact that atlantis is a lost land has made of it a metaphor for something no longer attainable .
for the american poet edith willis linn forbes ( 1865-1945 ) , " the lost atlantis " stands for idealisation of the past ; the present moment can only be treasured once that is realised .
ella wheeler wilcox finds the location of " the lost land " ( *num* ) in one's carefree youthful past .
similarly , for the irish poet eavan boland in " atlantis , a lost sonnet " ( *num* ) , the idea was defined when " the old fable-makers searched hard for a word / to convey that what is gone is gone forever " .
for some male poets too , the idea of atlantis is constructed from what cannot be obtained .
charles bewley in his newdigate prize poem ( *num* ) thinks it grows from dissatisfaction with one's condition , in a dream of atlantis .
similarly for the australian gary catalano in a *num* prose poem , it is " a vision that sank under the weight of its own perfection " .
w .
h .
auden , however , suggests a way out of such frustration through the metaphor of journeying toward atlantis in his poem of *num* .
while travelling , he advises the one setting out , you will meet with many definitions of the goal in view , only realising at the end that the way has all the time led inward .
a few late nineteenth century verse narratives complement the genre fiction that was beginning to be written at the same period .
two of them report the disaster that overtook the continent as related by long-lived survivors .
in frederick tennyson's " atlantis " ( *num* ) an ancient greek mariner sails west and discovers an inhabited island , which is all that remains of the former kingdom .
he learns of its end and views the shattered remnant of its former glory , from which a few had escaped to set up the mediterranean civilisations .
in the second , " mona , queen of lost atlantis : an idyllic re-embodiment of long forgotten history " ( los angeles ca *num* ) by james logue dryden ( 1840-1925 ) , the story is told in a series of visions .
a seer is taken to mona's burial chamber in the ruins of atlantis , where she revives and describes the catastrophe .
there follows a survey of the lost civilisations of hyperborea and lemuria as well as atlantis , accompanied by much spiritualist lore .
william walton hoskins ( 1856-1919 ) admits to the readers of his " atlantis and other poems " ( cleveland oh , *num* ) , that he is only *num* .
its melodramatic plot concerns the poisoning of the descendant of god-born kings .
the usurping poisoner is poisoned in his turn , following which the continent is swallowed in the waves .
asian gods people the landscape of " the lost island " ( ottawa *num* ) by edward taylor fletcher ( 1816–97 ) .
an angel foresees impending catastrophe and that the people will be allowed to escape if their semi-divine rulers will sacrifice themselves .
a final example , edward n .
beecher's " the lost atlantis or the great deluge of all " ( cleveland oh , *num* ) is just a doggerel vehicle for its author's opinions : that the continent was the location of the garden of eden ; that darwin's theory of evolution is correct , as are donnelly's views .
atlantis was to become a theme in russia following the 1890s , taken up in unfinished poems by valery bryusov and konstantin balmont , as well as in a drama by the schoolgirl larisa reisner .
one other long narrative poem was published in new york by george v .
golokhvastoff .
his 250-page " the fall of atlantis " ( *num* ) records how a high priest , distressed by the prevailing degeneracy of the ruling classes , seeks to create an androgynous being from royal twins as a means to overcome this polarity .
when he is unable to control the forces unleashed by his occult ceremony , the continent is destroyed .
the spanish composer manuel de falla worked on a dramatic cantata based on verdaguer's " l'atlántida " , during the last *num* years of his life .
the name has been affixed to symphonies by janis ivanovs ( *num* ) , richard nanes , and vaclav buzek ( *num* ) .
there was also the symphonic celebration of alan hovhaness : " fanfare for the new atlantis " ( op .
*num* , *num* ) .
the bohemian-american composer and arranger vincent frank safranek wrote " atlantis ( the lost continent ) suite in four parts " ; i .

the *num* song atlantis by scottish singer donovan described atlantis and its hypothetical fate .
it charted in several countries , reaching #1 in switzerland in *num* and as high as #7 in the united states .
paintings of the submersion of atlantis are comparatively rare .
in the seventeenth century there was françois de nomé's " the fall of atlantis " , which shows a tidal wave surging toward a baroque city frontage .
the style of architecture apart , it is not very different from nicholas roerich's " the last of atlantis " of *num* .
the most dramatic depiction of the catastrophe was leon bakst's " ancient terror " ( " terror antiquus " , *num* ) , although it does not name atlantis directly .
it is a mountain-top view of a rocky bay breached by the sea , which is washing inland about the tall structures of an ancient city .
a streak of lightning crosses the upper half of the painting , while below it rises the impassive figure of an enigmatic goddess who holds a blue dove between her breasts .
vyacheslav ivanov identified the subject as atlantis in a public lecture on the painting given in *num* , the year it was first exhibited , and he has been followed by other commentators in the years since .
sculptures referencing atlantis have often been stylized single figures .
one of the earliest was einar jónsson's " the king of atlantis " ( 1919–1922 ) , now in the garden of his museum in reykjavik .
it represents a single figure , clad in a belted skirt and wearing a large triangular helmet , who sits on an ornate throne supported between two young bulls .
the walking female entitled " atlantis " ( *num* ) by ivan meštrović was from a series inspired by ancient greek figures with the symbolical meaning of unjustified suffering .
in the case of the brussels fountain feature known as " the man of atlantis " ( *num* ) by the belgian sculptor , the 4-metre tall figure wearing a diving suit steps from a plinth into the spray .
it looks light-hearted but the artist's comment on it makes a serious point : " because habitable land will be scarce , it is no longer improbable that we will return to the water in the long term .
as a result , a portion of the population will mutate into fish-like creatures .
global warming and rising water levels are practical problems for the world in general and here in the netherlands in particular " .
robert smithson's " hypothetical continent ( map of broken clear glass , atlantis ) " was first created as a photographical project on loveladies island nj in *num* , and then recreated as a gallery installation of broken glass .
on this he commented that he liked " landscapes that suggest prehistory " , and this is borne out by the original conceptual drawing of the work that includes an inset map of the continent sited off the coast of africa and at the straits into the mediterranean .
complementary dna in genetics , complementary dna ( cdna ) is dna synthesized from a single-stranded rna ( e .
g .
, messenger rna ( mrna ) or microrna ) template in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme reverse transcriptase .
cdna is often used to clone eukaryotic genes in prokaryotes .
when scientists want to express a specific protein in a cell that does not normally express that protein ( i .
e .
, heterologous expression ) , they will transfer the cdna that codes for the protein to the recipient cell .
cdna is also produced naturally by retroviruses ( such as hiv-1 , hiv-2 , simian immunodeficiency virus , etc .
) and then integrated into the host's genome , where it creates a provirus .
the term " cdna " is also used , typically in a bioinformatics context , to refer to an mrna transcript's sequence , expressed as dna bases ( gcat ) rather than rna bases ( gcau ) .
cdna is derived from mrna , so it contains only exons but no introns .
although there are several methods for doing so , cdna is most often synthesized from mature ( fully spliced ) mrna using the enzyme reverse transcriptase .
this enzyme , which naturally occurs in retroviruses , operates on a single strand of mrna , generating its complementary dna based on the pairing of rna base pairs ( a , u , g and c ) to their dna complements ( t , a , c and g , respectively ) .
to obtain eukaryotic cdna whose introns have been removed : complementary dna is often used in gene cloning or as gene probes or in the creation of a cdna library .
when scientists transfer a gene from one cell into another cell in order to express the new genetic material as a protein in the recipient cell , the cdna will be added to the recipient ( rather than the entire gene ) , because the dna for an entire gene may include dna that does not code for the protein or that interrupts the coding sequence of the protein ( e .
g .
, introns ) .
partial sequences of cdnas are often obtained as expressed sequence tags ( est ) .
with amplification of dna sequences via polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) now commonplace , one will typically conduct reverse transcription as an initial step , followed by pcr to obtain an exact sequence of cdna for intra-cellular expression .
this is achieved by designing sequence-specific dna primers that hybridize to the *num* ' and *num* ' ends of a cdna region coding for a protein .
once amplified , the sequence can be cut at each end with nucleases and inserted into one of many small circular dna sequences known as expression vectors .
such vectors allow for self-replication , inside the cells , and potentially integration in the host dna .
they typically also contain a strong promoter to drive transcription of the target cdna into mrna , which is then translated into protein .
on june *num* , *num* , the united states supreme court ruled in the case of " association for molecular pathology v .
myriad genetics " that while naturally occurring human genes cannot be patented , cdna is patent eligible because it does not occur naturally .
some viruses also use cdna to turn their viral rna into mrna ( viral rna → cdna → mrna ) .
the mrna is used to make viral proteins to take over the host cell .
an example of this first step from viral dna to cdna can be seen in the hiv cycle of infection .
here , the host cell membrane becomes attached to the virus’ lipid envelope which allows the viral capsid with two copies of viral genome rna to enter the host .
the cdna copy is then made though reverse transcription of the viral rna , a process facilitated by the chaperone cypa and a viral capsid associated reverse transcriptase .
braille braille ( ; ) is a tactile writing system used by people who are visually impaired .
it is traditionally written with embossed paper .
braille users can read computer screens and other electronic supports using refreshable braille displays .
they can write braille with the original slate and stylus or type it on a braille writer , such as a portable braille notetaker or computer that prints with a braille embosser .
braille is named after its creator , louis braille , a frenchman who lost his sight as a result of a childhood accident .
in *num* , at the age of fifteen , he developed a code for the french alphabet as an improvement on night writing .
he published his system , which subsequently included musical notation , in *num* .
the second revision , published in *num* , was the first small binary form of writing developed in the modern era .
these characters have rectangular blocks called " cells " that have tiny bumps called " raised dots " .
the number and arrangement of these dots distinguish one character from another .
since the various braille alphabets originated as transcription codes for printed writing , the mappings ( sets of character designations ) vary from language to language , and even within one ; in english braille there are three levels of encoding : grade *num* – a letter-by-letter transcription used for basic literacy ; grade *num* – an addition of abbreviations and contractions ; and grade *num* – various non-standardized personal stenography .
braille cells are not the only thing to appear in braille text .
there may be embossed illustrations and graphs , with the lines either solid or made of series of dots , arrows , bullets that are larger than braille dots , etc .
a full braille cell includes six raised dots arranged in two columns , each column having three dots .
the dot positions are identified by numbers from one to six .
there are *num* possible solutions using zero or more dots .
a cell can be used to represent a letter , number , punctuation mark , or even a word .
in the face of screen reader software , braille usage has declined .
braille was based on a tactile military code called night writing , developed by charles barbier in response to napoleon's demand for a means for soldiers to communicate silently at night and without a light source .
in barbier's system , sets of *num* embossed dots encoded *num* different sounds .
it proved to be too difficult for soldiers to recognize by touch and was rejected by the military .
in *num* barbier visited the royal institute for the blind in paris , where he met louis braille .
braille identified two major defects of the code : first , by representing only sounds , the code was unable to render the orthography of the words ; second , the human finger could not encompass the whole 12-dot symbol without moving , and so could not move rapidly from one symbol to another .
braille's solution was to use 6-dot cells and to assign a specific pattern to each letter of the alphabet .
at first , braille was a one-to-one transliteration of french orthography , but soon various abbreviations , contractions , and even logograms were developed , creating a system much more like shorthand .
the expanded english system , called grade-2 braille , was complete by *num* .
for blind readers , braille is an independent writing system , rather than a code of printed orthography .
braille is derived from the latin alphabet , albeit indirectly .
in braille's original system , the dot patterns were assigned to letters according to their position within the alphabetic order of the french alphabet , with accented letters and " w " sorted at the end .
the first ten letters of the alphabet , " a–j , " use the upper four dot positions : ( black dots in the table below ) .
these stand for the ten digits " 1–9 " and " *num* " in a system parallel to hebrew gematria and greek isopsephy .
( though the dots are assigned in no obvious order , the cells with the fewest dots are assigned to the first three letters ( and lowest digits ) , " abc = *num* " ( ) , and to the three vowels in this part of the alphabet , " aei " ( ) , whereas the even digits , " *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* " ( ) , are corners / right angles .
) the next ten letters , " k–t , " are identical to " a–j , " respectively , apart from the addition of a dot at position *num* ( red dots in the table ) : : the next ten letters ( the next " decade " ) are the same again , but with dots also at positions both *num* and *num* ( green dots ) .
here " w " was left out as not being a part of the official french alphabet at the time of braille's life ; the french braille order is " u v x y z ç é à è ù " ( ) .
the next ten , ending in " w " , are the same again , except that for this series position *num* ( purple dot ) is used without position *num* .
the " a–j " series lowered by one dot space ( ) are used for punctuation .
letters " a " and " c " , which only use dots in the top row , were lowered two places for the apostrophe and hyphen : .
( these are the decade diacritics , at left in the table below , of the second and third decade .
) in addition , there are ten patterns that are based on the first two letters ( ) shifted to the right ; these were assigned to non-french letters ( " ì ä ò " ) , or serve non-letter functions : ( superscript ; in english the accent mark ) , ( currency prefix ) , ( capital , in english the decimal point ) , ( number sign ) , ( emphasis mark ) , ( symbol prefix ) .
originally there had been nine decades .
the fifth through ninth used dashes as well as dots , but proved to be impractical and were soon abandoned .
these could be replaced with what we now know as the number sign ( ) , though that only caught on for the digits ( old *ord* decade → modern *ord* decade ) .
the dash occupying the top row of the original sixth decade was simply dropped , producing the modern fifth decade .
( see *num* braille .
) historically , there have been three principles in assigning the values of a linear script ( print ) to braille : using louis braille's original french letter values ; reassigning the braille letters according to the sort order of the print alphabet being transcribed ; and reassigning the letters to improve the efficiency of writing in braille .
under international consensus , most braille alphabets follow the french sorting order for the *num* letters of the basic latin alphabet , and there have been attempts at unifying the letters beyond these *num* ( see international braille ) , though differences remain , for example in german braille and the contractions of english braille .
this unification avoids the chaos of each nation reordering the braille code to match the sorting order of its print alphabet , as happened in algerian braille , where braille codes were numerically reassigned to match the order of the arabic alphabet and bear little relation to the values used in other countries ( compare modern arabic braille , which uses the french sorting order ) , and as happened in an early american version of english braille , where the letters " w , x , y , z " were reassigned to match english alphabetical order .
a convention sometimes seen for letters beyond the basic *num* is to exploit the physical symmetry of braille patterns iconically , for example , by assigning a reversed " n " to " ñ " or an inverted " s " to " sh " .
( see hungarian braille and bharati braille , which do this to some extent .
) a third principle was to assign braille codes according to frequency , with the simplest patterns ( quickest ones to write with a stylus ) assigned to the most frequent letters of the alphabet .
such frequency-based alphabets were used in germany and the united states in the *ord* century ( see american braille ) , but with the invention of the braille typewriter their advantage disappeared , and none are attested in modern use – they had the disadvantage that the resulting small number of dots in a text interfered with following the alignment of the letters , and consequently made texts more difficult to read than braille's more arbitrary letter-assignment .
finally , there are braille scripts which don't order the codes numerically at all , such as japanese braille and korean braille , which are based on more abstract principles of syllable composition .
academic texts are sometimes written in a script of eight dots per cell rather than six , enabling them to encode a greater number of symbols .
( see gardner–salinas braille codes .
) luxembourgish braille has adopted eight-dot cells for general use ; for example , it adds a dot below each letter to derive its capital variant .
braille was the first writing system with binary encoding .
the system as devised by braille consists of two parts : within an individual cell , the dot positions are arranged in two columns of three positions .
a raised dot can appear in any of the six positions , producing sixty-four ( *num* ) possible patterns , including one in which there are no raised dots .
for reference purposes , a pattern is commonly described by listing the positions where dots are raised , the positions being universally numbered , from top to bottom , as *num* to *num* on the left and *num* to *num* on the right .
for example , dot pattern 1-3-4 describe a cell with three dots raised , at the top and bottom in the left column and at the top of the right column : that is , the letter " m " .
the lines of horizontal braille text are separated by a space , much like visible printed text , so that the dots of one line can be differentiated from the braille text above and below .
different assignments of braille codes ( or code pages ) are used to map the character sets of different printed scripts to the six-bit cells .
braille assignments have also been created for mathematical and musical notation .
however , because the six-dot braille cell allows only *num* ( *num* ) patterns , including space , the characters of a braille script commonly have multiple values , depending on their context .
that is , character mapping between print and braille is not one-to-one .
for example , the character corresponds in print to both the letter " d " and the digit " *num* " .
in addition to simple encoding , many braille alphabets use contractions to reduce the size of braille texts and to increase reading speed .
( see contracted braille ) braille may be produced by hand using a slate and stylus in which each dot is created from the back of the page , writing in mirror image , or it may be produced on a braille typewriter or perkins brailler , or an electronic brailler or ebrailler .
because braille letters cannot be effectively erased and written over if an error is made , an error is overwritten with all six dots ( ) .
" interpoint " refers to braille printing that is offset , so that the paper can be embossed on both sides , with the dots on one side appearing between the divots that form the dots on the other ( see the photo in the box at the top of this article for an example ) .
using a computer or other electronic device , braille may be produced with a braille embosser ( printer ) or a refreshable braille display ( screen ) .
braille has been extended to an 8-dot code , particularly for use with braille embossers and refreshable braille displays .
in 8-dot braille the additional dots are added at the bottom of the cell , giving a matrix *num* dots high by *num* dots wide .
the additional dots are given the numbers *num* ( for the lower-left dot ) and *num* ( for the lower-right dot ) .
eight-dot braille has the advantages that the case of an individual letter is directly coded in the cell containing the letter and that all the printable ascii characters can be represented in a single cell .
all *num* ( *num* ) possible combinations of *num* dots are encoded by the unicode standard .
braille with six dots is frequently stored as braille ascii .
the first *num* braille letters , up through the first half of the *ord* decade , transcribe " a–z " ( skipping " w " ) .
in english braille , the rest of that decade is rounded out with the ligatures " and , for , of , the , " and " with " .
omitting dot *num* from these forms the *ord* decade , the ligatures " ch , gh , sh , th , wh , ed , er , ou , ow " and the letter " w " .
various formatting marks affect the values of the letters that follow them .
they have no direct equivalent in print .
the most important in english braille are : that is , is read as capital ' a ' , and as the digit ' *num* ' .
basic punctuation marks in english braille include : punctuation varies from language to language .
for example , french braille uses for its question mark and swaps the quotation marks and parentheses ( to and ) ; it uses the period ( ) for the decimal point , as in print , and the decimal point ( ) to mark capitalization .
braille contractions are words and affixes that are shortened so that they take up fewer cells .
in english braille , for example , the word " afternoon " is written with just three letters , , much like stenoscript .
there are also several abbreviation marks that create what are effectively logograms .
the most common of these is dot *num* , which combines with the first letter of words .
with the letter " m " , the resulting word is " mother " .
there are also ligatures ( " contracted " letters ) , which are single letters in braille but correspond to more than one letter in print .
the letter " and " , for example , is used to write words with the sequence " a-n-d " in them , such as " hand " .
most braille embossers support between *num* and *num* cells per line , and *num* lines per page .
a manually operated perkins braille typewriter supports a maximum of *num* cells per line ( its margins are adjustable ) , and typical paper allows *num* lines per page .
a large interlining stainsby has *num* cells per line and *num* lines per page .
an a4-sized marburg braille frame , which allows interpoint braille ( dots on both sides of the page , offset so they do not interfere with each other ) has *num* cells per line and *num* lines per page .
a braille writing machine is a typewriter with six keys that allow to write in braille alphabet on a regular white page .
the first braille typewriter to gain general acceptance was invented by frank haven hall ( superintendent of the illinois school for the blind ) , and was presented to the public in *num* .
in *num* david abraham , a woodworking teacher at the perkins school for the blind produced a more advanced braille typewriter , the perkins brailler .
in *num* ernest bate developed the mountbatten brailler , an electronic machine used to type braille on braille paper , giving it a number of additional features such as word processing , audio feedback and embossing .
this version was improved in *num* with a quiet writer that had an erase key .
braille printers or embosser were produced in 1950s .
in *num* robert mann , a teacher in mit , wrote dotsys , a software that allowed automatic braille translation , and another group created an embossing device called " m .
i .
t .
braillemboss .
" .
the mitre corporation team of robert gildea , jonathan millen , reid gerhart and joseph sullivan ( now president of duxbury systems ) developed dotsys iii , the first braille translator written in a portable programming language .
dotsys iii was developed for the atlanta public schools as a public domain program .
in *num* david s .
morgan produced the first smart brailler machine , with added text to speech function and allowed digital capture of data entered .
braille is usually read in printed forms such on paper books written in braille , braille public signals and also on braille e-books .
currently more than *num* % of all printed books have been translated into braille .
children who are blind not only have the education disadvantage of not being able to see – they also miss out on fundamental parts of early and advanced education if not provided with the necessary tools .
children who are blind or visually impaired can begin learning pre-braille skills from a very young age to become fluent braille readers as they get older .
in *num* , *num* % of legally blind , school-age children were able to read braille in the u .
s .
according to the *num* " annual report " from the american printing house for the blind , there were *num* , *num* legally blind students registered in the u .
s .
of these , *num* .
*num* % ( *num* , *num* ) were registered as braille readers , *num* % ( *num* , *num* ) as visual readers , *num* .
*num* % ( *num* , *num* ) as auditory readers , *num* % ( *num* , *num* ) as pre-readers , and *num* % ( *num* , *num* ) as non-readers .
there are numerous causes for the decline in braille usage , including school budget constraints , technology advancement , and different philosophical views over how blind children should be educated .
a key turning point for braille literacy was the passage of the rehabilitation act of *num* , an act of congress that moved thousands of children from specialized schools for the blind into mainstream public schools .
because only a small percentage of public schools could afford to train and hire braille-qualified teachers , braille literacy has declined since the law took effect .
braille literacy rates have improved slightly since the bill was passed , in part because of pressure from consumers and advocacy groups that has led *num* states to pass legislation mandating that children who are legally blind be given the opportunity to learn braille .
in *num* there were *num* , *num* legally blind students registered in the united states , but only *num* % ( *num* , *num* ) of them used braille as their primary reading medium .
early braille education is crucial to literacy for a blind or low-vision child .
a study conducted in the state of washington found that people who learned braille at an early age did just as well , if not better than their sighted peers in several areas , including vocabulary and comprehension .
in the preliminary adult study , while evaluating the correlation between adult literacy skills and employment , it was found that *num* % of the participants who had learned to read in braille were unemployed , compared to the *num* % unemployment rate of those who had learned to read using print .
currently , among the estimated *num* , *num* blind adults in the united states , *num* % of those who are braille-literate are employed .
among adults who do not know braille , only *num* % are employed .
statistically , history has proven that braille reading proficiency provides an essential skill set that allows blind or low-vision children to compete with their sighted peers in a school environment and later in life as they enter the workforce .
though braille is thought to be the main way blind people read and write , in britain ( for example ) out of the reported two million blind and low vision population , it is estimated that only around 15–20 , *num* people use braille .
younger people are turning to electronic text on computers with screen reader software instead , a more portable communication method that they can use with their friends .
a debate has started on how to make braille more attractive and for more teachers to be available to teach it .
although it is possible to transcribe print by simply substituting the equivalent braille character for its printed equivalent , in english such a character-by-character transcription ( known as " uncontracted braille " ) is only used by beginners .
braille characters are much larger than their printed equivalents , and the standard *num* " by *num* .
*num* " ( *num* cm × *num* cm ) page has room for only *num* lines of *num* characters .
to reduce space and increase reading speed , most braille alphabets and orthographies use ligatures , abbreviations , and contractions .
virtually all english braille books are transcribed in this " contracted braille , " which adds an additional layer of complexity to english orthography : the library of congress's " instruction manual for braille transcribing " runs to over *num* pages and braille transcribers must pass certification tests .
fully contracted braille is known as " grade *num* braille " .
there is an intermediate form between computer braille—one-for-one identity with print—and grade *num* , which is called grade *num* braille .
in grade *num* , the capital sign and number sign are used , and most punctuation marks are shown using their grade *num* values .
the system of contractions in english braille begins with a set of *num* words which are contracted to single characters .
thus the word " but " is contracted to the single letter " b , " " can " to " c " , " do " to " d " , and so on .
even this simple rule creates issues requiring special cases ; for example , " d " is , specifically , an abbreviation of the verb " do ; " the noun " do " representing the note of the musical scale is a different word , and must be spelled out .
portions of words may be contracted , and many rules govern this process .
for example , the character with dots 2-3-5 ( the letter " f " lowered in the braille cell ) stands for " ff " when used in the middle of a word .
at the beginning of a word , this same character stands for the word " to " ; the character is written in braille with no space following it .
( this contraction was removed in the unified english braille code .
) at the end of a word , the same character represents an exclamation point .
some contractions are more similar than their print equivalents .
for example , the contraction , meaning ' letter ' , differs from , meaning ' little ' , only in adding one dot to the second : " little " , " letter " .
this causes greater confusion between the braille spellings of these words and can hinder the learning process of contracted braille .
the contraction rules take into account the linguistic structure of the word ; thus , contractions are generally not to be used when their use would alter the usual braille form of a base word to which a prefix or suffix has been added .
some portions of the transcription rules are not fully codified and rely on the judgment of the transcriber .
thus , when the contraction rules permit the same word in more than one way , preference is given to " the contraction that more nearly approximates correct pronunciation .
" "grade *num* braille " is a variety of non-standardized systems that include many additional shorthand-like contractions .
they are not used for publication , but by individuals for their personal convenience .
when people produce braille , this is called braille transcription .
when computer software produces braille , this is called braille translation .
braille translation software exists to handle most of the common languages of the world , and many technical areas , such as mathematics ( mathematical notation ) , for example wimats , music ( musical notation ) , and tactile graphics .
since braille is one of the few writing systems where tactile perception is used , as opposed to visual perception , a braille reader must develop new skills .
one skill important for braille readers is the ability to create smooth and even pressures when running one's fingers along the words .
there are many different styles and techniques used for the understanding and development of braille , even though a study by b .
f .
holland suggests that there is no specific technique that is superior to any other .
another study by lowenfield & abel shows that braille could be read " the fastest and best .
.
.
by students who read using the index fingers of both hands " .
another important reading skill emphasized in this study is to finish reading the end of a line with the right hand and to find the beginning of the next line with the left hand simultaneously .
one final conclusion drawn by both lowenfield and abel is that children have difficulty using both hands independently where the right hand is the dominant hand .
but this hand preference does not correlate to other activities .
when braille was first adapted to languages other than french , many schemes were adopted , including mapping the native alphabet to the alphabetical order of french – e .
g .
in english w , which was not in the french alphabet at the time , is mapped to braille x , x to y , y to z , and z to the first french-accented letter – or completely rearranging the alphabet such that common letters are represented by the simplest braille patterns .
consequently , mutual intelligibility was greatly hindered by this state of affairs .
in *num* , the international congress on work for the blind , held in paris , proposed an international braille standard , where braille codes for different languages and scripts would be based , not on the order of a particular alphabet , but on phonetic correspondence and transliteration to latin .
this unified braille has been applied to the languages of india and africa , arabic , vietnamese , hebrew , russian , and armenian , as well as nearly all latin-script languages .
greek , for example , " gamma " is written as latin " g " , despite the fact that it has the alphabetic position of " c " ; hebrew " bet " , the second letter of the alphabet and cognate with the latin letter " b " , is sometimes pronounced / b / and sometimes / v / , and is written " b " or " v " accordingly ; russian " ts " is written as " c " , which is the usual letter for / ts / in those slavic languages that use the latin alphabet ; and arabic " f " is written as " f " , despite being historically " p " , and occurring in that part of the arabic alphabet ( between historic " o " and " q " ) .
other systems for assigning values to braille patterns are also followed beside the simple mapping of the alphabetical order onto the original french order .
some braille alphabets start with unified braille , and then diverge significantly based on the phonology of the target languages , while others diverge even further .
in the various chinese systems , traditional braille values are used for initial consonants and the simple vowels .
in both mandarin and cantonese braille , however , characters have different readings depending on whether they are placed in syllable-initial ( onset ) or syllable-final ( rime ) position .
for instance , the cell for latin " k " , , represents cantonese " k " ( " g " in yale and other modern romanizations ) when initial , but " aak " when final , while latin " j " , , represents cantonese initial " j " but final " oei " .
novel systems of braille mapping include korean , which adopts separate syllable-initial and syllable-final forms for its consonants , explicitly grouping braille cells into syllabic groups in the same way as hangul .
japanese , meanwhile , combines independent vowel dot patterns and modifier consonant dot patterns into a single braille cell – an abugida representation of each japanese mora .
the current series of canadian banknotes has a tactile feature consisting of raised dots that indicate the denomination , allowing bills to be easily identified by blind or low vision people .
it does not use standard braille ; rather , the feature uses a system developed in consultation with blind and low vision canadians after research indicated that braille was not sufficiently robust and that not all potential users read braille .
mexican bank notes , australian bank notes , indian rupee notes , israeli new shekel notes and russian ruble notes also have special raised symbols to make them identifiable by persons who are blind or low vision .
in india there are instances where the parliament acts have been published in braille , such as " the right to information act " .
in the united states , the americans with disabilities act of *num* requires various building signage to be in braille .
in the united kingdom , it is required that medicines have the name of the medicine in braille on the labeling .
australia also recently introduced the tactile feature onto their five-dollar banknote u .
k .
september *num* – on the front of the £10 polymer note ( the side with raised print ) , there are two clusters of raised dots in the top left hand corner .
this tactile feature helps blind and partially sighted people identify the value of the note .
braille was added to the unicode standard in september *num* with the release of version *num* .
*num* .
most braille embossers and refreshable braille displays do not support unicode , using instead 6-dot braille ascii .
some embossers have proprietary control codes for 8-dot braille or for full graphics mode , where dots may be placed anywhere on the page without leaving any space between braille cells so that continuous lines can be drawn in diagrams , but these are rarely used and are not standard .
the unicode standard encodes 8-dot braille glyphs according to their binary appearance , rather than following their assigned numeric order .
dot *num* corresponds to the least significant bit of the low byte of the unicode scalar value , and dot *num* to the high bit of that byte .
the unicode block for braille is u+2800 .

andrey markov andrey andreyevich markov ( *num* – *num* ) was a russian mathematician best known for his work on stochastic processes .
a primary subject of his research later became known as markov chains and markov processes .
markov and his younger brother vladimir andreevich markov ( 1871–1897 ) proved the markov brothers ' inequality .
his son , another andrei andreevich markov ( 1903–1979 ) , was also a notable mathematician , making contributions to constructive mathematics and recursive function theory .
andrey markov was born on *num* june *num* in russia .
he attended petersburg grammar , where he was seen as a rebellious student by a select few teachers .
in his academics he performed poorly in most subjects other than mathematics .
later in life he attended petersburg university and was lectured by pafnuty chebyshev .
among his teachers were yulian sokhotski ( differential calculus , higher algebra ) , konstantin posse ( analytic geometry ) , yegor zolotarev ( integral calculus ) , pafnuty chebyshev ( number theory and probability theory ) , aleksandr korkin ( ordinary and partial differential equations ) , mikhail okatov ( mechanism theory ) , osip somov ( mechanics ) , and nikolai budaev ( descriptive and higher geometry ) .
he completed his studies at the university and was later asked if he would like to stay and have a career as a mathematician .
he later taught at high schools and continued his own mathematical studies .
in this time he found a practical use for his mathematical skills .
he figured out that he could use chains to model the alliteration of vowels and consonants in russian literature .
he also contributed to many other mathematical aspects in his time .
he died at age *num* on *num* july *num* .
in *num* , markov was awarded a gold medal for his outstanding solution of the problem "about integration of differential equations by continued fractions with an application to the equation " formula_1 .
during the following year , he passed the candidate's examinations , and he remained at the university to prepare for a lecturer's position .
in april *num* , markov defended his master's thesis " on the binary square forms with positive determinant " , which was encouraged by aleksandr korkin and yegor zolotarev .
four years later in *num* , he defended his doctoral thesis titled " on certain applications of the algebraic continuous fractions " .
his pedagogical work began after the defense of his master's thesis in autumn *num* .
as a privatdozent he lectured on differential and integral calculus .
later he lectured alternately on " introduction to analysis " , probability theory ( succeeding chebyshev , who had left the university in *num* ) and the calculus of differences .
from *num* through *num* he also lectured in differential calculus .
one year after the defense of his doctoral thesis , markov was appointed extraordinary professor ( *num* ) and in the same year he was elected adjunct to the academy of sciences .
in *num* , after the death of viktor bunyakovsky , markov became an extraordinary member of the academy .
his promotion to an ordinary professor of st .
petersburg university followed in the fall of *num* .
in *num* , markov was elected an ordinary member of the academy as the successor of chebyshev .
in *num* , he was appointed merited professor and was granted the right to retire , which he did immediately .
until *num* , however , he continued to lecture in the calculus of differences .
in connection with student riots in *num* , professors and lecturers of st .
petersburg university were ordered to monitor their students .
markov refused to accept this decree , and he wrote an explanation in which he declined to be an " agent of the governance " .
markov was removed from further teaching duties at st .
petersburg university , and hence he decided to retire from the university .
markov was an atheist .
in *num* he protested leo tolstoy's excommunication from the russian orthodox church by requesting his own excommunication .
the church complied with his request .
in *num* , the council of st .
petersburg elected nine scientists honorary members of the university .
markov was among them , but his election was not affirmed by the minister of education .
the affirmation only occurred four years later , after the february revolution in *num* .
markov then resumed his teaching activities and lectured on probability theory and the calculus of differences until his death in *num* .
christopher columbus christopher columbus ( ; before *num* october *num* may *num* ) was an italian explorer , navigator , and colonist who completed four voyages across the atlantic ocean under the auspices of the catholic monarchs of spain .
he led the first european expeditions to the caribbean , central america , and south america , initiating the permanent european colonization of the americas .
columbus discovered the viable sailing route to the americas , a continent which was not then known to the old world .
while what he thought he had discovered was a route to the far east , he is credited with the opening of the americas for conquest and settlement by europeans .
columbus's early life is somewhat obscure , but scholars generally agree that he was born in the republic of genoa and spoke a dialect of ligurian as his first language .
he went to sea at a young age and travelled widely , as far north as the british isles ( and possibly iceland ) and as far south as what is now ghana .
he married a portuguese woman and was based in lisbon for several years , but later took a spanish mistress ; he had one son with each woman .
though largely self-educated , columbus was widely read in geography , astronomy , and history .
he formulated a plan to seek a western sea passage to the east indies , hoping to profit from the lucrative spice trade .
after years of lobbying , the catholic monarchs of spain agreed to sponsor a journey west , in the name of the crown of castile .
columbus left spain in august *num* with three ships , and after a stopover in the canary islands made landfall in the americas on *num* october ( now celebrated as columbus day ) .
his landing place was an island in the bahamas , known by its native inhabitants as guanahani ; its exact location is uncertain .
columbus subsequently visited cuba and hispaniola , establishing a colony in what is now haiti—the first european settlement in the americas since the norse colonies almost *num* years earlier .
he arrived back in spain in early *num* , bringing a number of captive natives with him .
word of his discoveries soon spread throughout europe .
columbus would make three further voyages to the new world , exploring the lesser antilles in *num* , trinidad and the northern coast of south america in *num* , and the eastern coast of central america in *num* .
many of the names he gave to geographical features—particularly islands—are still in use .
he continued to seek a passage to the east indies , and the extent to which he was aware that the americas were a wholly separate landmass is uncertain ; he gave the name " indios " ( " indians " ) to the indigenous peoples he encountered .
columbus's strained relationship with the spanish crown and its appointed colonial administrators in america led to his arrest and removal from hispaniola in *num* , and later to protracted litigation over the benefits that he and his heirs claimed were owed to them by the crown .
columbus's expeditions inaugurated a period of exploration , conquest , and colonization that lasted for centuries , helping create the modern western world .
the transfers between the old world and new world that followed his first voyage are known as the columbian exchange , and the period of human habitation in the americas prior to his arrival is known as the pre-columbian era .
columbus's legacy continues to be debated .
he was widely venerated in the centuries after his death , but public perceptions have changed as recent scholars have given attention to negative aspects of his life , such as his role in the extinction of the taíno people , his promotion of slavery , and allegations of tyranny towards spanish colonists .
many landmarks and institutions in the western hemisphere bear his name , including the country of colombia .
the name " christopher columbus " is the anglicisation of the latin christophorus columbus .
his name in ligurian is cristòffa cómbo , in italian cristoforo colombo and in spanish cristóbal colón .
he was born before *num* october *num* in the territory of the republic of genoa ( now part of modern italy ) , though the exact location remains disputed .
his father was domenico colombo , a middle-class wool weaver who worked both in genoa and savona and who also owned a cheese stand at which young christopher worked as a helper .
his mother was susanna fontanarossa .
bartolomeo , giovanni pellegrino , and giacomo were his brothers .
bartolomeo worked in a cartography workshop in lisbon for at least part of his adulthood .
he also had a sister named bianchinetta .
columbus never wrote in his native language , which is presumed to have been a genoese variety of ligurian ( his name would translate in the 16th-century genoese language as " christoffa " " corombo " ) .
in one of his writings , he says he went to sea at the age of *num* .
in *num* , the columbus family moved to savona , where domenico took over a tavern .
in the same year , christopher was on a genoese ship hired in the service of rené of anjou to support his attempt to conquer the kingdom of naples .
some modern historians have argued that he was not from genoa but , instead , from the aragon region of spain or from portugal .
these competing hypotheses have generally been discounted by mainstream scholars .
in *num* , columbus began his apprenticeship as business agent for the important centurione , di negro and spinola families of genoa .
later , he allegedly made a trip to chios , an aegean island then ruled by genoa .
in may *num* , he took part in an armed convoy sent by genoa to carry valuable cargo to northern europe .
he docked in bristol , england and galway , ireland .
in *num* , he was possibly in iceland .
in the autumn of *num* , he sailed on a portuguese ship from galway to lisbon , where he found his brother bartolomeo , and they continued trading for the centurione family .
columbus based himself in lisbon from *num* to *num* .
he married filipa moniz perestrelo , daughter of the porto santo governor and portuguese nobleman of lombard origin bartolomeu perestrello .
in *num* or *num* , his son diego columbus was born .
between *num* and *num* , columbus traded along the coasts of west africa , reaching the portuguese trading post of elmina at the guinea coast ( in present-day ghana ) .
some records report that filipa died sometime around *num* , while columbus was away in castile .
he returned to portugal to settle her estate and take his son diego with him .
he had left portugal for castile in *num* , where he found a mistress in *num* , a 20-year-old orphan named beatriz enríquez de arana .
it is likely that beatriz met columbus when he was in córdoba , a gathering site of many genoese merchants and where the court of the catholic monarchs was located at intervals .
beatriz , unmarried at the time , gave birth to columbus's natural son fernando columbus in july *num* , named for the monarch of aragón .
columbus recognized the boy as his offspring .
columbus entrusted his older , legitimate son diego to take care of beatriz and pay the pension set aside for her following his death , but diego was negligent in his duties .
ambitious , columbus eventually learned latin , portuguese , and castilian .
he read widely about astronomy , geography , and history , including the works of claudius ptolemy , cardinal pierre d'ailly's " imago mundi " , the travels of marco polo and sir john mandeville , pliny's " natural history " , and pope pius ii's " historia rerum ubique gestarum " .
according to historian edmund morgan , throughout his life , columbus also showed a keen interest in the bible and in biblical prophecies , often quoting biblical texts in his letters and logs .
for example , part of the argument that he submitted to the spanish catholic monarchs when he sought their support for his proposed expedition to reach the indies by sailing west was based on his reading of the second book of esdras ( ezra ) : see , which he took to mean that the earth is made of six parts of land to one of water .
towards the end of his life , he produced a " book of prophecies " in which his career as an explorer is interpreted in the light of christian eschatology and of apocalypticism .
under the mongol empire's hegemony over asia ( the " pax mongolica " , or " mongol peace " ) , europeans had long enjoyed a safe land passage , the silk road , to the indies ( then construed roughly as all of south and east asia ) and china , which were sources of valuable goods such as spices and silk .
with the fall of constantinople to the ottoman turks in *num* , the land route to asia became much more difficult and dangerous .
portuguese navigators tried to find a sea way to asia .
in *num* , the florentine astronomer paolo dal pozzo toscanelli suggested to king afonso v of portugal that sailing west would be a quicker way to reach the spice islands , cathay , and cipangu than the route around africa .
afonso rejected his proposal .
portuguese explorers , under the leadership of king john ii , then developed the cape route to asia around africa .
major progress in this quest was achieved in *num* , when bartolomeu dias reached the cape of good hope , in what is now south africa .
meanwhile , in the 1480s , the columbus brothers had picked up toscanelli's suggestion and proposed a plan to reach the indies by sailing west across the " ocean sea " , i .
e .
, the atlantic .
however , dias's discovery had shifted the interests of portuguese seafaring to the southeast passage , which complicated columbus's proposals significantly .
washington irving's *num* biography of columbus popularized the idea that columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because many catholic theologians insisted that the earth was flat .
in fact , nearly all educated westerners had understood , at least since the time of aristotle , that the earth is spherical .
the sphericity of the earth is also accounted for in the work of ptolemy , on which medieval astronomy was largely based .
christian writers whose works clearly reflect the conviction that the earth is spherical include saint bede the venerable in his " reckoning of time " , written around ad *num* .
in columbus's time , the techniques of celestial navigation , which use the position of the sun and the stars in the sky , together with the understanding that the earth is a sphere , had long been in use by astronomers and were beginning to be implemented by mariners .
as far back as the *ord* century bc , eratosthenes had correctly computed the circumference of the earth by using simple geometry and studying the shadows cast by objects at two remote locations .
in the *ord* century bc , posidonius confirmed eratosthenes's results by comparing stellar observations at two separate locations .
these measurements were widely known among scholars , but confusion about the old-fashioned units of distance in which they were expressed led to some debate about the size of the earth .
from d'ailly's " imago mundi " columbus learned of alfraganus's estimate that a degree of latitude ( or a degree of longitude along the equator ) spanned *num* miles , but did not realize that this was expressed in the arabic mile rather than the shorter roman mile with which he was familiar ( *num* , *num* m ) .
he therefore estimated the circumference of the earth to be about *num* , *num* km , whereas the correct value is .
furthermore , most scholars accepted ptolemy's estimate that eurasia spanned 180° longitude , rather than the actual 130° ( to the chinese mainland ) or 150° ( to japan at the latitude of spain ) .
columbus , for his part , believed the even higher estimate of marinus of tyre , which put the longitudinal span of the eurasian landmass at 225° , leaving only 135° of water .
he also believed that japan ( which he called " cipangu " , following marco polo ) was much larger , farther to the east from china ( " cathay " ) , and closer to the equator than it is , and that there were inhabited islands even farther to the east than japan , including the mythical antillia , which he thought might lie not much farther to the west than the azores .
in this , he was influenced by the ideas of florentine astronomer , paolo dal pozzo toscanelli , who corresponded with columbus in *num* and who also defended the feasibility of a westward route to asia .
columbus therefore estimated the distance from the canary islands to japan to be about *num* , *num* italian miles ( *num* , *num* km , or *num* , *num* statute miles ) .
the true figure is now known to be vastly larger : about *num* , *num* km .
no ship in the *ord* century could have carried enough food and fresh water for such a long voyage , and the dangers involved in navigating through the uncharted ocean would have been formidable .
most european navigators reasonably concluded that a westward voyage from europe to asia was unfeasible .
the catholic monarchs , however , having completed an expensive war in the iberian peninsula , were eager to obtain a competitive edge over other european countries in the quest for trade with the indies .
columbus's project , though far-fetched , held the promise of such an advantage .
though columbus was wrong about the number of degrees of longitude that separated europe from the far east and about the distance that each degree represented , he did possess valuable knowledge about the trade winds , which would prove to be the key to his successful navigation of the atlantic ocean .
during his first voyage in *num* , the brisk trade winds from the east , commonly called " easterlies " , propelled columbus's fleet for five weeks , from the canary islands to the bahamas .
the precise first land sighting and landing point was san salvador island .
to return to spain against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique , called beating , during which food and drinkable water would probably have been exhausted .
instead , columbus returned home by following the curving trade winds northeastward to the middle latitudes of the north atlantic , where he was able to catch the " westerlies " that blow eastward to the coast of western europe .
there , in turn , the winds curve southward towards the iberian peninsula .
it is unclear whether columbus learned about the winds from his own sailing experience or if he had heard about them from others .
the corresponding technique for efficient travel in the atlantic appears to have been exploited first by the portuguese , who referred to it as the " volta do mar " ( " turn of the sea " ) .
columbus's knowledge of the atlantic wind patterns was , however , imperfect at the time of his first voyage .
by sailing directly due west from the canary islands during hurricane season , skirting the so-called horse latitudes of the mid-atlantic , columbus risked either being becalmed or running into a tropical cyclone , both of which , by chance , he avoided .
in *num* , columbus presented his plans to king john ii of portugal .
he proposed that the king equip three sturdy ships and grant columbus one year's time to sail out into the atlantic , search for a western route to the orient , and return .
columbus also requested he be made " great admiral of the ocean " , appointed governor of any and all lands he discovered , and given one-tenth of all revenue from those lands .
the king submitted columbus's proposal to his experts , who rejected it .
it was their considered opinion that columbus's estimation of a travel distance of was , in fact , far too low .
in *num* , columbus again appealed to the court of portugal , resulting in john ii again inviting him for an audience .
that meeting also proved unsuccessful , in part because not long afterwards bartolomeu dias returned to portugal with news of his successful rounding of the southern tip of africa ( near the cape of good hope ) .
with an eastern sea route to asia apparently at hand , king john was no longer interested in columbus's far-fetched project .
columbus traveled from portugal to both genoa and venice , but he received encouragement from neither .
he had also dispatched his brother bartholomew to the court of henry vii of england to inquire whether the english crown might sponsor his expedition , but also without success .
columbus had sought an audience from the monarchs ferdinand ii of aragon and isabella i of castile , who had united several kingdoms in the iberian peninsula by marrying and were ruling together .
on *num* may *num* , permission having been granted , columbus presented his plans to queen isabella , who , in turn , referred it to a committee .
after the passing of much time , the savants of spain , like their counterparts in portugal , replied that columbus had grossly underestimated the distance to asia .
they pronounced the idea impractical and advised their royal highnesses to pass on the proposed venture .
however , to keep columbus from taking his ideas elsewhere , and perhaps to keep their options open , the catholic monarchs gave him an annual allowance of *num* , *num* " maravedis " and , in *num* , furnished him with a letter ordering all cities and towns under their domain to provide him food and lodging at no cost .
after continually lobbying at the spanish court and two years of negotiations , he finally had success in january *num* .
ferdinand and isabella had just conquered granada , the last muslim stronghold on the iberian peninsula , and they received columbus in córdoba , in the " alcázar " castle .
isabella turned him down on the advice of her confessor .
columbus was leaving town by mule in despair when ferdinand intervened .
isabella then sent a royal guard to fetch him , and ferdinand later claimed credit for being " the principal cause why those islands were discovered " .
in the april *num* " capitulations of santa fe " , king ferdinand and queen isabella promised columbus that if he succeeded he would be given the rank of admiral of the ocean sea and appointed viceroy and governor of all the new lands he could claim for spain .
he had the right to nominate three persons , from whom the sovereigns would choose one , for any office in the new lands .
he would be entitled to *num* percent of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity .
additionally , he would also have the option of buying one-eighth interest in any commercial venture with the new lands and receive one-eighth of the profits .
columbus was later arrested in *num* and dismissed from his posts .
he and his sons , diego and fernando , then conducted a lengthy series of court cases against the castilian crown , known as the " pleitos colombinos " , alleging that the crown had illegally reneged on its contractual obligations to columbus and his heirs .
the columbus family had some success in their first litigation , as a judgment of *num* confirmed diego's position as viceroy , but reduced his powers .
diego resumed litigation in *num* , which lasted until *num* , and further disputes continued until *num* .
between *num* and *num* , columbus completed four round-trip voyages between spain and the americas , each voyage being sponsored by the crown of castile .
on his first voyage , he independently discovered the americas and magnetic declination .
these voyages marked the beginning of the european exploration and colonization of the american continents , and are thus of enormous significance in western history .
columbus always insisted , in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary , that the lands that he visited during those voyages were part of the asian continent , as previously described by marco polo and other european travelers .
columbus's refusal to accept that the lands he had visited and claimed for spain were not part of asia might explain , in part , why the american continent was named after the florentine explorer amerigo vespucci and not after columbus .
on the evening of *num* august *num* , columbus departed from palos de la frontera with three ships .
the largest was a carrack ( spanish : " nao " ) , the " santa maría " ex-"gallega " ( " galician " ) .
the other two were smaller caravels .
the name of one is lost : it is known today only by the nickname " pinta " , which in castilian of the time meant " painted one " .
the " santa clara " was nicknamed affectionately the " niña " ( " the little one " ) , a pun on the name of her owner , juan niño of moguer .
the monarchs forced the citizens of palos to contribute to the expedition .
the " santa maría " was owned by juan de la cosa and captained by columbus .
the " pinta " and the " niña " were piloted by the pinzón brothers ( martín alonso and vicente yáñez ) .
columbus first sailed to the canary islands , which belonged to castile .
he restocked provisions and made repairs in gran canaria , then departed from san sebastián de la gomera on *num* september , for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean .
at about *num* : *num* in the morning of *num* october ( *num* october , gregorian calendar new style ) , a lookout on the " pinta " , rodrigo de triana ( also known as juan rodríguez bermeo ) , spotted land , and immediately alerted the rest of the crew with a shout .
thereupon , the captain of the " pinta " , martín alonso pinzón , verified the discovery and alerted columbus by firing a lombard .
columbus later maintained that he himself had already seen a light on the land a few hours earlier , thereby claiming for himself the lifetime pension promised by ferdinand and isabella to the first person to sight land .
columbus called the island ( in what is now the bahamas ) " san salvador " ( meaning " holy savior " ) ; the natives called it guanahani .
exactly which island in the bahamas this corresponds to is unresolved .
based on primary accounts and on what one would expect from the geographic positions of the islands given columbus's course , the prime candidates are san salvador island ( so named in *num* on the theory that it was columbus's san salvador ) , samana cay , and plana cays .
the indigenous people he encountered , the lucayan , taíno , and arawak , were peaceful and friendly .
he called the inhabitants of the lands that he visited " indios " ( spanish for " indians " ) .
noting their gold ear ornaments , columbus took some of the arawaks prisoner and insisted that they guide him to the source of the gold .
from the entry in his journal of *num* october *num* , in which he wrote of them : " many of the men i have seen have scars on their bodies , and when i made signs to them to find out how this happened , they indicated that people from other nearby islands come to san salvador to capture them ; they defend themselves the best they can .
i believe that people from the mainland come here to take them as slaves .
they ought to make good and skilled servants , for they repeat very quickly whatever we say to them .
i think they can very easily be made christians , for they seem to have no religion .
if it pleases our lord , i will take six of them to your highnesses when i depart , in order that they may learn our language .
" columbus noted that their primitive weapons and military tactics made them susceptible to easy conquest , writing , " these people are very simple in war-like matters … i could conquer the whole of them with *num* men , and govern them as i pleased .
" columbus also explored the northeast coast of cuba , where he landed on *num* october .
on *num* november , martín alonso pinzón took the " pinta " on an unauthorized expedition in search of an island called " babeque " or " baneque " , which the natives had told him was rich in gold .
columbus , for his part , continued to the northern coast of hispaniola , where he landed on *num* december .
there , the " santa maría " ran aground on christmas day *num* and had to be abandoned .
the wreck was used as a target for cannon fire to impress the native peoples .
columbus was received by the native cacique guacanagari , who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind .
columbus left *num* men , including luis de torres , the " converso " interpreter , who spoke hebrew and arabic , and founded the settlement of " la navidad " at the site of present-day bord de mer de limonade , haiti .
columbus took more natives prisoner and continued his exploration .
he kept sailing along the northern coast of hispaniola with a single ship , until he encountered pinzón and the " pinta " on *num* january .
on *num* january *num* , columbus made his last stop of this voyage in the new world , in the bay of rincón at the eastern end of the samaná peninsula in northeast hispaniola .
there he encountered the warlike cigüayos , the only natives who offered violent resistance during his first voyage to the americas .
the cigüayos refused to trade the amount of bows and arrows that columbus desired ; in the ensuing clash one ciguayo was stabbed in the buttocks and another wounded with an arrow in his chest .
because of this and because of the cigüayos ' use of arrows , he called the inlet where he met them the bay of arrows ( or gulf of arrows ) .
columbus kidnapped about *num* to *num* natives and took them back with him ( only seven or eight of the natives arrived in spain alive ) .
columbus headed for spain on the " niña " , but a storm separated him from the " pinta , " and forced the " niña " to stop at the island of santa maria in the azores .
half of his crew went ashore to say prayers in a chapel to give thanks for having survived the storm .
but while praying , they were imprisoned by the governor of the island , ostensibly on suspicion of being pirates .
after a two-day standoff , the prisoners were released , and columbus again set sail for spain .
another storm forced him into the port at lisbon .
he anchored next to the king's harbor patrol ship on *num* march *num* in portugal .
there , he was interviewed by bartolomeu dias , who had rounded the cape of good hope a few years earlier , in 1488–1489 .
dias's success had complicated columbus's attempts to secure funding from the portuguese court because the sure route to the indies that dias pioneered made a risky , conjectural western route unnecessary .
not finding king john ii of portugal in lisbon , columbus wrote a letter to him and waited for john's reply .
john asked columbus to go to " vale do paraíso " north of lisbon to meet him .
relations between portugal and castile were poor at the time .
columbus went to meet with john at " vale do paraíso " .
hearing of columbus's discoveries , john told him that he believed the voyage to be in violation of the *num* treaty of alcáçovas .
after spending more than a week in portugal , and paying his respects to eleanor of viseu , columbus again set sail for spain .
ferdinand magellan was a young boy and a ward of eleanor's court ; it is likely he saw columbus during this visit .
after departing , and after reportedly being saved from assassins by king john , columbus crossed the bar of saltes and entered the harbor of palos de la frontera on *num* march *num* .
word of his finding new lands rapidly spread throughout europe .
columbus left the port of cádiz on *num* september *num* , with a fleet of *num* ships carrying *num* , *num* men and the supplies to establish permanent colonies in the new world .
the passengers included priests , farmers , and soldiers , who would be the new colonists .
this reflected the new policy of creating not just " colonies of exploitation " , but also " colonies of settlement " from which to launch missions dedicated to converting the natives to christianity .
modern studies suggest that , as reported by the " washington post " , " crew members may have included free black africans who arrived in the new world about a decade before the slave trade began .
" as in the first voyage , the fleet stopped at the canary islands , from which it departed on *num* october , following a more southerly course than on the previous expedition .
on *num* november , columbus sighted a rugged island that he named dominica ( latin for sunday ) ; later that day , he landed at marie-galante , which he named " santa maría la galante " .
after sailing past les saintes ( " los santos " , " the saints " ) , he arrived at the island of guadeloupe , which he named " santa maría de guadalupe de extremadura " , after the image of the virgin mary venerated at the spanish monastery of villuercas , in guadalupe , cáceres , spain .
he explored that island from *num* to *num* november .
michele da cuneo , columbus's childhood friend from savona , sailed with columbus during the second voyage and wrote : " in my opinion , since genoa was genoa , there was never born a man so well equipped and expert in the art of navigation as the said lord admiral .
" columbus named the small island of " saona .
.
.
to honor michele da cuneo , his friend from savona .
" the same childhood friend reported in a letter that columbus had provided one of the captured indigenous women to him .
he wrote , " while i was in the boat , i captured a very beautiful carib woman , whom the said lord admiral gave to me .
when i had taken her to my cabin she was naked—as was their custom .
i was filled with a desire to take my pleasure with her and attempted to satisfy my desire .
she was unwilling , and so treated me with her nails that i wished i had never begun .
but—to cut a long story short—i then took a piece of rope and whipped her soundly , and she let forth such incredible screams that you would not have believed your ears .
eventually we came to such terms , i assure you , that you would have thought that she had been brought up in a school for whores .
" pedro de las casas , father of the priest bartolomé de las casas , also accompanied columbus on this voyage .
the exact course of columbus's voyage through the lesser antilles is debated , but it seems likely that he turned north , sighting and naming several islands , including : columbus also sighted the chain of the virgin islands , which he named " islas de santa úrsula y las once mil vírgenes " , " islands of saint ursula and the *num* , *num* virgins " ( shortened , both on maps of the time and in common parlance , to " islas vírgenes " ) .
he also named the islands of virgin gorda ( " fat virgin " ) , tortola , and peter island ( " san pedro " ) .
one of the first skirmishes between native americans and europeans since the time of the vikings occurred on *num* november , when at saint croix , columbus's men rescued two native boys from several cannibalistic island caribs .
columbus's men pursued the carib canoe , which met them with arrows .
several europeans were wounded , but they killed all of the caribs , and learned that the two boys had recently been castrated by their captors .
columbus continued to the virgin islands , and landed in puerto rico , which he named " san juan bautista " in honor of saint john the baptist ( a name that was later given to the capital city of san juan ) .
on *num* november , columbus returned to hispaniola , where he intended to visit the fort of la navidad , built during his first voyage and located on the northern coast of haiti .
columbus found the fort in ruins , destroyed by the native taino people .
among the ruins were the corpses of *num* of the *num* spaniards who had stayed behind as the first colonists in the new world .
columbus then sailed more than eastwards along the northern coast of hispaniola , establishing a new settlement , which he called la isabela , in the present-day dominican republic .
however , la isabela proved to be poorly located and the settlement was short-lived .
according to the abstract of columbus's journal made by bartolomé de las casas , the objective of the third voyage was to verify the existence of a continent that king john ii of portugal suggested was located to the southwest of the cape verde islands .
king john reportedly knew of the existence of such a mainland because " canoes had been found which set out from the coast of guinea [ west africa ] and sailed to the west with merchandise .
" on *num* may *num* , columbus left with six ships from sanlúcar , spain , for his third trip to the new world .
three of the ships headed directly for hispaniola with much-needed supplies , while columbus took the other three in an exploration of what might lie to the south of the caribbean islands he had already visited , including a hoped-for passage to continental asia .
columbus led his fleet to the portuguese island of porto santo , his wife's native land .
he then sailed to madeira and spent some time there with the portuguese captain joão gonçalves da camara , before sailing to the canary islands and cape verde .
as he crossed the atlantic , columbus discovered that the angle between north as indicated by a magnetic compass and north as measured by the position of the pole star changed with his position ( a phenomenon now known as " compass variation " ) .
he would later use his previous measurements of the compass variation to adjust his reckoning .
after being becalmed for several days in the doldrums of the mid-atlantic , columbus's fleet regained its wind and , dangerously low on water , turned north in the direction of dominica , which columbus had visited in his previous voyage .
the ships arrived at king john's hypothesized continent , which is south america , when they sighted the land of trinidad on *num* july approaching from the southeast .
the fleet sailed along the southern coast and entered dragon's mouth , anchoring near soldado rock where they made contact with a group of native amerindians in canoes .
columbus then landed on trinidad at icacos point ( which he named " punta de arenal " ) on *num* august .
after resupplying with food and water , from *num* to *num* august columbus explored the gulf of paria , which separates trinidad from what is now venezuela , near the delta of the orinoco river .
he then touched the mainland of south america at the paria peninsula .
exploring the new continent , columbus correctly interpreted the enormous quantity of fresh water that the orinoco delivered into the atlantic ocean as evidence that he had reached a large landmass rather than another island .
he also speculated that the new continent might be the location of the biblical garden of eden .
he then sailed to the islands of chacachacare and margarita .
he sighted tobago ( which he named " bella forma " ) and grenada ( which he named " concepción " .
in poor health , columbus returned to hispaniola on *num* august , only to find that many of the spanish settlers of the new colony were in rebellion against his rule , claiming that columbus had misled them about the supposedly bountiful riches of the new world .
a number of returning settlers and sailors lobbied against columbus at the spanish court , accusing him and his brothers of gross mismanagement .
columbus had some of his crew hanged for disobedience .
he had an economic interest in the enslavement of the hispaniola natives and for that reason was not eager to baptize them , which attracted criticism from some churchmen .
an entry in his journal from september *num* reads : " from here one might send , in the name of the holy trinity , as many slaves as could be sold .
.
.
" columbus was eventually forced to make peace with the rebellious colonists on humiliating terms .
in *num* , the crown had him removed as governor , arrested , and transported in chains to spain ( see " accusations of tyranny " section below ) .
he was eventually freed and allowed to return to the new world , but not as governor .
before leaving for his fourth voyage , columbus wrote a letter to the governors of the bank of saint george , genoa , dated at seville , *num* april *num* .
he wrote " although my body is here my heart is always near you .
" columbus made a fourth voyage nominally in search of the strait of malacca to the indian ocean .
accompanied by his brother bartolomeo and his 13-year-old son fernando , he left cádiz on *num* may *num* , with his flagship " santa maría " and the vessels " gallega " , " vizcaína " , and " santiago de palos " .
he sailed to arzila on the moroccan coast to rescue portuguese soldiers whom he had heard were under siege by the moors .
on *num* june , they landed at carbet on the island of martinique ( " martinica " ) .
a hurricane was brewing , so he continued on , hoping to find shelter on hispaniola .
he arrived at santo domingo on *num* june , but was denied port , and the new governor refused to listen to his storm prediction .
instead , while columbus's ships sheltered at the mouth of the rio jaina , the first spanish treasure fleet sailed into the hurricane .
columbus's ships survived with only minor damage , while *num* of the *num* ships in the governor's fleet were lost to a storm on *num* july .
in addition to the ships , *num* lives ( including that of the governor , francisco de bobadilla ) and an immense cargo of gold were surrendered to the sea .
after a brief stop at jamaica , columbus sailed to central america , arriving at guanaja ( isla de pinos ) in the bay islands off the coast of honduras on *num* july .
here bartolomeo found native merchants and a large canoe , which was described as being " long as a galley " and filled with cargo .
on *num* august , he landed on the continental mainland at puerto castilla , near trujillo , honduras .
he spent two months exploring the coasts of honduras , nicaragua , and costa rica , before arriving in almirante bay in panama on *num* october .
on *num* december *num* , columbus and his crew found themselves in a storm unlike any they had ever experienced .
in his journal columbus writes , in panama , columbus learned from the ngobe of gold and a strait to another ocean , but was told by local leader quibían not to go past a certain point down the river .
after much exploration , in january *num* , he established a garrison at the mouth of the belén river .
on *num* april , one of the ships became stranded in the river .
at the same time , the garrison was attacked by quibían and the other ships were damaged .
shipworms also damaged the ships in tropical waters .
columbus left for hispaniola on *num* april heading north .
on *num* may he sighted the cayman islands , naming them " "las tortugas" " after the numerous sea turtles there .
his ships next sustained more damage in a storm off the coast of cuba .
unable to travel farther , on *num* june *num* they were beached in st .
ann's bay , jamaica .
for one year columbus and his men remained stranded on jamaica .
a spaniard , diego méndez , and some natives paddled a canoe to get help from hispaniola .
the governor , nicolás de ovando y cáceres , detested columbus and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men .
in the meantime columbus , in a desperate effort to induce the natives to continue provisioning him and his hungry men , won their favor by predicting a lunar eclipse for *num* february *num* , using abraham zacuto's astronomical charts .
help finally arrived , no thanks to the governor , on *num* june *num* , and columbus and his men arrived in sanlúcar , spain , on *num* november .
following his first voyage , columbus was appointed viceroy and governor of the indies under the terms of the capitulations of santa fe .
in practice , this primarily entailed the administration of the colonies in the island of hispaniola , whose capital was established in santo domingo .
by the end of his third voyage , columbus was physically and mentally exhausted , his body wracked by arthritis and his eyes by ophthalmia .
in october *num* , he sent two ships to spain , asking the court of spain to appoint a royal commissioner to help him govern .
by this time , accusations of tyranny and incompetence on the part of columbus had also reached the court .
queen isabella and king ferdinand responded by removing columbus from power and replacing him with francisco de bobadilla , a member of the order of calatrava .
bobadilla , who ruled as governor from *num* until his death in a storm in *num* , had also been tasked by the court with investigating the accusations of brutality made against columbus .
arriving in santo domingo while columbus was away in the explorations of his third voyage , bobadilla was immediately met with complaints about all three columbus brothers : christopher , bartolomeo , and diego .
bobadilla reported to spain that columbus regularly used torture and mutilation to govern hispaniola .
the 48-page report , found in *num* in the national archive in the spanish city of simancas , contains testimonies from *num* people , including both enemies and supporters of columbus , about the treatment of colonial subjects by columbus and his brothers during his seven-year rule .
according to the report , columbus once punished a man found guilty of stealing corn by having his ears and nose cut off and then selling him into slavery .
testimony recorded in the report stated that columbus congratulated his brother bartolomeo on " defending the family " when the latter ordered a woman paraded naked through the streets and then had her tongue cut out for suggesting that columbus was of lowly birth .
the document also describes how columbus put down native unrest and revolt ; he first ordered a brutal crackdown in which many natives were killed and then paraded their dismembered bodies through the streets in an attempt to discourage further rebellion .
" columbus's government was characterised by a form of tyranny , " consuelo varela , a spanish historian who has seen the document , told journalists .
" even those who loved him had to admit the atrocities that had taken place .
" because of their gross misgovernance , columbus and his brothers were arrested and imprisoned upon their return to spain from the third voyage .
they lingered in jail for six weeks before king ferdinand ordered their release .
not long after , the king and queen summoned the columbus brothers to the alhambra palace in granada .
there , the royal couple heard the brothers ' pleas ; restored their freedom and wealth ; and , after much persuasion , agreed to fund columbus's fourth voyage .
but the door was firmly shut on columbus's role as governor .
henceforth nicolás de ovando y cáceres was to be the new governor of the west indies .
columbus had always claimed the conversion of non-believers as one reason for his explorations , but he grew increasingly religious in his later years .
probably with the assistance of his son diego and his friend the carthusian monk gaspar gorricio , columbus produced two books during his later years : a " book of privileges " ( *num* ) , detailing and documenting the rewards from the spanish crown to which he believed he and his heirs were entitled , and a " book of prophecies " ( *num* ) , in which he considered his achievements as an explorer but a fulfillment of bible prophecy in the context of christian eschatology .
in his later years , columbus demanded that the spanish crown give him *num* percent of all profits made in the new lands , as stipulated in the capitulations of santa fe .
because he had been relieved of his duties as governor , the crown did not feel bound by that contract and his demands were rejected .
after his death , his heirs sued the crown for a part of the profits from trade with america , as well as other rewards .
this led to a protracted series of legal disputes known as the " pleitos colombinos " ( " columbian lawsuits " ) .
during a violent storm on his first return voyage , columbus , then *num* , suffered an attack of what was believed at the time to be gout .
in subsequent years , he was plagued with what was thought to be influenza and other fevers , bleeding from the eyes , and prolonged attacks of gout .
the suspected attacks increased in duration and severity , sometimes leaving columbus bedridden for months at a time , and culminated in his death *num* years later .
based on columbus's lifestyle and the described symptoms , modern doctors suspect that he suffered from reactive arthritis , rather than gout .
reactive arthritis , previously known as reiter's syndrome , is a joint inflammation caused by intestinal bacterial infections or after acquiring certain sexually transmitted diseases ( primarily chlamydia or gonorrhea ) .
" it seems likely that [ columbus ] acquired reactive arthritis from food poisoning on one of his ocean voyages because of poor sanitation and improper food preparation , " writes dr .
frank c .
arnett , a rheumatologist and professor of internal medicine , pathology and laboratory medicine the university of texas medical school at houston .
on *num* may *num* , aged probably *num* , columbus died in valladolid , spain .
his remains were first interred at valladolid , then at the monastery of la cartuja in seville ( southern spain ) by the will of his son diego colón , who had been governor of hispaniola .
in *num* , the remains were transferred to colonial santo domingo , in the present-day dominican republic .
in *num* , when france took over the entire island of hispaniola , columbus's remains were moved to havana , cuba .
after cuba became independent following the spanish–american war in *num* , the remains were moved back to spain , to the cathedral of seville , where they were placed on an elaborate catafalque .
however , a lead box bearing an inscription identifying " don christopher columbus " and containing bone fragments and a bullet was discovered at santo domingo in *num* .
to lay to rest claims that the wrong relics had been moved to havana and that columbus's remains had been left buried in the cathedral at santo domingo , dna samples of the corpse resting in seville were taken in june *num* ( " history today " august *num* ) as well as other dna samples from the remains of his brother diego and younger son fernando colón .
initial observations suggested that the bones did not appear to belong to somebody with the physique or age at death associated with columbus .
dna extraction proved difficult ; only short fragments of mitochondrial dna could be isolated .
the mitochondrial dna fragments matched corresponding dna from columbus's brother , giving support that both individuals had shared the same mother .
such evidence , together with anthropologic and historic analyses , led the researchers to conclude that the remains found in seville belonged to christopher columbus .
the authorities in santo domingo have never allowed the remains there to be exhumed , so it is unknown if any of those remains could be from columbus's body as well .
the dominican remains are located in " the columbus lighthouse " ( " faro a colón " ) , in santo domingo .
the anniversary of columbus's *num* landing in the americas is usually observed on *num* october in spain and throughout the americas , except canada .
in spain it is called the " fiesta nacional de españa y día de la hispanidad " , while a number of countries in latin america celebrate it as " día de la raza " .
in the united states it is called columbus day and is observed annually on the second monday in october .
there are efforts in the us to rename columbus day as indigenous peoples ' day .
the world columbian exposition in chicago , *num* , commemorated the *ord* anniversary of the landing of christopher columbus in the americas .
over *num* million people attended the exposition during its six-month duration .
the united states postal service participated in the celebration issuing the first us " commemorative postage stamps , a series of *num* postage issues called the columbian issue depicting columbus , queen isabella and others in the various stages of his several voyages .
the issues range in value from the 1-cent to the 5-dollar denominations .
under benjamin harrison and his postmaster general john wanamaker the columbian commemorative stamps were made available and were first issued at the world columbian exposition in chicago , illinois , in *num* .
wanamaker originally introduced the idea of issuing the nation's first commemorative stamp to harrison , the congress and the u .
s .
post office .
to demonstrate his confidence in the new columbian commemorative issues wanamaker purchased $10 , *num* worth of stamps with his own money .
the columbian exposition lasted several months , and over $40 million in commemorative postage stamps had been sold .
the *ord* anniversary columbian issues were very popular in the united states .
a total of two billion stamps were issued for all the columbian denominations , and *num* percent of these were the two-cent stamps , " landing of columbus " , which paid the first-class rate for domestic mail at the time .
in *num* , a second columbian issue was released that was identical to the first to commemorate the *ord* anniversary , except for the date in the upper right hand corner of each stamp .
these issues were made from the original dies of which the first engraved issues of *num* were produced .
the united states issued the series jointly for the first time with three other countries , italy in lire , portugal in escudos and spain in pesetas .
columbus's voyages are considered some of the most important events in world history , kickstarting modern globalism and resulting in major demographic , commercial , economic , social , and political changes .
these explorations resulted in the permanent contact between the two hemispheres .
there was a massive exchange of animals , plants , fungi , diseases , technologies , mineral wealth and ideas .
exposed to old world diseases , the indigenous populations of the new world collapsed and were largely replaced by europeans and africans who brought with them new methods of farming , business , governance , and religious worship .
though christopher columbus came to be considered the discoverer of america in us and european popular culture , his historical legacy is more nuanced .
america was discovered and populated by its indigenous population .
columbus was not even the first european to reach its shores , having been preceded by erik the red in 10th-century greenland and leif erikson in 11th-century vinland at l'anse aux meadows .
however , columbus's efforts brought the americas to the attention of europe at a time ripe for europe to act upon .
thus , columbus was able to initiate the enduring association between the earth's two major landmasses and their inhabitants .
" columbus's claim to fame isn't that he got there first , " explains historian martin dugard , " it's that he stayed .
" historians have traditionally argued that columbus remained convinced to the very end that his journeys had been along the east coast of asia , but writer kirkpatrick sale argues that a document in the " book of privileges " indicates columbus knew he found a new continent .
furthermore , his journals from the third voyage call the " land of paria " a " hitherto unknown " continent .
on the other hand , his other writings continued to claim that he had reached asia , such as a *num* letter to pope alexander vi where he asserted that cuba was the east coast of asia .
he also rationalized that the new continent of south america was the " earthly paradise " that was located " at the end of the orient " .
thus , it remains unclear what his true beliefs were .
the term " pre-columbian " is usually used to refer to the peoples and cultures of the americas before the arrival of columbus and his european successors .
columbus is often credited with refuting a prevalent belief in a flat earth .
however , this legacy is a popular misconception .
to the contrary , the spherical shape of the earth had been known to scholars since antiquity , and was common knowledge among sailors .
coincidentally , the oldest surviving globe of the earth , the erdapfel , was made in *num* just before columbus's return to europe .
as such it contains no sign of the americas and yet demonstrates the common belief in a spherical earth .
the scholar amerigo vespucci , who sailed to america in the years following columbus's first voyage , was the first to speculate that the land was not part of asia but in fact constituted some wholly new continent previously unknown to eurasians .
his travel journals , published 1502–04 , convinced german cartographer martin waldseemüller to reach the same conclusion , and in 1507—a year after columbus's death—waldseemüller published a world map calling the new continent " america " from vespucci's latinized name " americus " .
according to paul lunde , " the preoccupation of european courts with the rise of the ottoman turks in the east partly explains their relative lack of interest in columbus's discoveries in the west .
" historically , the english had downplayed columbus and emphasized the role of the venetian john cabot as a pioneer explorer , but for the emerging united states , cabot made for a poor national hero .
veneration of columbus in america dates back to colonial times .
the name columbia for " america " first appeared in a *num* weekly publication of the debates of the british parliament .
the use of columbus as a founding figure of new world nations and the use of the word " columbia " , or simply the name " columbus " , spread rapidly after the american revolution .
columbus's name was given to the federal capital of the united states ( district of columbia ) , the capital cities of two u .
s .
states ( ohio and south carolina ) , and the columbia river .
outside the united states the name was used in *num* for the gran colombia , a precursor of the modern republic of colombia .
numerous cities , towns , counties , streets , and plazas ( called plaza colón or plaza de colón throughout latin america and spain ) have been named after him .
a candidate for sainthood in the catholic church in *num* , celebration of columbus's legacy perhaps reached a zenith in *num* with the *ord* anniversary of his first arrival in the americas .
monuments to columbus like the columbian exposition in chicago and columbus circle in new york city were erected throughout the united states and latin america extolling him .
in *num* , descendants of columbus undertook to dismantle the columbus family chapel in spain and move it to boalsburg near state college , pennsylvania , where it may now be visited by the public .
at the museum associated with the chapel , there are a number of columbus relics worthy of note , including the armchair that the " admiral of the ocean sea " used at his chart table .
since the late *ord* century , historians have criticized columbus for initiating colonization and for abuse of natives .
among reasons for this criticism is the poor treatment of the native taíno people of hispaniola , whose population declined rapidly after contact with the spanish .
columbus required the natives to pay tribute in gold and cotton .
modern estimates for the pre-columbian population of hispaniola are around *num* , 000–300 , *num* .
according to the historian gonzalo fernandez de oviedo y valdes , by *num* , *num* years after columbus landed , and *num* years after he died , fewer than *num* taíno were living on the island .
the indigenous population declined rapidly , due primarily to the first pandemic of european endemic diseases , which struck hispaniola after *num* .
the natives had no acquired immunity to these new diseases and suffered high fatalities .
there is also documentation that they were overworked .
the natives of the island were systematically subjugated via the " encomienda " system implemented by columbus .
adapted to the new world from spain , it resembled the feudal system in medieval europe , as it was based on a lord offering " protection " to a class of people who owed labor .
in addition , spanish colonists under his rule began to buy and sell natives as slaves , including children .
when natives on hispaniola began fighting back against their oppressors in *num* , columbus's men captured *num* , *num* arawak men , women , and children in a single raid .
the strongest were transported to spain to be sold as slaves ; *num* percent of the *num* shipped died en route .
historian james w .
loewen asserts that " columbus not only sent the first slaves across the atlantic , he probably sent more slaves—about five thousand—than any other individual .
" according to spanish colonist and dominican friar bartolomé de las casas's contemporary " a short account of the destruction of the indies " , when slaves held in captivity began to die at high rates , columbus ordered all natives over the age of thirteen to pay a hawk's bell full of gold powder every three months .
natives who brought this amount to the spanish were given a copper token to hang around their necks .
the spanish cut off the hands of those without tokens , and left them to bleed to death .
thousands of natives committed suicide by poison to escape their persecution .
during his brief reign columbus was reported to have executed spanish colonists for minor crimes as well as use dismemberment as another form of punishment .
columbus's soldiers killed and enslaved with impunity at every landing .
when columbus fell ill in *num* , " what little restraint he had maintained over his men disappeared as he went through a lengthy period of recuperation .
the troops went wild , stealing , killing , raping , and torturing natives , trying to force them to divulge the whereabouts of the imagined treasure-houses of gold .
" according to las casas , *num* , *num* natives perished during this period .
upon his recovery , columbus organized his troops ' efforts , forming a squadron of several hundred heavily armed men and more than twenty attack dogs .
dogs were used to hunt down natives who attempted to flee .
columbus's men tore across the land , killing thousands of sick and unarmed natives .
soldiers would use their captives for sword practice , attempting to decapitate them or cut them in half with a single blow .
the arawaks attempted to fight back against columbus's men but lacked their armor , guns , swords , and horses .
when taken prisoner , they were hanged or burned to death .
desperation led to mass suicides and infanticide among the natives .
in just two years under columbus's governorship , over *num* , *num* of the *num* , 000–300 , *num* natives in haiti were dead , and in three decades , " virtually every member of the gentle race .
.
.
had been wiped out .
" disease , warfare and harsh enslavement contributed to the depopulation .
within indigenous circles , columbus is often viewed as a key agent of genocide .
samuel eliot morison , a harvard historian and author of a multivolume biography on columbus writes , " the cruel policy initiated by columbus and pursued by his successors resulted in complete genocide .
" loewen laments that while " haiti under the spanish is one of the primary instances of genocide in all human history " , only one major history text he reviewed mentions columbus's role in it .
however some of these accounts may be part of black legend , while others challenge the genocide narrative .
noble david cook , writing about the black legend and the conquest of the americas wrote , " there were too few spaniards to have killed the millions who were reported to have died in the first century after old and new world contact " .
he instead estimates that the death toll was caused by diseases like smallpox , which according to some estimates had an 80–90 % fatality rate in native american populations .
disease played a significant role in the destruction of the natives .
indirect evidence suggests that some serious illness may have arrived with the *num* colonists who accompanied columbus's second expedition in *num* .
by the end of *num* , disease and famine had claimed two-thirds of the spanish settlers .
a native nahuatl account depicted the social breakdown that accompanied the pandemics : " a great many died from this plague , and many others died of hunger .
they could not get up to search for food , and everyone else was too sick to care for them , so they starved to death in their beds .
" when the pandemic finally struck in *num* it wiped out much of the remaining native population .
charles c .
mann wrote " it was as if the suffering these diseases had caused in eurasia over the past millennia were concentrated into the span of decades .
" some historians have argued that , while brutal , columbus was simply a product of his time , and being a figure of the *ord* century , should not be judged by the morality of the *ord* century .
although an abundance of artwork involving christopher columbus exists , no authentic contemporary portrait has been found .
james w .
loewen , author of " lies my teacher told me " , believes the various posthumous portraits have no historical value .
sometime between *num* and *num* , alejo fernández painted an altarpiece , " the virgin of the navigators " , that includes a depiction of columbus .
the painting was commissioned for a chapel in seville's casa de contratación ( house of trade ) and remains there , as the earliest known painting about the discovery of the americas .
at the *num* world's columbian exposition , *num* alleged portraits of columbus were displayed ; most did not match contemporary descriptions .
these writings describe him as having reddish or blond hair , which turned to white early in his life , light colored eyes , as well as being a lighter-skinned person with too much sun exposure turning his face red .
accounts consistently describe columbus as a large and physically strong man of some or more in height , easily taller than the average european of his day .
the most iconic image of columbus is a portrait by sebastiano del piombo , which has been reproduced in many textbooks .
it agrees with descriptions of columbus in that it shows a large man with auburn hair , but the painting dates from *num* and cannot , therefore , have been painted from life .
furthermore , the inscription identifying the subject as columbus was probably added later , and the face shown differs from other images , including that of the " virgin of the navigators .

beauty beauty is a property or characteristic of an animal , idea , object , person or place that provides a perceptual experience of pleasure or satisfaction .
beauty is studied as part of aesthetics , culture , social psychology , philosophy and sociology .
an " ideal beauty " is an entity which is admired , or possesses features widely attributed to beauty in a particular culture , for perfection .
ugliness is the opposite of beauty .
the experience of " beauty " often involves an interpretation of some entity as being in balance and harmony with nature , which may lead to feelings of attraction and emotional well-being .
because this can be a subjective experience , it is often said that " beauty is in the eye of the beholder .
" however , given the empirical observations of things that are considered beautiful often aligning with the aforementioned nature and health thereof , beauty has been stated to have levels of objectivity as well .
there is also evidence that perceptions of beauty are determined by natural selection ; that things , aspects of people and landscapes considered beautiful are typically found in situations likely to give enhanced survival of the perceiving human's genes .
the classical greek noun that best translates to the english-language words " beauty " or " beautiful " was κάλλος , " kallos " , and the adjective was καλός , " kalos " .
however , " kalos " may and is also translated as ″good″ or ″of fine quality″ and thus has a broader meaning than mere physical or material beauty .
similarly , " kallos " was used differently from the english word beauty in that it first and foremost applied to humans and bears an erotic connotation .
the koine greek word for beautiful was ὡραῖος , " hōraios " , an adjective etymologically coming from the word ὥρα , " hōra " , meaning " hour " .
in koine greek , beauty was thus associated with " being of one's hour " .
thus , a ripe fruit ( of its time ) was considered beautiful , whereas a young woman trying to appear older or an older woman trying to appear younger would not be considered beautiful .
in attic greek , " hōraios " had many meanings , including " youthful " and " ripe old age " .
the earliest western theory of beauty can be found in the works of early greek philosophers from the pre-socratic period , such as pythagoras .
the pythagorean school saw a strong connection between mathematics and beauty .
in particular , they noted that objects proportioned according to the golden ratio seemed more attractive .
ancient greek architecture is based on this view of symmetry and proportion .
plato considered beauty to be the idea ( form ) above all other ideas .
aristotle saw a relationship between the beautiful ( " to kalon " ) and virtue , arguing that " virtue aims at the beautiful .
" classical philosophy and sculptures of men and women produced according to the greek philosophers ' tenets of ideal human beauty were rediscovered in renaissance europe , leading to a re-adoption of what became known as a " classical ideal " .
in terms of female human beauty , a woman whose appearance conforms to these tenets is still called a " classical beauty " or said to possess a " classical beauty " , whilst the foundations laid by greek and roman artists have also supplied the standard for male beauty in western civilization .
during the gothic era , the classical aesthetical canon of beauty was rejected as sinful .
later , renaissance and humanist thinkers rejected this view , and considered beauty to be the product of rational order and harmonious proportions .
renaissance artists and architects ( such as giorgio vasari in his " lives of artists " ) criticised the gothic period as irrational and barbarian .
this point of view of gothic art lasted until romanticism , in the *ord* century .
in the middle ages , catholic philosophers like thomas aquinas included beauty among the transcendental attributes of being .
in his summa theologica , aquinas described the three conditions of beauty as : integritas ( wholeness ) , consonantia ( harmony ) , claritas ( radiance of form ) in the gothic architecture of the high and late middle ages , light was considered the most beautiful revelation of god , which was heralded in design .
examples are the stained glass of gothic cathedrals including notre-dame de paris and chartes cathedral .
the age of reason saw a rise in an interest in beauty as a philosophical subject .
for example , scottish philosopher francis hutcheson argued that beauty is " unity in variety and variety in unity " .
the romantic poets , too , became highly concerned with the nature of beauty , with john keats arguing in " ode on a grecian urn " that in the romantic period , edmund burke postulated a difference between beauty in its classical meaning and the sublime .
the concept of the sublime , as explicated by burke and kant , suggested viewing gothic art and architecture , though not in accordance with the classical standard of beauty , as sublime .
the *ord* century saw an increasing rejection of beauty by artists and philosophers alike , culminating in postmodernism's anti-aesthetics .
this is despite beauty being a central concern of one of postmodernism's main influences , friedrich nietzsche , who argued that the will to power was the will to beauty .
in the aftermath of postmodernism's rejection of beauty , thinkers have returned to beauty as an important value .
american analytic philosopher guy sircello proposed his new theory of beauty as an effort to reaffirm the status of beauty as an important philosophical concept .
elaine scarry also argues that beauty is related to justice .
beauty is also studied by psychologists and neuroscientists in the field of experimental aesthetics and neuroesthetics respectively .
psychological theories see beauty as a form of pleasure .
correlational findings support the view that more beautiful objects are also more pleasing .
some studies suggest that higher experienced beauty is associated with activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex .
this approach of localizing the processing of beauty in one brain region has received criticism within the field .
the characterization of a person as “beautiful” , whether on an individual basis or by community consensus , is often based on some combination of " inner beauty " , which includes psychological factors such as personality , intelligence , grace , politeness , charisma , integrity , congruence and elegance , and " outer beauty " ( i .
e .
physical attractiveness ) which includes physical attributes which are valued on an aesthetic basis .
standards of beauty have changed over time , based on changing cultural values .
historically , paintings show a wide range of different standards for beauty .
however , humans who are relatively young , with smooth skin , well-proportioned bodies , and regular features , have traditionally been considered the most beautiful throughout history .
a strong indicator of physical beauty is " averageness " .
when images of human faces are averaged together to form a composite image , they become progressively closer to the " ideal " image and are perceived as more attractive .
this was first noticed in *num* , when francis galton overlaid photographic composite images of the faces of vegetarians and criminals to see if there was a typical facial appearance for each .
when doing this , he noticed that the composite images were more attractive compared to any of the individual images .
researchers have replicated the result under more controlled conditions and found that the computer generated , mathematical average of a series of faces is rated more favorably than individual faces .
it is argued that it is evolutionarily advantageous that sexual creatures are attracted to mates who possess predominantly common or average features , because it suggests the absence of genetic or acquired defects .
there is also evidence that a preference for beautiful faces emerges early in infancy , and is probably innate , and that the rules by which attractiveness is established are similar across different genders and cultures .
a feature of beautiful women that has been explored by researchers is a waist–hip ratio of approximately *num* .
*num* .
physiologists have shown that women with hourglass figures are more fertile than other women due to higher levels of certain female hormones , a fact that may subconsciously condition males choosing mates .
however , other commentators have suggested that this preference may not be universal .
for instance , in some non-western cultures in which women have to do work such as finding food , men tend to have preferences for higher waist-hip ratios .
beauty standards are rooted in cultural norms crafted by societies and media over centuries .
globally , it is argued that the predominance of white women featured in movies and advertising leads to a eurocentric concept of beauty , breeding cultures that assign inferiority to women of color .
thus , societies and cultures across the globe struggle to diminish the longstanding internalized racism .
the black is beautiful cultural movement sought to dispel this notion in the 1960s .
exposure to the thin ideal in mass media , such as fashion magazines , directly correlates with body dissatisfaction , low self-esteem , and the development of eating disorders among female viewers .
further , the widening gap between individual body sizes and societal ideals continues to breed anxiety among young girls as they grow , highlighting the dangerous nature of beauty standards in society .
the concept of beauty in men is known as ' bishōnen ' in japan .
bishōnen refers to males with distinctly feminine features , physical characteristics establishing the standard of beauty in japan and typically exhibited in their pop culture idols .
a multibillion-dollar industry of japanese aesthetic salons exists for this reason .
however , different nations have varying male beauty ideals ; eurocentric standards for men include tallness , leanness , and muscularity ; thus , these features are idolized through american media , such as in hollywood films and magazine covers .
the prevailing eurocentric concept of beauty has varying effects on different cultures .
primarily , adherence to this standard among african american women has bred a lack of positive reification of african beauty , and philosopher cornel west elaborates that , " much of black self-hatred and self-contempt has to do with the refusal of many black americans to love their own black bodies-especially their black noses , hips , lips , and hair .
" these insecurities can be traced back to global idealization of women with light skin , green or blue eyes , and long straight or wavy hair in magazines and media that starkly contrast with the natural features of african women .
similarly , internalized colorism is rooted in indian culture , in which prevailing value placed on fairer skin tones fuels the skin whitening industry ; products like fair & lovely thrive in india , with endorsement from bollywood celebrities , as well as a general idealization of fair women throughout the film , media , and advertising industries .
thus , such eurocentric beauty standards are maintained through indian culture , and encourage women to artificially change their appearances to adhere to beauty norms and ideals .
further , a societal divide exists between the northern and southern regions of india , as fairer complexioned north indians are culturally associated with beauty , intelligence , and wealth , based merely on adherence to eurocentric beauty ideals .
in east asian cultures , familial pressures and cultural norms shape beauty ideals ; professor and scholar stephanie wong's experimental study concluded that expecting that men in asian culture didn't like women who look “fragile” impacted the lifestyle , eating , and appearance choices made by asian american women .
in addition to the male gaze , media portrayals of asian women as petite and the portrayal of beautiful women in american media as fair complexioned and slim-figured induce anxiety and depressive symptoms among asian american women who don't fit either of these beauty ideals .
further , the high status associated with fairer skin can be attributed to asian societal history ; upper-class people hired workers to perform outdoor , manual labor , cultivating a visual divide overtime between lighter complexioned , wealthier families and sun tanned , darker laborers .
this along with the eurocentric beauty ideals embedded in asian culture has made skin lightening creams , rhinoplasty , and blepharoplasty ( an eyelid surgery meant to give asians a more european , " double-eyelid " appearance ) commonplace among asian women , illuminating the insecurity that results from cultural beauty standards .
beauty presents a standard of comparison , and it can cause resentment and dissatisfaction when not achieved .
people who do not fit the " beauty ideal " may be ostracized within their communities .
the television sitcom " ugly betty " portrays the life of a girl faced with hardships due to society's unwelcoming attitudes toward those they deem unattractive .
however , a person may also be targeted for harassment because of their beauty .
in " malèna " , a strikingly beautiful italian woman is forced into poverty by the women of the community who refuse to give her work for fear that she may " woo " their husbands .
the documentary " beauty in the eyes of the beheld " explores both the societal blessings and curses of female beauty through interviews of women considered beautiful .
researchers have found that good looking students get higher grades from their teachers than students with an ordinary appearance .
some studies using mock criminal trials have shown that physically attractive " defendants " are less likely to be convicted—and if convicted are likely to receive lighter sentences—than less attractive ones ( although the opposite effect was observed when the alleged crime was swindling , perhaps because jurors perceived the defendant's attractiveness as facilitating the crime ) .
studies among teens and young adults , such as those of psychiatrist and self-help author , eva ritvo , show that skin conditions have a profound effect on social behavior and opportunity .
how much money a person earns may also be influenced by physical beauty .
one study found that people low in physical attractiveness earn *num* to *num* percent less than ordinary looking people , who in turn earn *num* to *num* percent less than those who are considered good looking .
in the market for loans , the least attractive people are less likely to get approvals , although they are less likely to default .
in the marriage market , women's looks are at a premium , but men's looks do not matter much .
conversely , being very unattractive increases the individual's propensity for criminal activity for a number of crimes ranging from burglary to theft to selling illicit drugs .
discrimination against others based on their appearance is known as lookism .
st .
augustine said of beauty " beauty is indeed a good gift of god ; but that the good may not think it a great good , god dispenses it even to the wicked .
" philosopher and novelist umberto eco wrote " " ( *num* ) and " on ugliness " ( *num* ) .
a character in his novel " the name of the rose " declares : " three things concur in creating beauty : first of all integrity or perfection , and for this reason we consider ugly all incomplete things ; then proper proportion or consonance ; and finally clarity and light " , before going on to say " the sight of the beautiful implies peace " .
greece greece ( ) , officially the hellenic republic ( greek : ) , historically also known as hellas ( greek : ελλάς ) , is a country located in southern and southeast europe , with a population of approximately / 1e6 round *num* million as of .
athens is the nation's capital and largest city , followed by thessaloniki .
greece is located at the crossroads of europe , asia , and africa .
situated on the southern tip of the balkan peninsula , it shares land borders with albania to the northwest , north macedonia and bulgaria to the north , and turkey to the northeast .
the aegean sea lies to the east of the mainland , the ionian sea to the west , the cretan sea and the mediterranean sea to the south .
greece has the longest coastline on the mediterranean basin and the *ord* longest coastline in the world at in length , featuring a large number of islands , of which *num* are inhabited .
eighty percent of greece is mountainous , with mount olympus being the highest peak at .
the country consists of nine geographic regions : macedonia , central greece , the peloponnese , thessaly , epirus , the aegean islands ( including the dodecanese and cyclades ) , thrace , crete , and the ionian islands .
greece is considered the cradle of western civilisation , being the birthplace of democracy , western philosophy , western literature , historiography , political science , major scientific and mathematical principles , western drama and notably the olympic games .
from the eighth century bc , the greeks were organised into various independent city-states , known as " poleis " ( singular " polis " ) , which spanned the entire mediterranean region and the black sea .
philip of macedon united most of the greek mainland in the fourth century bc , with his son alexander the great rapidly conquering much of the ancient world , from the eastern mediterranean to india .
greece was annexed by rome in the second century bc , becoming an integral part of the roman empire and its successor , the byzantine empire , in which greek language and culture were dominant .
rooted in the first century a .
d .
, the greek orthodox church helped shape modern greek identity and transmitted greek traditions to the wider orthodox world .
falling under ottoman dominion in the *ord* century , the modern nation state of greece emerged in *num* following a war of independence .
greece's rich historical legacy is reflected by its *num* unesco world heritage sites .
the sovereign state of greece is a unitary parliamentary republic and developed country with an advanced high-income economy , a high quality of life , and a very high standard of living .
a founding member of the united nations , greece was the tenth member to join the european communities ( precursor to the european union ) and has been part of the eurozone since *num* .
it is also a member of numerous other international institutions , including the council of europe , the north atlantic treaty organization ( nato ) , the organisation for economic co-operation and development ( oecd ) , the world trade organization ( wto ) , the organization for security and co-operation in europe ( osce ) , and the organisation internationale de la francophonie ( oif ) .
greece's unique cultural heritage , large tourism industry , prominent shipping sector and geostrategic importance classify it as a middle power .
it is the largest economy in the balkans , where it is an important regional investor .
the names for the nation of greece and the greek people differ from the names used in other languages , locations and cultures .
the greek name of the country is " hellas " ( ) or " ellada " ( or ελλάδα ; in polytonic : ( , ) or ἑλλάδα ' ) , and its official name is the hellenic republic ( greek : ' ) .
in english , however , the country is usually called greece , which comes from latin " " ( as used by the romans ) and literally means ' the land of the greeks ' .
the earliest evidence of the presence of human ancestors in the southern balkans , dated to *num* , *num* bc , is to be found in the petralona cave , in the greek province of macedonia .
all three stages of the stone age ( paleolithic , mesolithic , and neolithic ) are represented in greece , for example in the franchthi cave .
neolithic settlements in greece , dating from the *ord* millennium bc , are the oldest in europe by several centuries , as greece lies on the route via which farming spread from the near east to europe .
greece is home to the first advanced civilizations in europe and is considered the birthplace of western civilisation , beginning with the cycladic civilization on the islands of the aegean sea at around *num* bc , the minoan civilization in crete ( 2700–1500 bc ) , and then the mycenaean civilization on the mainland ( 1900–1100 bc ) .
these civilizations possessed writing , the minoans writing in an undeciphered script known as linear a , and the mycenaeans in linear b , an early form of greek .
the mycenaeans gradually absorbed the minoans , but collapsed violently around *num* bc , during a time of regional upheaval known as the bronze age collapse .
this ushered in a period known as the greek dark ages , from which written records are absent .
though the unearthed linear b texts are too fragmentary for the reconstruction of the political landscape and can't support the existence of a larger state contemporary hittite and egyptian records suggest the presence of a single state under a " great king " based in mainland greece .
the end of the dark ages is traditionally dated to *num* bc , the year of the first olympic games .
the " iliad " and the " odyssey " , the foundational texts of western literature , are believed to have been composed by homer in the *ord* or *ord* centuries bc .
with the end of the dark ages , there emerged various kingdoms and city-states across the greek peninsula , which spread to the shores of the black sea , southern italy ( " magna graecia " ) and asia minor .
these states and their colonies reached great levels of prosperity that resulted in an unprecedented cultural boom , that of classical greece , expressed in architecture , drama , science , mathematics and philosophy .
in *num* bc , cleisthenes instituted the world's first democratic system of government in athens .
by *num* bc , the persian empire controlled the greek city states in asia minor and macedonia .
attempts by some of the greek city-states of asia minor to overthrow persian rule failed , and persia invaded the states of mainland greece in *num* bc , but was forced to withdraw after a defeat at the battle of marathon in *num* bc .
in response , the greek city-states formed the hellenic league in *num* bc , led by sparta , which was the first historically recorded union of greek states since the mythical union of the trojan war .
a second invasion by the persians followed in *num* bc .
following decisive greek victories in *num* and *num* bc at salamis , plataea , and mycale , the persians were forced to withdraw for a second time , marking their eventual withdrawal from all of their european territories .
led by athens and sparta , the greek victories in the greco-persian wars are considered a pivotal moment in world history , as the *num* years of peace that followed are known as the golden age of athens , the seminal period of ancient greek development that laid many of the foundations of western civilization .
lack of political unity within greece resulted in frequent conflict between greek states .
the most devastating intra-greek war was the peloponnesian war ( 431–404 bc ) , won by sparta and marking the demise of the athenian empire as the leading power in ancient greece .
both athens and sparta were later overshadowed by thebes and eventually macedon , with the latter uniting most of the city-states of the greek hinterland in the league of corinth ( also known as the " hellenic league " or " greek league " ) under the control of phillip ii .
despite this development , the greek world remained largely fragmented and would not be united under a single power until the roman years .
sparta did not join the league and actively fought against it , raising an army led by agis iii to secure the city-states of crete for persia .
following the assassination of phillip ii , his son alexander iii ( " the great " ) assumed the leadership of the league of corinth and launched an invasion of the persian empire with the combined forces of the league in *num* bc .
undefeated in battle , alexander had conquered the persian empire in its entirety by *num* bc .
by the time of his death in *num* bc , he had created one of the largest empires in history , stretching from greece to india .
his empire split into several kingdoms upon his death , the most famous of which were the seleucid empire , ptolemaic egypt , the greco-bactrian kingdom , and the indo-greek kingdom .
many greeks migrated to alexandria , antioch , seleucia , and the many other new hellenistic cities in asia and africa .
although the political unity of alexander's empire could not be maintained , it resulted in the hellenistic civilization and spread the greek language and greek culture in the territories conquered by alexander .
greek science , technology , and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the hellenistic period .
after a period of confusion following alexander's death , the antigonid dynasty , descended from one of alexander's generals , established its control over macedon and most of the greek city-states by *num* bc .
from about *num* bc the roman republic became increasingly involved in greek affairs and engaged in a series of wars with macedon .
macedon's defeat at the battle of pydna in *num* bc signalled the end of antigonid power in greece .
in *num* bc , macedonia was annexed as a province by rome , and the rest of greece became a roman protectorate .
the process was completed in *num* bc when the roman emperor augustus annexed the rest of greece and constituted it as the senatorial province of achaea .
despite their military superiority , the romans admired and became heavily influenced by the achievements of greek culture , hence horace's famous statement : " graecia capta ferum victorem cepit " ( " greece , although captured , took its wild conqueror captive " ) .
the epics of homer inspired the aeneid of virgil , and authors such as seneca the younger wrote using greek styles .
roman heroes such as scipio africanus , tended to study philosophy and regarded greek culture and science as an example to be followed .
similarly , most roman emperors maintained an admiration for things greek in nature .
the roman emperor nero visited greece in ad *num* , and performed at the ancient olympic games , despite the rules against non-greek participation .
hadrian was also particularly fond of the greeks .
before becoming emperor , he served as an eponymous archon of athens .
greek-speaking communities of the hellenised east were instrumental in the spread of early christianity in the *ord* and *ord* centuries , and christianity's early leaders and writers ( notably st paul ) were mostly greek-speaking , though generally not from greece itself .
the new testament was written in greek , and some of its sections ( corinthians , thessalonians , philippians , revelation of st .
john of patmos ) attest to the importance of churches in greece in early christianity .
nevertheless , much of greece clung tenaciously to paganism , and ancient greek religious practices were still in vogue in the late *ord* century ad , when they were outlawed by the roman emperor theodosius i in 391–392 .
the last recorded olympic games were held in *num* , and many temples were destroyed or damaged in the century that followed .
in athens and rural areas , paganism is attested well into the sixth century ad and even later .
the closure of the neoplatonic academy of athens by the emperor justinian in *num* is considered by many to mark the end of antiquity , although there is evidence that the academy continued its activities for some time after that .
some remote areas such as the southeastern peloponnese remained pagan until well into the *ord* century ad .
the roman empire in the east , following the fall of the empire in the west in the *ord* century , is conventionally known as the byzantine empire ( but was simply called " roman empire " in its own time ) and lasted until *num* .
with its capital in constantinople , its language and literary culture was greek and its religion was predominantly eastern orthodox christian .
from the *ord* century , the empire's balkan territories , including greece , suffered from the dislocation of barbarian invasions .
the raids and devastation of the goths and huns in the *ord* and *ord* centuries and the slavic invasion of greece in the *ord* century resulted in a dramatic collapse in imperial authority in the greek peninsula .
following the slavic invasion , the imperial government retained formal control of only the islands and coastal areas , particularly the densely populated walled cities such as athens , corinth and thessalonica , while some mountainous areas in the interior held out on their own and continued to recognize imperial authority .
outside of these areas , a limited amount of slavic settlement is generally thought to have occurred , although on a much smaller scale than previously thought .
however , the view that greece in late antiquity underwent a crisis of decline , fragmentation and depopulation is now considered outdated , as greek cities show a high degree of institutional continuity and prosperity between the *ord* and *ord* centuries ad ( and possibly later as well ) .
in the early *ord* century , greece had approximately *num* cities according to the synecdemus chronicle , and the period from the *ord* to the *ord* century ad is considered one of high prosperity not just in greece but in the entire eastern mediterranean .
until the *ord* century almost all of modern greece was under the jurisdiction of the holy see of rome according to the system of pentarchy .
byzantine emperor leo iii moved the border of the patriarchate of constantinople westward and northward in the *ord* century .
the byzantine recovery of lost provinces began toward the end of the *ord* century and most of the greek peninsula came under imperial control again , in stages , during the *ord* century .
this process was facilitated by a large influx of greeks from sicily and asia minor to the greek peninsula , while at the same time many slavs were captured and re-settled in asia minor and the few that remained were assimilated .
during the *ord* and *ord* centuries the return of stability resulted in the greek peninsula benefiting from strong economic growth – much stronger than that of the anatolian territories of the empire .
during that time , the greek orthodox church was also instrumental in the spread of greek ideas to the wider orthodox world .
following the fourth crusade and the fall of constantinople to the " latins " in *num* mainland greece was split between the greek despotate of epirus ( a byzantine successor state ) and french rule ( known as the " frankokratia " ) , while some islands came under venetian rule .
the re-establishment of the byzantine imperial capital in constantinople in *num* was accompanied by the empire's recovery of much of the greek peninsula , although the frankish principality of achaea in the peloponnese and the rival greek despotate of epirus in the north both remained important regional powers into the *ord* century , while the islands remained largely under genoese and venetian control .
during the paleologi dynasty ( 1261–1453 ) a new era of greek patriotism emerged accompanied by a turning back to ancient greece .
as such prominent personalities at the time also proposed changing the imperial title to " emperor of the hellenes " , and , in late fourteenth century , the emperor was frequently referred to as the " emperor of the hellenes " .
similarly , in several international treaties of that time the byzantine emperor is styled as " imperator graecorum " .
in the *ord* century , much of the greek peninsula was lost by the byzantine empire at first to the serbs and then to the ottomans .
by the beginning of the *ord* century , the ottoman advance meant that byzantine territory in greece was limited mainly to its then-largest city , thessaloniki , and the peloponnese ( despotate of the morea ) .
after the fall of constantinople to the ottomans in *num* , the morea was one of the last remnants of the byzantine empire to hold out against the ottomans .
however , this , too , fell to the ottomans in *num* , completing the ottoman conquest of mainland greece .
with the turkish conquest , many byzantine greek scholars , who up until then were largely responsible for preserving classical greek knowledge , fled to the west , taking with them a large body of literature and thereby significantly contributing to the renaissance .
while most of mainland greece and the aegean islands was under ottoman control by the end of the *ord* century , cyprus and crete remained venetian territory and did not fall to the ottomans until *num* and *num* respectively .
the only part of the greek-speaking world that escaped long-term ottoman rule was the ionian islands , which remained venetian until their capture by the first french republic in *num* , then passed to the united kingdom in *num* until their unification with greece in *num* .
while some greeks in the ionian islands and constantinople lived in prosperity , and greeks of constantinople ( phanariotes ) achieved positions of power within the ottoman administration , much of the population of mainland greece suffered the economic consequences of the ottoman conquest .
heavy taxes were enforced , and in later years the ottoman empire enacted a policy of creation of hereditary estates , effectively turning the rural greek populations into serfs .
the greek orthodox church and the ecumenical patriarchate of constantinople were considered by the ottoman governments as the ruling authorities of the entire orthodox christian population of the ottoman empire , whether ethnically greek or not .
although the ottoman state did not force non-muslims to convert to islam , christians faced several types of discrimination intended to highlight their inferior status in the ottoman empire .
discrimination against christians , particularly when combined with harsh treatment by local ottoman authorities , led to conversions to islam , if only superficially .
in the *ord* century , many " crypto-christians " returned to their old religious allegiance .
the nature of ottoman administration of greece varied , though it was invariably arbitrary and often harsh .
some cities had governors appointed by the sultan , while others ( like athens ) were self-governed municipalities .
mountainous regions in the interior and many islands remained effectively autonomous from the central ottoman state for many centuries .
when military conflicts broke out between the ottoman empire and other states , greeks usually took up arms against the ottomans , with few exceptions .
prior to the greek revolution of *num* , there had been a number of wars which saw greeks fight against the ottomans , such as the greek participation in the battle of lepanto in *num* , the epirus peasants ' revolts of 1600–1601 ( led by the orthodox bishop dionysios skylosophos ) , the morean war of 1684–1699 , and the russian-instigated orlov revolt in *num* , which aimed at breaking up the ottoman empire in favor of russian interests .
these uprisings were put down by the ottomans with great bloodshed .
on the other side , many greeks were conscripted as ottoman citizens to serve in the ottoman army ( and especially the ottoman navy ) , while also the ecumenical patriarchate of constantinople , responsible for the orthodox , remained in general loyal to the empire .
the *ord* and *ord* centuries are regarded as something of a " dark age " in greek history , with the prospect of overthrowing ottoman rule appearing remote with only the ionian islands remaining free of turkish domination .
corfu withstood three major sieges in *num* , *num* and *num* all of which resulted in the repulsion of the ottomans .
however , in the *ord* century , due to their mastery of shipping and commerce , a wealthy and dispersed greek merchant class arose .
these merchants came to dominate trade within the ottoman empire , establishing communities throughout the mediterranean , the balkans , and western europe .
though the ottoman conquest had cut greece off from significant european intellectual movements such as the reformation and the enlightenment , these ideas together with the ideals of the french revolution and romantic nationalism began to penetrate the greek world via the mercantile diaspora .
in the late *ord* century , rigas feraios , the first revolutionary to envision an independent greek state , published a series of documents relating to greek independence , including but not limited to a national anthem and the first detailed map of greece , in vienna , and was murdered by ottoman agents in *num* .
in the late eighteenth century , an increase in secular learning during the modern greek enlightenment led to the revival among greeks of the diaspora of the notion of a greek nation tracing its existence to ancient greece , distinct from the other orthodox peoples , and having a right to political autonomy .
one of the organizations formed in this intellectual milieu was the filiki eteria , a secret organization formed by merchants in odessa in *num* .
appropriating a long-standing tradition of orthodox messianic prophecy aspiring to the resurrection of the eastern roman empire and creating the impression they had the backing of tsarist russia , they managed amidst a crisis of ottoman trade , from *num* onwards , to engage traditional strata of the greek orthodox world in their liberal nationalist cause .
the filiki eteria planned to launch revolution in the peloponnese , the danubian principalities and constantinople .
the first of these revolts began on *num* march *num* in the danubian principalities under the leadership of alexandros ypsilantis , but it was soon put down by the ottomans .
the events in the north spurred the greeks of the peloponnese into action and on *num* march *num* the maniots declared war on the ottomans .
by the end of the month , the peloponnese was in open revolt against the ottomans and by october *num* the greeks under theodoros kolokotronis had captured tripolitsa .
the peloponnesian revolt was quickly followed by revolts in crete , macedonia and central greece , which would soon be suppressed .
meanwhile , the makeshift greek navy was achieving success against the ottoman navy in the aegean sea and prevented ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea .
in *num* and *num* the turks and egyptians ravaged the islands , including chios and psara , committing wholesale massacres of the population .
approximately three-quarters of the chios ' greek population of *num* , *num* were killed , enslaved or died of disease .
this had the effect of galvanizing public opinion in western europe in favor of the greek rebels .
tensions soon developed among different greek factions , leading to two consecutive civil wars .
meanwhile , the ottoman sultan negotiated with mehmet ali of egypt , who agreed to send his son ibrahim pasha to greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gain .
ibrahim landed in the peloponnese in february *num* and had immediate success : by the end of *num* , most of the peloponnese was under egyptian control , and the city of missolonghi—put under siege by the turks since april 1825—fell in april *num* .
although ibrahim was defeated in mani , he had succeeded in suppressing most of the revolt in the peloponnese and athens had been retaken .
after years of negotiation , three great powers , france , russian empire , and the united kingdom , decided to intervene in the conflict and each nation sent a navy to greece .
following news that combined ottoman–egyptian fleets were going to attack the greek island of hydra , the allied fleet intercepted the ottoman–egyptian fleet at navarino .
a week-long standoff ended with the battle of navarino which resulted in the destruction of the ottoman–egyptian fleet .
a french expeditionary force was dispatched to supervise the evacuation of the egyptian army from the peloponnese , while the greeks proceeded to the captured part of central greece by *num* .
as a result of years of negotiation , the nascent greek state was finally recognised under the london protocol in *num* .
in *num* , ioannis kapodistrias , from corfu , was chosen by the third national assembly at troezen as the first governor of the first hellenic republic .
kapodistrias established a series of state , economic and military institutions .
soon tensions appeared between him and local interests .
following his assassination in *num* and the subsequent london conference a year later , the great powers of britain , france and russia installed bavarian prince otto von wittelsbach as monarch .
otto's reign was despotic , and in its first *num* years of independence greece was ruled by a bavarian oligarchy led by joseph ludwig von armansperg as prime minister and , later , by otto himself , who held the title of both king and premier .
throughout this period greece remained under the influence of its three protecting great powers , france , russia , and the united kingdom , as well as bavaria .
in *num* an uprising forced the king to grant a constitution and a representative assembly .
despite the absolutism of otto's reign , the early years proved instrumental in creating institutions which are still the bedrock of greek administration and education .
important steps were taken in the creation of the education system , maritime and postal communications , effective civil administration and , most importantly , the legal code .
historical revisionism took the form of de-byzantinification and de-ottomanisation , in favour of promoting the country's ancient greek heritage .
in this spirit , the national capital was moved from nafplio , where it had been since *num* , to athens , which was at the time a village .
religious reform also took place , and the church of greece was established as greece's national church , although otto remained a catholic .
*num* march , the day of annunciation , was chosen as the anniversary of the greek war of independence in order to reinforce the link between greek identity and orthodoxy .
pavlos karolidis called the bavarian efforts to create a modern state in greece as " not only appropriate for the peoples ' needs , but also based on excellent administrative principles of the era " .
otto was deposed in the *num* october *num* revolution .
multiple causes led to his deposition and exile , including the bavarian-dominated government , heavy taxation , and a failed attempt to annex crete from the ottoman empire .
the catalyst for the revolt was otto's dismissal of konstantinos kanaris from the premiership .
a year later , he was replaced by prince wilhelm ( william ) of denmark , who took the name george i and brought with him the ionian islands as a coronation gift from britain .
a new constitution in *num* changed greece's form of government from constitutional monarchy to the more democratic crowned republic .
in *num* the concept of parliamentary majority as a requirement for the formation of a government was introduced by charilaos trikoupis , curbing the power of the monarchy to appoint minority governments of its preference .
corruption , coupled with trikoupis ' increased spending to fund infrastructure projects like the corinth canal , overtaxed the weak greek economy and forced the declaration of public insolvency in *num* .
greece also accepted the imposition of an international financial control authority to pay off the country's debtors .
another political issue in 19th-century greece was uniquely greek : the language question .
the greek people spoke a form of greek called demotic .
many of the educated elite saw this as a peasant dialect and were determined to restore the glories of ancient greek .
government documents and newspapers were consequently published in " katharevousa " ( purified ) greek , a form which few ordinary greeks could read .
liberals favoured recognising demotic as the national language , but conservatives and the orthodox church resisted all such efforts , to the extent that , when the new testament was translated into demotic in *num* , riots erupted in athens and the government fell ( the " evangeliaka " ) .
this issue would continue to plague greek politics until the 1970s .
all greeks were united , however , in their determination to liberate the hellenic lands under ottoman rule .
especially in crete , a prolonged revolt in 1866–1869 had raised nationalist fervour .
when war broke out between russia and the ottomans in *num* , greek popular sentiment rallied to russia's side , but greece was too poor , and too concerned about british intervention , to officially enter the war .
nevertheless , in *num* , thessaly and small parts of epirus were ceded to greece as part of the treaty of berlin , while frustrating greek hopes of receiving crete .
greeks in crete continued to stage regular revolts , and in *num* , the greek government under theodoros deligiannis , bowing to popular pressure , declared war on the ottomans .
in the ensuing greco-turkish war of *num* , the badly trained and equipped greek army was defeated by the ottomans .
through the intervention of the great powers , however , greece lost only a little territory along the border to turkey , while crete was established as an autonomous state under prince george of greece .
with state coffers empty , fiscal policy came under international financial control .
alarmed by the abortive ilinden uprising of the autonomist imro in *num* , the greek government , aiming to quell imro bands and detach the slavophone peasants of the region from bulgarian influence , sponsored a guerilla campaign in ottoman-ruled macedonia , led by greek officers and known as the macedonian struggle , which ended with the young turk revolution in *num* .
amidst general dissatisfaction with the seeming inertia and unattainability of national aspirations under the premiership of the cautious reformist theotokis , a group of military officers organised a coup in august *num* and shortly thereafter called to athens cretan politician eleftherios venizelos , who conveyed a vision of national regeneration .
after winning two elections and becoming prime minister in *num* , venizelos initiated wide-ranging fiscal , social , and constitutional reforms , reorganised the military , made greece a member of the balkan league , and led the country through the balkan wars .
by *num* , greece's territory and population had almost doubled , annexing crete , epirus , and macedonia .
in the following years , the struggle between king constantine i and charismatic venizelos over the country's foreign policy on the eve of first world war dominated the country's political scene , and divided the country into two opposing groups .
during parts of the ww1 , greece had two governments : a royalist pro-german one in athens and a venizelist pro-entente one in thessaloniki .
the two governments were united in *num* , when greece officially entered the war on the side of the entente .
in the aftermath of world war i , greece attempted further expansion into asia minor , a region with a large native greek population at the time , but was defeated in the greco-turkish war of 1919–1922 , contributing to a massive flight of asia minor greeks .
these events overlapped , with both happening during the greek genocide ( 1914–1922 ) , a period during which , according to various sources , ottoman and turkish officials contributed to the death of several hundred thousand asia minor greeks , along with similar numbers of assyrians and a rather larger number of armenians .
the resultant greek exodus from asia minor was made permanent , and expanded , in an official population exchange between greece and turkey .
the exchange was part of the terms of the treaty of lausanne which ended the war .
the following era was marked by instability , as over *num* .
*num* million propertyless greek refugees from turkey had to be integrated into greek society .
cappadocian greeks , pontian greeks , and non-greek followers of greek orthodoxy were all subject to the exchange as well .
some of the refugees could not speak the language , and were from what had been unfamiliar environments to mainland greeks , such as in the case of the cappadocians and non-greeks .
the refugees also made a dramatic post-war population boost , as the number of refugees was more than a quarter of greece's prior population .
following the catastrophic events in asia minor , the monarchy was abolished via a referendum in *num* and the second hellenic republic was declared .
in *num* , a royalist general-turned-politician georgios kondylis took power after a coup d'état and abolished the republic , holding a rigged referendum , after which king george ii returned to greece and was restored to the throne .
an agreement between prime minister ioannis metaxas and the head of state george ii followed in *num* , which installed metaxas as the head of a dictatorial regime known as the *ord* of august regime , inaugurating a period of authoritarian rule that would last , with short breaks , until *num* .
although a dictatorship , greece remained on good terms with britain and was not allied with the axis .
on *num* october *num* , fascist italy demanded the surrender of greece , but the greek administration refused , and , in the following greco-italian war , greece repelled italian forces into albania , giving the allies their first victory over axis forces on land .
the greek struggle and victory against the italians received exuberant praise at the time .
most prominent is the quote attributed to winston churchill : " hence we will not say that greeks fight like heroes , but we will say that heroes fight like greeks .
" french general charles de gaulle was among those who praised the fierceness of the greek resistance .
in an official notice released to coincide with the greek national celebration of the day of independence , de gaulle expressed his admiration for the greek resistance : in the name of the captured yet still alive french people , france wants to send her greetings to the greek people who are fighting for their freedom .
the *num* march *num* finds greece in the peak of their heroic struggle and in the top of their glory .
since the battle of salamis , greece had not achieved the greatness and the glory which today holds .
the country would eventually fall to urgently dispatched german forces during the battle of greece , despite the fierce greek resistance , particularly in the battle of the metaxas line .
adolf hitler himself recognised the bravery and the courage of the greek army , stating in his address to the reichstag on *num* december *num* , that : " historical justice obliges me to state that of the enemies who took up positions against us , the greek soldier particularly fought with the highest courage .
he capitulated only when further resistance had become impossible and useless .
" the nazis proceeded to administer athens and thessaloniki , while other regions of the country were given to nazi germany's partners , fascist italy and bulgaria .
the occupation brought about terrible hardships for the greek civilian population .
over *num* , *num* civilians died of starvation during the winter of 1941–1942 , tens of thousands more died because of reprisals by nazis and collaborators , the country's economy was ruined , and the great majority of greek jews were deported and murdered in nazi concentration camps .
the greek resistance , one of the most effective resistance movements in europe , fought vehemently against the nazis and their collaborators .
the german occupiers committed numerous atrocities , mass executions , and wholesale slaughter of civilians and destruction of towns and villages in reprisals .
in the course of the concerted anti-guerilla campaign , hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost *num* , *num* , *num* greeks left homeless .
in total , the germans executed some *num* , *num* greeks , the bulgarians *num* , *num* , and the italians *num* , *num* .
following liberation and the allied victory over the axis , greece annexed the dodecanese islands from italy and regained western thrace from bulgaria .
the country almost immediately descended into a bloody civil war between communist forces and the anti-communist greek government , which lasted until *num* with the latter's victory .
the conflict , considered one of the earliest struggles of the cold war , resulted in further economic devastation , mass population displacement and severe political polarisation for the next thirty years .
although the post-war decades were characterised by social strife and widespread marginalisation of the left in political and social spheres , greece nonetheless experienced rapid economic growth and recovery , propelled in part by the u .
s .
-administered marshall plan .
in *num* , greece joined nato , reinforcing its membership in the western bloc of the cold war .
king constantine ii's dismissal of george papandreou's centrist government in july *num* prompted a prolonged period of political turbulence , which culminated in a coup d'état on *num* april *num* by the regime of the colonels .
under the junta , civil rights were suspended , political repression was intensified , and human rights abuses , including state-sanctioned torture , were rampant .
economic growth remained rapid before plateauing in *num* .
the brutal suppression of the athens polytechnic uprising on *num* november *num* is claimed to have sent shockwaves through the regime , and a counter-coup overthrew georgios papadopoulos to establish brigadier dimitrios ioannidis as leader .
on *num* july *num* , turkey invaded the island of cyprus in response to a greek-backed cypriot coup , triggering a political crisis that led to the regime's collapse .
the former prime minister konstantinos karamanlis was invited back from paris where he had lived in self-exile since *num* , marking the beginning of the metapolitefsi era .
the first multiparty elections since *num* were held on the first anniversary of the polytechnic uprising .
a democratic and republican constitution was promulgated on *num* june *num* following a referendum which chose to not restore the monarchy .
meanwhile , andreas papandreou , george papandreou's son , founded the panhellenic socialist movement ( pasok ) in response to karamanlis's conservative new democracy party , with the two political formations dominating in government over the next four decades .
greece rejoined nato in *num* .
greece became the tenth member of the european communities ( subsequently subsumed by the european union ) on *num* january *num* , ushering in a period of sustained growth .
widespread investments in industrial enterprises and heavy infrastructure , as well as funds from the european union and growing revenues from tourism , shipping , and a fast-growing service sector raised the country's standard of living to unprecedented levels .
traditionally strained relations with neighbouring turkey improved when successive earthquakes hit both nations in *num* , leading to the lifting of the greek veto against turkey's bid for eu membership .
the country adopted the euro in *num* and successfully hosted the *num* summer olympic games in athens .
more recently , greece has suffered greatly from the late-2000s recession and has been central to the related european sovereign debt crisis .
due to the adoption of the euro , when greece experienced financial crisis , it could no longer devalue its currency to regain competitiveness .
youth unemployment was especially high during the 2000s .
the greek government-debt crisis , and subsequent austerity policies , have resulted in protests .
located in southern europe , greece is a transcontinental country that consists of a mountainous , peninsular mainland jutting out into the sea at the southern end of the balkans , ending at the peloponnese peninsula ( separated from the mainland by the canal of the isthmus of corinth ) and strategically located at the crossroads of europe , asia , and africa .
due to its highly indented coastline and numerous islands , greece has the *ord* longest coastline in the world with ; its land boundary is .
the country lies approximately between latitudes 34° and 42° n , and longitudes 19° and 30° e , with the extreme points being : eighty percent of greece consists of mountains or hills , making the country one of the most mountainous in europe .
mount olympus , the mythical abode of the greek gods , culminates at mytikas peak , the highest in the country .
western greece contains a number of lakes and wetlands and is dominated by the pindus mountain range .
the pindus , a continuation of the dinaric alps , reaches a maximum elevation of at mt .
smolikas ( the second-highest in greece ) and historically has been a significant barrier to east-west travel .
the pindus range continues through the central peloponnese , crosses the islands of kythera and antikythera and finds its way into southwestern aegean , in the island of crete where it eventually ends .
the islands of the aegean are peaks of underwater mountains that once constituted an extension of the mainland .
pindus is characterised by its high , steep peaks , often dissected by numerous canyons and a variety of other karstic landscapes .
the spectacular vikos gorge , part of the vikos-aoos national park in the pindus range , is listed by the guinness book of world records as the deepest gorge in the world .
another notable formation are the meteora rock pillars , atop which have been built medieval greek orthodox monasteries .
northeastern greece features another high-altitude mountain range , the rhodope range , spreading across the region of east macedonia and thrace ; this area is covered with vast , thick , ancient forests , including the famous dadia forest in the evros regional unit , in the far northeast of the country .
extensive plains are primarily located in the regions of thessaly , central macedonia and thrace .
they constitute key economic regions as they are among the few arable places in the country .
rare marine species such as the pinniped seals and the loggerhead sea turtle live in the seas surrounding mainland greece , while its dense forests are home to the endangered brown bear , the eurasian lynx , the roe deer and the wild goat .
greece features a vast number of islands , between *num* , *num* and *num* , *num* , depending on the definition , *num* of which are inhabited .
crete is the largest and most populous island ; euboea , separated from the mainland by the 60m-wide euripus strait , is the second largest , followed by lesbos and rhodes .
the greek islands are traditionally grouped into the following clusters : the argo-saronic islands in the saronic gulf near athens , the cyclades , a large but dense collection occupying the central part of the aegean sea , the north aegean islands , a loose grouping off the west coast of turkey , the dodecanese , another loose collection in the southeast between crete and turkey , the sporades , a small tight group off the coast of northeast euboea , and the ionian islands , located to the west of the mainland in the ionian sea .
the climate of greece is primarily mediterranean , featuring mild , wet winters and hot , dry summers .
this climate occurs at all coastal locations , including athens , the cyclades , the dodecanese , crete , the peloponnese , the ionian islands and parts of the central continental greece region .
the pindus mountain range strongly affects the climate of the country , as areas to the west of the range are considerably wetter on average ( due to greater exposure to south-westerly systems bringing in moisture ) than the areas lying to the east of the range ( due to a rain shadow effect ) .
the mountainous areas of northwestern greece ( parts of epirus , central greece , thessaly , western macedonia ) as well as in the mountainous central parts of peloponnese – including parts of the regional units of achaea , arcadia and laconia – feature an alpine climate with heavy snowfalls .
the inland parts of northern greece , in central macedonia and east macedonia and thrace feature a temperate climate with cold , damp winters and hot , dry summers with frequent thunderstorms .
snowfalls occur every year in the mountains and northern areas , and brief snowfalls are not unknown even in low-lying southern areas , such as athens .
phytogeographically , greece belongs to the boreal kingdom and is shared between the east mediterranean province of the mediterranean region and the illyrian province of the circumboreal region .
according to the world wide fund for nature and the european environment agency , the territory of greece can be subdivided into six ecoregions : the illyrian deciduous forests , pindus mountains mixed forests , balkan mixed forests , rhodope montane mixed forests , aegean and western turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests and crete mediterranean forests .
greece is a unitary parliamentary republic .
the nominal head of state is the president of the republic , who is elected by the parliament for a five-year term .
the current constitution was drawn up and adopted by the fifth revisionary parliament of the hellenes and entered into force in *num* after the fall of the military junta of 1967–1974 .
it has been revised three times since , in *num* , *num* and *num* .
the constitution , which consists of *num* articles , provides for a separation of powers into executive , legislative , and judicial branches , and grants extensive specific guarantees ( further reinforced in *num* ) of civil liberties and social rights .
women's suffrage was guaranteed with an amendment to the *num* constitution .
according to the constitution , executive power is exercised by the president of the republic and the government .
from the constitutional amendment of *num* the president's duties were curtailed to a significant extent , and they are now largely ceremonial ; most political power thus lies in the hands of the prime minister .
the position of prime minister , greece's head of government , belongs to the current leader of the political party that can obtain a vote of confidence by the parliament .
the president of the republic formally appoints the prime minister and , on his recommendation , appoints and dismisses the other members of the cabinet .
legislative powers are exercised by a 300-member elective unicameral parliament .
statutes passed by the parliament are promulgated by the president of the republic .
parliamentary elections are held every four years , but the president of the republic is obliged to dissolve the parliament earlier on the proposal of the cabinet , in view of dealing with a national issue of exceptional importance .
the president is also obliged to dissolve the parliament earlier , if the opposition manages to pass a motion of no confidence .
according to a *num* report by the oecd , greeks display a moderate level of civic participation compared to most other developed countries ; voter turnout was *num* percent during recent elections , lower than the oecd average of *num* percent .
since the restoration of democracy , the greek party system was dominated by the liberal-conservative new democracy ( nd ) and the social-democratic panhellenic socialist movement ( pasok ) .
other significant parties include the communist party of greece ( kke ) , the coalition of the radical left ( syriza ) the popular orthodox rally ( laos ) and the popular association – golden dawn .
pasok and nd largely alternated in power until the outbreak of the government-debt crisis in *num* .
since then , the two major parties , new democracy and pasok , have seen a sharp decline in popularity .
in november *num* , the two major parties joined the smaller popular orthodox rally in a grand coalition , pledging their parliamentary support for a government of national unity headed by former european central bank vice-president lucas papademos .
panos kammenos voted against this government and he split off from nd forming the right-wing populist independent greeks .
the coalition government led the country to the parliamentary elections of may *num* .
the power of the traditional greek political parties , pasok and new democracy , declined from *num* % to *num* % and from *num* % to *num* % , respectively , due to their support for austerity measures .
the leftist party syriza became the second major party , with an increase from *num* % to *num* % .
no party could form a sustainable government , which led to the parliamentary elections of june *num* .
the result of the second elections was the formation of a coalition government composed of new democracy ( *num* % ) , pasok ( *num* % ) and democratic left ( *num* % ) parties .
syriza has since overtaken pasok as the main party of the centre-left .
alexis tsipras led syriza to victory in the general election held on *num* january *num* , falling short of an outright majority in parliament by just two seats .
the following morning , tsipras reached an agreement with independent greeks party to form a coalition , and he was sworn in as prime minister of greece .
tsipras called snap elections in august *num* , resigning from his post , which led to a month-long caretaker administration headed by judge vassiliki thanou-christophilou , greece's first female prime minister .
in the september *num* general election , tsipras led syriza to another victory , winning *num* out of *num* seats and re-forming the coalition with the independent greeks .

the ministry identifies two issues of particular importance to the greek state : turkish challenges to greek sovereignty rights in the aegean sea and corresponding airspace ; the cyprus dispute and the turkish occupation of northern cyprus .
greece is a member of numerous international organizations , including the council of europe , the european union , the union for the mediterranean , the north atlantic treaty organization , the organisation internationale de la francophonie and the united nations , of which it is a founding member .

mandatory military service is nine months for the army and one year for the navy and air force .
additionally , greek males between the ages of *num* and *num* who live in strategically sensitive areas may be required to serve part-time in the national guard .

by late *num* , as a result of a combination of international and local factors , the greek economy ( which had fared well for much of the *ord* century , with high growth rates and low public debt ) faced its most-severe crisis since the restoration of democracy in *num* when the greek government revised its deficit from an estimated *num* % to *num* .
*num* % of gdp .
in the years before the crisis goldman sachs , jpmorgan chase , and numerous other banks had developed financial products which enabled the governments of greece , italy , and many other european countries to hide their borrowing .
dozens of similar agreements were concluded across europe whereby banks supplied cash in advance in exchange for future payments by the governments involved ; in turn , the liabilities of the involved countries were " kept off the books " .
these conditions had enabled greece as well as other european governments to spend beyond their means , while meeting the deficit targets set out in the maastricht treaty .
in may *num* , the greece's deficit was again revised and estimated to be *num* .
*num* % which was the second highest in the world relative to gdp , with iceland in first place at *num* .
*num* % and the united kingdom in third with *num* .
*num* % .
public debt was forecast , according to some estimates , to hit *num* % of gdp in the same year , causing a crisis of confidence in greece's ability pay back loans .
to avert a sovereign default , greece , the other eurozone members , and the international monetary fund agreed on a rescue package which involved giving greece an immediate € in loans , with additional funds to follow , totaling € .
to secure the funding , greece was required to adopt harsh austerity measures to bring its deficit under control .

a third bailout was agreed in july *num* , after a confrontation with the newly-elected government of alexis tsipras .
there was a *num* % drop in greece's gdp , connected with the bailout programmes .
this had a critical effect : the debt-to-gdp ratio , the key factor defining the severity of the crisis , would jump from its *num* level of *num* % to about *num* % , solely due to the shrinking economy .
in a *num* report , the imf admitted that it had underestimated the effects of so extensive tax hikes and budget cuts on the country's gdp and issued an informal apology .
the greek programmes imposed a very rapid improvement in structural primary balance ( at least two times faster than for other eurozone bailed-out countries ) .
the policies have been blamed for worsening the crisis , while greece's president , prokopis pavlopoulos , stressed the creditors ' share in responsibility for the depth of the crisis .

e .
by only about *num* % ( thanks , in part , to the *num* debt restructuring ) ; however , during the same period , the critical debt-to-gdp ratio shot up from *num* % to *num* % basically due to the severe gdp drop during the handling of the crisis .

other prominent cities with urban populations above *num* , *num* inhabitants include those of patras , heraklion , larissa , volos , rhodes , ioannina , agrinio , chania , and chalcis .
the table below lists the largest cities in greece , by population contained in their respective contiguous built up urban areas , which are either made up of many municipalities , evident in the cases of athens and thessaloniki , or are contained within a larger single municipality , case evident in most of the smaller cities of the country .
the results come from the preliminary figures of the population census that took place in greece in may *num* .
the greek constitution recognizes eastern orthodoxy as the " prevailing " faith of the country , while guaranteeing freedom of religious belief for all .

however , many refugees who settled in former ottoman muslim villages in central macedonia and were defined as christian orthodox caucasus greeks arrived from the former russian transcaucasus province of kars oblast after it had been retroceded to turkey but in the few years before the official population exchange .
judaism has been present in greece for more than *num* , *num* years .
the ancient community of greek jews are called romaniotes , while the sephardi jews were once a prominent community in the city of thessaloniki , numbering some *num* , *num* , or more than half of the population , by *num* .
however , after the german occupation of greece and the holocaust during world war ii , is estimated to number around *num* , *num* people .

since *num* , hellenic polytheism , or helenism has been legally recognised as an actively practiced religion in greece , with estimates of *num* , *num* active practitioners and an additional *num* , *num* " sympathisers " .
hellenism refers to various religious movements that continue , revive or reconstruct ancient greek religious practices .
the first textual evidence of the greek language dates back to *ord* century bc and the linear b script which is associated with the mycenaean civilization .
greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the mediterranean world and beyond during classical antiquity , and would eventually become the official parlance of the byzantine empire .
during the *ord* and *ord* centuries there was a major dispute known as the greek language question , on whether the official language of greece should be the archaic katharevousa , created in the *ord* century and used as the state and scholarly language , or the dimotiki , the form of the greek language which evolved naturally from byzantine greek and was the language of the people .
the dispute was finally resolved in *num* , when dimotiki was made the only official variation of the greek language , and katharevousa fell to disuse .
greece is today relatively homogeneous in linguistic terms , with a large majority of the native population using greek as their first or only language .
among the greek-speaking population , speakers of the distinctive pontic dialect came to greece from asia minor after the greek genocide and constitute a sizable group .
the cappadocian dialect came to greece due to the genocide as well , but is endangered and is barely spoken now .
indigenous greek dialects include the archaic greek spoken by the sarakatsani , traditionally transhument mountain shepherds of greek macedonia and other parts of northern greece .
the tsakonian language , a distinct greek language deriving from doric greek instead of koine greek , is still spoken in some villages in the southeastern peloponnese .
the muslim minority in thrace , which amounts to approximately *num* .
*num* % of the total population , consists of speakers of turkish , bulgarian ( pomaks ) and romani .
romani is also spoken by christian roma in other parts of the country .
further minority languages have traditionally been spoken by regional population groups in various parts of the country .
their use has decreased radically in the course of the *ord* century through assimilation with the greek-speaking majority .
today they are only maintained by the older generations and are on the verge of extinction .
this goes for the arvanites , an albanian-speaking group mostly located in the rural areas around the capital athens , and for the aromanians and moglenites , also known as vlachs , whose language is closely related to romanian and who used to live scattered across several areas of mountainous central greece .
members of these groups ethnically identify as greeks and are today all at least bilingual in greek .
near the northern greek borders there are also some slavic–speaking groups , locally known as " slavomacedonian"-speaking , most of whose members identify ethnically as greeks .
it is estimated that after the population exchanges of *num* , macedonia had *num* , *num* to *num* , *num* slavic speakers .
the jewish community in greece traditionally spoke ladino ( judeo-spanish ) , today maintained only by a few thousand speakers .
other notable minority languages include armenian , georgian , and the greco-turkic dialect spoken by the urums , a community of caucasus greeks from the tsalka region of central georgia and ethnic greeks from southeastern ukraine who arrived in mainly northern greece as economic migrants in the 1990s .
throughout the *ord* century , millions of greeks migrated to the united states , united kingdom , australia , canada , and germany , creating a large greek diaspora .
net migration started to show positive numbers from the 1970s , but until the beginning of the 1990s , the main influx was that of returning greek migrants or of pontic greeks and others from russia , georgia , turkey the czech republic , and elsewhere in the former soviet bloc .
a study from the mediterranean migration observatory maintains that the *num* census recorded *num* , *num* persons residing in greece without greek citizenship , constituting around *num* % of total population .
of the non-citizen residents , *num* , *num* were eu or european free trade association nationals and *num* , *num* were cypriots with privileged status .
the majority come from eastern european countries : albania ( *num* % ) , bulgaria ( *num* % ) and romania ( *num* % ) , while migrants from the former soviet union ( georgia , russia , ukraine , moldova , etc .
) comprise *num* % of the total .
some of the immigrants from albania are from the greek minority in albania centred on the region of northern epirus .
in addition the total albanian national population which includes temporary migrants and undocumented persons is around *num* , *num* .
the *num* census recorded *num* , *num* , *num* greek citizens ( *num* , *num* % ) , *num* , *num* albanian citizens ( *num* , *num* % ) , *num* , *num* bulgarian citizens ( *num* , *num* % ) , *num* , *num* romanian citizenship ( *num* , *num* % ) , *num* , *num* pakistani citizens ( *num* , *num* % ) , *num* , *num* georgian citizens ( *num* , *num* % ) and *num* , *num* people had other or unidentified citizenship ( *num* , *num* % ) .
*num* , *num* people of the total population of albanian citizens were reported in *num* as ethnic greeks from southern albania , in the historical region of northern epirus .
the greatest cluster of non-eu immigrant population are the larger urban centers , especially the municipality of athens , with *num* , *num* immigrants comprising *num* % of the local population , and then thessaloniki , with *num* , *num* immigrants reaching *num* % of the local population .
there is also a considerable number of co-ethnics that came from the greek communities of albania and the former soviet union .
greece , together with italy and spain , is a major entry point for illegal immigrants trying to enter the eu .
illegal immigrants entering greece mostly do so from the border with turkey at the evros river and the islands of the eastern aegean across from turkey ( mainly lesbos , chios , kos , and samos ) .
in *num* , the majority of illegal immigrants entering greece came from afghanistan , followed by pakistanis and bangladeshis .
in *num* , arrivals of refugees by sea had increased dramatically mainly due to the ongoing syrian civil war .
there were *num* , *num* arrivals by sea in greece , an almost fivefold increase to the same period of *num* , of which the syrians represent almost *num* % .
the majority of refugees and migrants use greece as a transit country , while their intended destinations are northern european nations such as austria , germany and sweden .
greeks have a long tradition of valuing and investing in " paideia " ( education ) , which was upheld as one of the highest societal values in the greek and hellenistic world .
the first european institution described as a university was founded in fifth-century constantinople and continued operating in various incarnations until the city's fall to the ottomans in *num* .
the university of constantinople was christian europe's first secular institution of higher learning , and by some measures was the world's first university .

post-compulsory secondary education also includes vocational training institutes ( ινστιτούτα επαγγελματικής κατάρτισης , " iek " ) which provide a formal but unclassified level of education .
as they can accept both " gymnasio " ( lower secondary school ) and " lykeio " ( upper secondary school ) graduates , these institutes are not classified as offering a particular level of education .
according to the framework law ( *num* / *num* ) , public higher education " highest educational institutions " ( ανώτατα εκπαιδευτικά ιδρύματα , " anótata ekpaideytiká idrýmata " , " αει " ) consists of two parallel sectors : the university sector ( universities , polytechnics , fine arts schools , the open university ) and the technological sector ( technological education institutions ( tei ) and the school of pedagogic and technological education ) .
there are also state non-university tertiary institutes offering vocationally oriented courses of shorter duration ( *num* to *num* years ) which operate under the authority of other ministries .
students are admitted to these institutes according to their performance at national level examinations taking place after completion of the third grade of " lykeio " .
additionally , students over twenty-two years old may be admitted to the hellenic open university through a form of lottery .
the capodistrian university of athens is the oldest university in the eastern mediterranean .
the greek education system also provides special kindergartens , primary , and secondary schools for people with special needs or difficulties in learning .
there are also specialist gymnasia and high schools offering musical , theological , and physical education .

the culture of greece has evolved over thousands of years , beginning in mycenaean greece and continuing most notably into classical greece , through the influence of the roman empire and its greek eastern continuation , the eastern roman or byzantine empire .
other cultures and nations , such as the latin and frankish states , the ottoman empire , the venetian republic , the genoese republic , and the british empire have also left their influence on modern greek culture , although historians credit the greek war of independence with revitalising greece and giving birth to a single , cohesive entity of its multi-faceted culture .
in ancient times , greece was the birthplace of western culture .
modern democracies owe a debt to greek beliefs in government by the people , trial by jury , and equality under the law .
the ancient greeks pioneered in many fields that rely on systematic thought , including biology , geometry , history , philosophy , physics and mathematics .
they introduced such important literary forms as epic and lyric poetry , history , tragedy , and comedy .
in their pursuit of order and proportion , the greeks created an ideal of beauty that strongly influenced western art .
artistic production in greece began in the prehistoric pre-greek cycladic and the minoan civilizations , both of which were influenced by local traditions and the art of ancient egypt .
there were several interconnected traditions of painting in ancient greece .
due to their technical differences , they underwent somewhat differentiated developments .
not all painting techniques are equally well represented in the archaeological record .
the most respected form of art , according to authors like pliny or pausanias , were individual , mobile paintings on wooden boards , technically described as panel paintings .
also , the tradition of wall painting in greece goes back at least to the minoan and mycenaean bronze age , with the lavish fresco decoration of sites like knossos , tiryns and mycenae .
much of the figural or architectural sculpture of ancient greece was painted colourfully .
this aspect of greek stonework is described as polychrome .
ancient greek sculpture was composed almost entirely of marble or bronze ; with cast bronze becoming the favoured medium for major works by the early *ord* century .
both marble and bronze are easy to form and very durable .
chryselephantine sculptures , used for temple cult images and luxury works , used gold , most often in leaf form and ivory for all or parts ( faces and hands ) of the figure , and probably gems and other materials , but were much less common , and only fragments have survived .
by the early *ord* century , the systematic excavation of ancient greek sites had brought forth a plethora of sculptures with traces of notably multicolored surfaces .
it was not until published findings by german archaeologist vinzenz brinkmann in the late *ord* century , that the painting of ancient greek sculptures became an established fact .
the art production continued also during the byzantine era .
the most salient feature of this new aesthetic was its “abstract , ” or anti-naturalistic character .
if classical art was marked by the attempt to create representations that mimicked reality as closely as possible , byzantine art seems to have abandoned this attempt in favor of a more symbolic approach .
the byzantine painting concentrated mainly on icons and hagiographies .
the macedonian art ( byzantine ) was the artistic expression of macedonian renaissance , a label sometimes used to describe the period of the macedonian dynasty of the byzantine empire ( 867–1056 ) , especially the *ord* century , which some scholars have seen as a time of increased interest in classical scholarship and the assimilation of classical motifs into christian artwork .
post byzantine art schools include the cretan school and heptanese school .
the first artistic movement in the greek kingdom can be considered the greek academic art of the *ord* century ( " munich school " ) .
notable modern greek painters include nikolaos gyzis , georgios jakobides , theodoros vryzakis , nikiforos lytras , konstantinos volanakis , nikos engonopoulos and yannis tsarouchis , while some notable sculptors are pavlos prosalentis , ioannis kossos , leonidas drosis , georgios bonanos and yannoulis chalepas .
the architecture of ancient greece was produced by the ancient greeks ( " hellenes " ) , whose culture flourished on the greek mainland , the aegean islands and their colonies , for a period from about *num* bc until the *ord* century ad , with the earliest remaining architectural works dating from around *num* bc .
the formal vocabulary of ancient greek architecture , in particular the division of architectural style into three defined orders : the doric order , the ionic order and the corinthian order , was to have profound effect on western architecture of later periods .
byzantine architecture is the architecture promoted by the byzantine empire , also known as the eastern roman empire , which dominated greece and the greek speaking world during the middle ages .
the empire endured for more than a millennium , dramatically influencing medieval architecture throughout europe and the near east , and becoming the primary progenitor of the renaissance and ottoman architectural traditions that followed its collapse .
after the greek independence , the modern greek architects tried to combine traditional greek and byzantine elements and motives with the western european movements and styles .
patras was the first city of the modern greek state to develop a city plan .
in january *num* , stamatis voulgaris , a greek engineer of the french army , presented the plan of the new city to the governor kapodistrias , who approved it .
voulgaris applied the orthogonal rule in the urban complex of patras .
two special genres can be considered the cycladic architecture , featuring white-coloured houses , in the cyclades and the epirotic architecture in the region of epirus .
after the establishment of the greek kingdom , the architecture of athens and other cities was mostly influenced by the neoclassical architecture .
for athens , the first king of greece , otto of greece , commissioned the architects stamatios kleanthis and eduard schaubert to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state .
as for thessaloniki , after the fire of *num* , the government ordered for a new city plan under the supervision of ernest hébrard .
other modern greek architects include anastasios metaxas , panagis kalkos , ernst ziller , dimitris pikionis and georges candilis .
theatre in its western form was born in greece .
the city-state of classical athens , which became a significant cultural , political , and military power during this period , was its centre , where it was institutionalised as part of a festival called the dionysia , which honoured the god dionysus .
tragedy ( late *ord* century bc ) , comedy ( *num* bc ) , and the satyr play were the three dramatic genres to emerge there .
during the byzantine period , the theatrical art was heavily declined .
according to marios ploritis , the only form survived was the folk theatre ( " mimos " and " pantomimos " ) , despite the hostility of the official state .
later , during the ottoman period , the main theatrical folk art was the " karagiozis " .
the renaissance which led to the modern greek theatre , took place in the venetian crete .
the modern greek theatre was born after the greek independence , in the early *ord* century , and initially was influenced by the heptanesean theatre and melodrama , such as the italian opera .
the nobile teatro di san giacomo di corfù was the first theatre and opera house of modern greece and the place where the first greek opera , spyridon xyndas ' " the parliamentary candidate " ( based on an exclusively greek libretto ) was performed .
during the late *ord* and early *ord* century , the athenian theatre scene was dominated by revues , musical comedies , operettas and nocturnes and notable playwrights included spyridon samaras , dionysios lavrangas , theophrastos sakellaridis and others .
the national theatre of greece was opened in *num* as " royal theatre " .
notable playwrights of the modern greek theatre include gregorios xenopoulos , nikos kazantzakis , pantelis horn , alekos sakellarios and iakovos kambanelis , while notable actors include cybele andrianou , marika kotopouli , aimilios veakis , orestis makris , katina paxinou , manos katrakis and dimitris horn .
significant directors include dimitris rontiris , alexis minotis and karolos koun .
greek literature can be divided into three main categories : ancient , byzantine and modern greek literature .
athens is considered the birthplace of western literature .
at the beginning of greek literature stand the two monumental works of homer : the " iliad " and the " odyssey " .
though dates of composition vary , these works were fixed around *num* bc or after .
in the classical period many of the genres of western literature became more prominent .
lyrical poetry , odes , pastorals , elegies , epigrams ; dramatic presentations of comedy and tragedy ; historiography , rhetorical treatises , philosophical dialectics , and philosophical treatises all arose in this period .
the two major lyrical poets were sappho and pindar .
the classical era also saw the dawn of drama .
of the hundreds of tragedies written and performed during the classical age , only a limited number of plays by three authors have survived : those of aeschylus , sophocles , and euripides .
the surviving plays by aristophanes are also a treasure trove of comic presentation , while herodotus and thucydides are two of the most influential historians in this period .
the greatest prose achievement of the *ord* century was in philosophy with the works of the three great philosophers .
byzantine literature refers to literature of the byzantine empire written in atticizing , medieval and early modern greek , and it is the expression of the intellectual life of the byzantine greeks during the christian middle ages .
although " popular " byzantine literature and early modern greek literature both began in the *ord* century , the two are indistinguishable .
modern greek literature refers to literature written in common modern greek , emerging from late byzantine times in the *ord* century .
the cretan renaissance poem " erotokritos " is undoubtedly the masterpiece of this period of greek literature .
it is a verse romance written around *num* by vitsentzos kornaros ( 1553–1613 ) .
later , during the period of greek enlightenment ( diafotismos ) , writers such as adamantios korais and rigas feraios prepared with their works the greek revolution ( 1821–1830 ) .
leading figures of modern greek literature include dionysios solomos , andreas kalvos , angelos sikelianos , emmanuel rhoides , demetrius vikelas , kostis palamas , penelope delta , yannis ritsos , alexandros papadiamantis , nikos kazantzakis , andreas embeirikos , kostas karyotakis , gregorios xenopoulos , constantine p .
two greek authors have been awarded the nobel prize in literature : george seferis in *num* and odysseas elytis in *num* .
most western philosophical traditions began in ancient greece in the *ord* century bc .
the first philosophers are called " presocratics , " which designates that they came before socrates , whose contributions mark a turning point in western thought .
the presocratics were from the western or the eastern colonies of greece and only fragments of their original writings survive , in some cases merely a single sentence .
a new period of philosophy started with socrates .
like the sophists , he rejected entirely the physical speculations in which his predecessors had indulged , and made the thoughts and opinions of people his starting-point .
aspects of socrates were first united from plato , who also combined with them many of the principles established by earlier philosophers , and developed the whole of this material into the unity of a comprehensive system .
aristotle of stagira , the most important disciple of plato , shared with his teacher the title of the greatest philosopher of antiquity .
but while plato had sought to elucidate and explain things from the supra-sensual standpoint of the forms , his pupil preferred to start from the facts given us by experience .
except from these three most significant greek philosophers other known schools of greek philosophy from other founders during ancient times were stoicism , epicureanism , skepticism and neoplatonism .
byzantine philosophy refers to the distinctive philosophical ideas of the philosophers and scholars of the byzantine empire , especially between the *ord* and *ord* centuries .
it was characterised by a christian world-view , but one which could draw ideas directly from the greek texts of plato , aristotle , and the neoplatonists .
on the eve of the fall of constantinople , gemistus pletho tried to restore the use of the term " hellene " and advocated the return to the olympian gods of the ancient world .
after *num* a number of greek byzantine scholars who fled to western europe contributed to the renaissance .
in modern period , diafotismos ( greek : διαφωτισμός , " enlightenment " , " illumination " ) was the greek expression of the age of enlightenment and its philosophical and political ideas .
some notable representatives were adamantios korais , rigas feraios and theophilos kairis .
other modern era greek philosophers or political scientists include cornelius castoriadis , nicos poulantzas and christos yannaras .
greek vocal music extends far back into ancient times where mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment , celebration and spiritual reasons .
instruments during that period included the double-reed aulos and the plucked string instrument , the lyre , especially the special kind called a kithara .
music played an important role in the education system during ancient times .
boys were taught music from the age of six .
later influences from the roman empire , middle east , and the byzantine empire also had effect on greek music .
while the new technique of polyphony was developing in the west , the eastern orthodox church resisted any type of change .
therefore , byzantine music remained monophonic and without any form of instrumental accompaniment .
as a result , and despite certain attempts by certain greek chanters ( such as manouel gazis , ioannis plousiadinos or the cypriot ieronimos o tragoudistis ) , byzantine music was deprived of elements of which in the west encouraged an unimpeded development of art .
however , this method which kept music away from polyphony , along with centuries of continuous culture , enabled monophonic music to develop to the greatest heights of perfection .
byzantium presented the monophonic byzantine chant ; a melodic treasury of inestimable value for its rhythmical variety and expressive power .
along with the byzantine ( church ) chant and music , the greek people also cultivated the greek folk song ( " demotiko " ) which is divided into two cycles , the akritic and klephtic .
the akritic was created between the *ord* and *ord* centuries and expressed the life and struggles of the akrites ( frontier guards ) of the byzantine empire , the most well known being the stories associated with digenes akritas .
the klephtic cycle came into being between the late byzantine period and the start of the greek war of independence .
the klephtic cycle , together with historical songs , " paraloghes " ( narrative song or ballad ) , love songs , mantinades , wedding songs , songs of exile and dirges express the life of the greeks .
there is a unity between the greek people's struggles for freedom , their joys and sorrow and attitudes towards love and death .
the heptanesean kantádhes ( καντάδες ' serenades ' ; sing .
: καντάδα ) became the forerunners of the greek modern urban popular song , influencing its development to a considerable degree .
for the first part of the next century , several greek composers continued to borrow elements from the heptanesean style .
the most successful songs during the period 1870–1930 were the so-called athenian serenades , and the songs performed on stage ( επιθεωρησιακά τραγούδια ' theatrical revue songs ' ) in revue , operettas and nocturnes that were dominating athens ' theater scene .
rebetiko , initially a music associated with the lower classes , later ( and especially after the population exchange between greece and turkey ) reached greater general acceptance as the rough edges of its overt subcultural character were softened and polished , sometimes to the point of unrecognizability .
it was the base of the later laïkó ( song of the people ) .
the leading performers of the genre include vassilis tsitsanis , grigoris bithikotsis , stelios kazantzidis , george dalaras , haris alexiou and glykeria .
regarding the classical music , it was through the ionian islands ( which were under western rule and influence ) that all the major advances of the western european classical music were introduced to mainland greeks .
the region is notable for the birth of the first school of modern greek classical music ( heptanesean or ionian school , greek : " επτανησιακή σχολή " ) , established in *num* .
prominent representatives of this genre include nikolaos mantzaros , spyridon xyndas , spyridon samaras and pavlos carrer .
manolis kalomiris is considered the founder of the greek national school of music .
in the *ord* century , greek composers have had a significant impact on the development of avant garde and modern classical music , with figures such as iannis xenakis , nikos skalkottas , and dimitri mitropoulos achieving international prominence .
at the same time , composers and musicians such as mikis theodorakis , manos hatzidakis , eleni karaindrou , vangelis and demis roussos garnered an international following for their music , which include famous film scores such as zorba the greek , serpico , never on sunday , america america , eternity and a day , chariots of fire , blade runner , among others .
greek american composers known for their film scores include also yanni and basil poledouris .
notable greek opera singers and classical musicians of the *ord* and *ord* century include maria callas , nana mouskouri , mario frangoulis , leonidas kavakos , dimitris sgouros and others .
during the dictatorship of the colonels , the music of mikis theodorakis was banned by the junta and the composer was jailed , internally exiled , and put in a concentration camp , before finally being allowed to leave greece due to international reaction to his detention .
released during the junta years , " anthrope agapa , ti fotia stamata " ( make love , stop the gunfire ) , by the pop group poll is considered the first anti-war protest song in the history of greek rock .
the song was echoing the hippie slogan make love , not war and was inspired directly by the vietnam war , becoming a " smash hit " in greece .
greece participated in the eurovision song contest *num* times after its debut at the *num* contest .
in *num* , greece won with the song " my number one " , performed by greek-swedish singer elena paparizou .
the song received *num* points with *num* sets of *num* points from belgium , bulgaria , hungary , the united kingdom , turkey , albania , cyprus , serbia & montenegro , sweden and germany and also became a smash hit in different countries and especially in greece .
the *ord* eurovision song contest was held in athens at the olympic indoor hall of the athens olympic sports complex in maroussi , with hosted by maria menounos and sakis rouvas .
greek cuisine is characteristic of the healthy mediterranean diet , which is epitomised by dishes of crete .
greek cuisine incorporates fresh ingredients into a variety of local dishes such as moussaka , pastitsio , classic greek salad , fasolada , spanakopita and souvlaki .
some dishes can be traced back to ancient greece like skordalia ( a thick purée of walnuts , almonds , crushed garlic and olive oil ) , lentil soup , retsina ( white or rosé wine sealed with pine resin ) and pasteli ( candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey ) .
throughout greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as meze with various dips such as tzatziki , grilled octopus and small fish , feta cheese , dolmades ( rice , currants and pine kernels wrapped in vine leaves ) , various pulses , olives and cheese .
olive oil is added to almost every dish .
some sweet desserts include melomakarona , diples and galaktoboureko , and drinks such as ouzo , metaxa and a variety of wines including retsina .
greek cuisine differs widely from different parts of the mainland and from island to island .
it uses some flavorings more often than other mediterranean cuisines : oregano , mint , garlic , onion , dill and bay laurel leaves .
other common herbs and spices include basil , thyme and fennel seed .
many greek recipes , especially in the northern parts of the country , use " sweet " spices in combination with meat , for example cinnamon and cloves in stews .
cinema first appeared in greece in *num* , but the first actual cine-theatre was opened in *num* in athens .
in *num* the " asty films company " was founded and the production of long films began .
" golfo " ( γκόλφω ) , a well known traditional love story , is considered the first greek feature film , although there were several minor productions such as newscasts before this .
in *num* orestis laskos directed " daphnis and chloe " ( " δάφνις και χλόη " ) , containing one of the first nude scene in the history of european cinema ; it was also the first greek movie which was played abroad .
in *num* katina paxinou was honoured with the best supporting actress academy award for " for whom the bell tolls " .
the 1950s and early 1960s are considered by many to be a " golden age " of greek cinema .
directors and actors of this era were recognised as important figures in greece and some gained international acclaim : george tzavellas , irene papas , melina mercouri , mihalis kakogiannis , alekos sakellarios , nikos tsiforos , iakovos kambanelis , katina paxinou , nikos koundouros , ellie lambeti and others .
more than sixty films per year were made , with the majority having film noir elements .
some notable films include " the drunkard " ( *num* , directed by george tzavellas ) , " the counterfeit coin " ( *num* , by giorgos tzavellas ) , " πικρό ψωμί " ( *num* , by grigoris grigoriou ) , " o drakos " ( *num* , by nikos koundouros ) , " stella " ( *num* , directed by cacoyannis and written by kampanellis ) , " woe to the young " ( *num* , by alekos sakellarios ) , " glory sky " ( *num* , by takis kanellopoulos ) and " the red lanterns " ( *num* , by vasilis georgiadis ) cacoyannis also directed " zorba the greek " with anthony quinn which received best director , best adapted screenplay and best film nominations .
finos film also contributed in this period with movies such as " λατέρνα , φτώχεια και φιλότιμο " , " madalena " , " i theia ap ' to chicago " , " το ξύλο βγήκε από τον παράδεισο " and many more .
during the 1970s and 1980s , theo angelopoulos directed a series of notable and appreciated movies .
his film " eternity and a day " won the palme d'or and the prize of the ecumenical jury at the *num* cannes film festival .
there are also internationally renowned filmmakers in the greek diaspora , such as the greek-french costa-gavras and the greek-americans elia kazan , john cassavetes and alexander payne .

the numerous gods of the ancient greek religion as well as the mythical heroes and events of the ancient greek epics ( " the odyssey " and " the iliad " ) and other pieces of art and literature from the time make up what is nowadays colloquially referred to as greek mythology .
apart from serving a religious function , the mythology of the ancient greek world also served a cosmological role as it was meant to try to explain how the world was formed and operated .
the principal gods of the ancient greek religion were the dodekatheon , or the " twelve gods " , who lived on the top of mount olympus .
the most important of all ancient greek gods was zeus , the king of the gods , who was married to hera , who was also zeus's sister .
the other greek gods that made up the twelve olympians were ares , poseidon , athena , demeter , dionysus , apollo , artemis , aphrodite , hephaestus and hermes .
apart from these twelve gods , greeks also had a variety of other mystical beliefs , such as nymphs and other magical creatures .
according to greek law , every sunday of the year is a public holiday .
since the late ' 70s , saturday also is a non school and not working day .
in addition , there are four mandatory official public holidays : *num* march ( " greek independence day " ) , easter monday , *num* august ( " assumption or dormition of the holy virgin " ) , and *num* december ( " christmas " ) .
*num* may ( " labour day " ) and *num* october ( " ohi day " ) are regulated by law as being optional but it is customary for employees to be given the day off .
there are , however , more public holidays celebrated in greece than are announced by the ministry of labour each year as either obligatory or optional .
the list of these non-fixed national holidays rarely changes and has not changed in recent decades , giving a total of eleven national holidays each year .
in addition to the national holidays , there are public holidays that are not celebrated nationwide , but only by a specific professional group or a local community .
for example , many municipalities have a " patron saint " parallel to " name days " , or a " liberation day " .
on such days it is customary for schools to take the day off .
notable festivals , beyond the religious fests , include patras carnival , athens festival and various local wine festivals .
the city of thessaloniki is also home of a number of festivals and events .
the thessaloniki international film festival is one of the most important film festivals in southern europe .
agent orange agent orange is an herbicide and defoliant chemical , one of the " tactical use " rainbow herbicides .
it is widely known for its use by the u .
s .
military as part of its herbicidal warfare program , operation ranch hand , during the vietnam war from *num* to *num* .
it is a mixture of equal parts of two herbicides , *num* , *num* , 5-t and *num* , 4-d .
in addition to its damaging environmental effects , traces of dioxin ( mainly tcdd , the most toxic of its type ) found in the mixture have caused major health problems for many individuals who were exposed .
up to four million people in vietnam were exposed to the defoliant .
the government of vietnam says as many as *num* million people have suffered illnesses because of agent orange .
the red cross of vietnam estimates that up to *num* million people are disabled or have health problems as a result of agent orange contamination .
the united states government has challenged these figures as being unreliable .
the chemical is capable of damaging genes , resulting in deformities among the offspring of exposed victims .
the u .
s .
government has documented higher cases of leukemia , hodgkin's lymphoma , and various kinds of cancer in exposed veterans .
agent orange also caused enormous environmental damage in vietnam .
over *num* , *num* , *num* hectares ( *num* , *num* km or *num* , *num* mi ) of forest were defoliated .
defoliants eroded tree cover and seedling forest stock , making reforestation difficult in numerous areas .
animal species diversity sharply reduced in contrast with unsprayed areas .
the aftermath of the use of agent orange in vietnam resulted in massive legal consequences .
the united nations ratified united nations general assembly resolution *num* / *num* and the environmental modification convention .
lawsuits filed on behalf of both us and vietnamese veterans sought compensation for damages .
agent orange was to a lesser extent used outside vietnam .
land in neighbouring laos and cambodia was also sprayed with agent orange during the vietnam war because forests on the border with vietnam were used by the vietcong .
some countries , such as canada , saw testing , while other countries , such as brazil , used the herbicide to clear out sections of land for agriculture .
the active ingredient of agent orange was an equal mixture of two phenoxy herbicides – *num* , 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ( *num* , 4-d ) and *num* , *num* , 5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid ( *num* , *num* , 5-t ) – in iso-octyl ester form , which contained traces of the dioxin *num* , *num* , *num* , 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-"p"-dioxin ( tcdd ) .
tcdd was a trace ( typically 2-3 ppm , but ranging from *num* ppb to *num* ppm ) , but significant contaminant of agent orange .
tcdd is the most toxic of the dioxins , and is classified as a human carcinogen by the us environmental protection agency .
if not bound chemically to a biological surface such as soil , leaves or grass , agent orange dries quickly after spraying and breaks down within hours to days when exposed to sunlight and is no longer harmful .
due to its fat-soluble nature , tcdd enters the body through physical contact or ingestion .
dioxin easily accumulates in the food chain .
dioxin enters the body by attaching to a protein called the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( ahr ) , a transcription factor .
when tcdd binds to ahr , the protein moves to the nucleus , where it influences gene expression .
several herbicides were discovered as part of efforts by the us and the british to develop herbicidal weapons for use during world war ii .
these included *num* , 4-d ( *num* , 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ) , *num* , *num* , 5-t ( coded ln-14 , and also known as trioxone ) , mcpa ( 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid , 1414b and 1414a , recoded ln-8 and ln-32 ) , and isopropyl phenylcarbamate ( *num* , recoded ln-33 ) .
in *num* , the u .
s .
department of the army contracted the botanist and bioethicist arthur galston , who discovered the defoliants later used in agent orange , and his employer university of illinois at urbana–champaign to study the effects of *num* , 4-d and *num* , *num* , 5-t on cereal grains ( including rice ) and broadleaf crops .
galston , then a graduate student at the university of illinois , in his research and *num* ph .
d .
dissertation focused on finding a chemical means to make soybeans flower and fruit earlier .
he discovered both that *num* , *num* , 5-triiodobenzoic acid ( tiba ) would speed up the flowering of soybeans and that in higher concentrations it would defoliate the soybeans .
from these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply .
in early *num* , the u .
s .
army ran tests of various *num* , 4-d and *num* , *num* , 5-t mixtures at the bushnell army airfield in florida .
as a result , the u .
s .
began a full-scale production of *num* , 4-d and *num* , *num* , 5-t and would have used it against japan in *num* during operation downfall if the war had continued .
by the end of the war , the relationship between the two countries was well established .
in the years after the war , the u .
s .
tested *num* , *num* compounds , and field trials of the more promising ones were done at british stations in india and australia , in order to establish their effects in tropical conditions , as well as at the u .
s .
' s testing ground in florida .
between *num* and *num* , trials were conducted in tanganyika , at kikore and stunyansa , to test arboricides and defoliants under tropical conditions .
the chemicals involved were *num* , 4-d , *num* , *num* , 5-t , and endothall ( *num* , 6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid ) .
during 1952–53 , the unit supervised the aerial spraying of *num* , *num* , 5-t over the waturi peninsula in kenya to assess the value of defoliants in the eradication of tsetse fly .
during the malayan emergency ( 1948–1960 ) , britain was the first nation to employ the use of herbicides and defoliants to destroy bushes , trees , and vegetation to deprive insurgents of concealment and targeting food crops as part of a starvation campaign in the early 1950s .
a detailed account of how the british experimented with the spraying of herbicides was written by two scientists , e .
k .
woodford of agricultural research council's unit of experimental agronomy and h .
g .
h .
kearns of the university of bristol .
after the malayan conflict ended in *num* , the u .
s .
considered the british precedent in deciding that the use of defoliants was a legal tactic of warfare .
secretary of state dean rusk advised president john f .
kennedy that the british had established a precedent for warfare with herbicides in malaya .
in mid-1961 , president ngo dinh diem of south vietnam asked the united states to conduct aerial herbicide spraying in his country .
in august of that year , the republic of vietnam air force conducted herbicide operations with american help .
but diem's request launched a policy debate in the white house and the state and defense departments .
however , u .
s .
officials considered using it , pointing out that the british had already used herbicides and defoliants during the malayan emergency in the 1950s .
in november *num* , president john f .
kennedy authorized the start of operation ranch hand , the codename for the u .
s .
air force's herbicide program in vietnam .
during the vietnam war , between *num* and *num* , the united states military sprayed nearly of various chemicals – the " rainbow herbicides " and defoliants – in vietnam , eastern laos , and parts of cambodia as part of the aerial defoliation program known as operation ranch hand , reaching its peak from *num* to *num* .
for comparison purposes , an olympic size pool holds approximately .
as the british did in malaya , the goal of the us was to defoliate rural / forested land , depriving guerrillas of food and concealment and clearing sensitive areas such as around base perimeters .
the program was also a part of a general policy of forced draft urbanization , which aimed to destroy the ability of peasants to support themselves in the countryside , forcing them to flee to the u .
s .
-dominated cities , depriving the guerrillas of their rural support base .
agent orange was usually sprayed from helicopters or from low-flying c-123 provider aircraft , fitted with sprayers and " mc-1 hourglass " pump systems and chemical tanks .
spray runs were also conducted from trucks , boats , and backpack sprayers .
the first batch of herbicides was unloaded at tan son nhut air base in south vietnam , on january *num* , *num* .
u .
s .
air force records show at least *num* , *num* spraying missions took place over the course of operation ranch hand .
by *num* , *num* percent of the total area of south vietnam had been sprayed with defoliating chemicals , at an average concentration of *num* times the recommended u .
s .
department of agriculture application rate for domestic use .
in south vietnam alone , an estimated of agricultural land was ultimately destroyed .
in some areas , tcdd concentrations in soil and water were hundreds of times greater than the levels considered safe by the u .
s .
environmental protection agency .
the campaign destroyed of upland and mangrove forests and thousands of square kilometres of crops .
overall , more than *num* % of south vietnam's forests were sprayed at least once over a nine-year period .
in *num* , members of the u .
s .
congress were told " crop destruction is understood to be the more important purpose .
.
.
but the emphasis is usually given to the jungle defoliation in public mention of the program .
" military personnel were told they were destroying crops because they were going to be used to feed guerrillas .
they later discovered nearly all of the food they had been destroying was not being produced for guerrillas ; it was , in reality , only being grown to support the local civilian population .
for example , in quang ngai province , *num* % of the crop lands were scheduled to be destroyed in *num* alone .
this contributed to widespread famine , leaving hundreds of thousands of people malnourished or starving .
the u .
s .
military began targeting food crops in october *num* , primarily using agent blue ; the american public was not made aware of the crop destruction programs until *num* ( and it was then believed that crop spraying had begun that spring ) .
in *num* , *num* percent of all herbicide spraying was dedicated to food crops .
the first official acknowledgement of the programs came from the state department in march *num* .
many experts at the time , including arthur galston , opposed herbicidal warfare due to concerns about the side effects to humans and the environment by indiscriminately spraying the chemical over a wide area .
as early as *num* , resolutions were introduced to the united nations charging that the u .
s .
was violating the *num* geneva protocol , which regulated the use of chemical and biological weapons .
the u .
s .
defeated most of the resolutions , arguing that agent orange was not a chemical or a biological weapon as it was considered a herbicide and a defoliant and it was used in effort to destroy plant crops and to deprive the enemy of concealment and not meant to target human beings .
the u .
s .
delegation argued that a weapon , by definition , is any device used to injure , defeat , or destroy living beings , structures , or systems , and agent orange did not qualify under that definition .
it also argued that if the u .
s .
were to be charged for using agent orange , then britain and its commonwealth nations should be charged since they also used it widely during the malayan emergency in the 1950s .
in *num* , britain commented on the draft resolution *num* ( xxiv ) : " the evidence seems to us to be notably inadequate for the assertion that the use in war of chemical substances specifically toxic to plants is prohibited by international law .
" the government of vietnam says that *num* million of its citizens were exposed to agent orange , and as many as *num* million have suffered illnesses because of it ; these figures include their children who were exposed .
the red cross of vietnam estimates that up to *num* million people are disabled or have health problems due to contaminated agent orange .
the united states government has challenged these figures as being unreliable .
according to a study by dr .
nguyen viet nhan , children in the areas where agent orange was used have been affected and have multiple health problems , including cleft palate , mental disabilities , hernias , and extra fingers and toes .
in the 1970s , high levels of dioxin were found in the breast milk of south vietnamese women , and in the blood of u .
s .
military personnel who had served in vietnam .
the most affected zones are the mountainous area along truong son ( long mountains ) and the border between vietnam and cambodia .
the affected residents are living in substandard conditions with many genetic diseases .
in *num* , anh duc ngo and colleagues of the university of texas health science center published a meta-analysis that exposed a large amount of heterogeneity ( different findings ) between studies , a finding consistent with a lack of consensus on the issue .
despite this , statistical analysis of the studies they examined resulted in data that the increase in birth defects / relative risk ( rr ) from exposure to agent orange / dioxin " appears " to be on the order of *num* in vietnamese-funded studies , but *num* .
*num* in the rest of the world .
there is data near the threshold of statistical significance suggesting agent orange contributes to still-births , cleft palate , and neural tube defects , with spina bifida being the most statistically significant defect .
the large discrepancy in rr between vietnamese studies and those in the rest of the world has been ascribed to bias in the vietnamese studies .
it is estimated that about *num* , *num* vietnamese were killed by agent orange poisoning .
*num* of the former u .
s .
military bases in vietnam where the herbicides were stored and loaded onto airplanes may still have high levels of dioxins in the soil , posing a health threat to the surrounding communities .
extensive testing for dioxin contamination has been conducted at the former u .
s .
some of the soil and sediment on the bases have extremely high levels of dioxin requiring remediation .
the da nang air base has dioxin contamination up to *num* times higher than international recommendations for action .
the contaminated soil and sediment continue to affect the citizens of vietnam , poisoning their food chain and causing illnesses , serious skin diseases and a variety of cancers in the lungs , larynx , and prostate .
starting in the early 1990s , the federal government directed the institute of medicine ( iom ) , now known as the national academy of medicine , to issue reports every *num* years on the health effects of agent orange and similar herbicides .
first published in *num* and titled veterans and agent orange , the iom reports assess the risk of both cancer and non-cancer health effects .
each health effect is categorized by evidence of association based on available research data .
in the last update , titled veterans and agent orange : update *num* ( and published in *num* ) , the links between agent orange exposure and cancer were listed as shown .
( note that this table shows only cancers .
) other health effects are listed in the next section .
) soft tissue sarcoma ; non-hodgkin lymphoma ( nhl ) ; hodgkin disease ; chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( cll ) ; including hairy cell leukemia and other chronic b-cell leukemias respiratory cancers ( lung , bronchus , trachea , larynx ) ; prostate cancer ; multiple myeloma ; bladder cancer mouth , throat , and sinus cancers ; gastrointestinal cancers ( esophagus , stomach , pancreas , colon , rectum ) ; liver , gallbladder , and bile duct cancers ; bone and joint cancers ; skin cancers ; breast cancer ; female reproductive cancers ( cervical , ovarian , endometrial , uterine sarcoma ) ; testicular and penile cancers ; kidney cancer ; brain tumors ; cancers of endocrine glands ( thyroid , thymus , etc .
) ; leukemia ( other than cll and hairy cell leukemia ) ; cancers at all other sites cancer ( including leukemia ) in the children of veteran publications by the public health service have shown that vietnam veterans , overall , have increased rates of cancer , and nerve , digestive , skin , and respiratory disorders .
the center for disease control and prevention notes that in particular , there are higher rates of acute / chronic leukemia , hodgkin's lymphoma and non-hodgkin's lymphoma , throat cancer , prostate cancer , lung cancer , colon cancer , ischemic heart disease , soft tissue sarcoma and liver cancer .
with the exception of liver cancer , these are the same conditions the u .
s .
veterans administration has determined may be associated with exposure to agent orange / dioxin , and are on the list of conditions eligible for compensation and treatment .
military personnel who were involved in storage , mixture and transportation ( including aircraft mechanics ) , and actual use of the chemicals were probably among those who received the heaviest exposures .
military members who served on okinawa also claim to have been exposed to the chemical but there is no verifiable evidence to corroborate these claims .
some studies have suggested that veterans exposed to agent orange may be more at risk of developing prostate cancer and potentially more than twice as likely to develop higher-grade , more lethal prostate cancers .
however , a critical analysis of these studies and *num* others consistently found that there was no significant increase in prostate cancer incidence or mortality in those exposed to agent orange or *num* , *num* , *num* , 8-tetracholorodibenzo-"p"-dioxin , itself .
furthermore , the national academy of medicine ( nam , formerly the institute of medicine ( iom ) ) , which since *num* has been congressionally mandated to conduct a comprehensive evaluation every two years of any research and data related to the health outcomes associated with agent orange , has repeatedly concluded that any evidence suggestive of an association between agent orange and prostate cancer is , " limited because chance , bias , and confounding could not be ruled out with confidence .
" while in vietnam , the veterans were told not to worry , and were persuaded the chemical was harmless .
after returning home , vietnam veterans began to suspect their ill health or the instances of their wives having miscarriages or children born with birth defects might be related to agent orange and the other toxic herbicides to which they had been exposed in vietnam .
veterans began to file claims in *num* to the department of veterans affairs for disability payments for health care for conditions they believed were associated with exposure to agent orange , or more specifically , dioxin , but their claims were denied unless they could prove the condition began when they were in the service or within one year of their discharge .
in order to qualify for compensation , veterans must have served on or near the perimeters of military bases in thailand during the vietnam era , where herbicides were tested and stored outside of vietnam , veterans who were crew members on c-123 planes flown after the vietnam war , or were associated with department of defense ( dod ) projects to test , dispose of , or store herbicides in the u .
s .
by april *num* , the department of veterans affairs had compensated only *num* victims , although it had received disability claims from *num* , *num* soldiers who had been exposed to agent orange while serving in vietnam .
about *num* .
*num* percent——of the total forested area of vietnam was sprayed during the war , which disrupted the ecological equilibrium .
the persistent nature of dioxins , erosion caused by loss of tree cover , and loss of seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult ( or impossible ) in many areas .
many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species ( such as bamboo and cogon grass ) , making forest regeneration difficult and unlikely .
animal-species diversity was also impacted ; in one study a harvard biologist found *num* species of birds and five species of mammals in a sprayed forest , while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were *num* and *num* species of birds and *num* and *num* species of mammals .
dioxins from agent orange have persisted in the vietnamese environment since the war , settling in the soil and sediment and entering the food chain through animals and fish which feed in the contaminated areas .
the movement of dioxins through the food web has resulted in bioconcentration and biomagnification .
the areas most heavily contaminated with dioxins are former u .
s .
air bases .
american policy during the vietnam war was to destroy crops , accepting the sociopolitical impact that that would have .
the rand corporation's " memorandum 5446-isa / arpa " states : " the fact that the vc [ the vietcong ] obtain most of their food from the neutral rural population dictates the destruction of civilian crops .
.
.
if they are to be hampered by the crop destruction program , it will be necessary to destroy large portions of the rural economy – probably *num* % or more " .
crops were deliberately sprayed with agent orange , areas were bulldozed clear of vegetation , and the rural population was subjected to bombing and artillery fire .
in consequence , the urban population in south vietnam nearly tripled , growing from *num* .
*num* million people in *num* to *num* million by *num* .
the rapid flow of people led to a fast-paced and uncontrolled urbanization ; an estimated *num* .
*num* million people were living in saigon slums due to people moving to cities .
the extensive environmental damage that resulted from usage of the herbicide prompted the united nations to pass resolution *num* / *num* and ratify the environmental modification convention .
many states do not regard this as a complete ban on the use of herbicides and defoliants in warfare but it does require case-by-case consideration .
in the conference on disarmament , article *num* ( *num* ) protocol iii of the weaponry convention contains " the jungle exception " , which prohibits states from attacking forests or jungles " except if such natural elements are used to cover , conceal or camouflage combatants or military objectives or are military objectives themselves " .
this exception voids any protection of any military and civilian personnel from a napalm attack or something like agent orange and is clear that it was designed to cover situations like u .
s .
tactics in vietnam .
since at least *num* , several lawsuits have been filed against the companies which produced agent orange , among them dow chemical , monsanto , and diamond shamrock .
attorney hy mayerson was an early pioneer in agent orange litigation , working with environmental attorney victor yannacone in *num* on the first class-action suits against wartime manufacturers of agent orange .
in meeting dr .
ronald a .
codario , one of the first civilian doctors to see affected patients , mayerson , so impressed by the fact a physician would show so much interest in a vietnam veteran , forwarded more than a thousand pages of information on agent orange and the effects of dioxin on animals and humans to codario's office the day after he was first contacted by the doctor .
the corporate defendants sought to escape culpability by blaming everything on the u .
s .
government .
mayerson , with sgt .
charles e .
hartz as their principal client , filed the first us agent orange class-action lawsuit , in pennsylvania in *num* , for the injuries military personnel in vietnam suffered through exposure to toxic dioxins in the defoliant .
attorney mayerson co-wrote the brief that certified the agent orange product liability action as a class action , the largest ever filed as of its filing .
hartz's deposition was one of the first ever taken in america , and the first for an agent orange trial , for the purpose of preserving testimony at trial , as it was understood that hartz would not live to see the trial because of a brain tumor that began to develop while he was a member of tiger force , special forces , and lrrps in vietnam .
the firm also located and supplied critical research to the veterans ' lead expert , dr .
codario , including about *num* articles from toxicology journals dating back more than a decade , as well as data about where herbicides had been sprayed , what the effects of dioxin had been on animals and humans , and every accident in factories where herbicides were produced or dioxin was a contaminant of some chemical reaction .
the chemical companies involved denied that there was a link between agent orange and the veterans ' medical problems .
however , on may *num* , *num* , seven chemical companies settled the class-action suit out of court just hours before jury selection was to begin .
the companies agreed to pay $180 million as compensation if the veterans dropped all claims against them .
slightly over *num* % of the sum was ordered to be paid by monsanto alone .
many veterans who were victims of agent orange exposure were outraged the case had been settled instead of going to court , and felt they had been betrayed by the lawyers .
" fairness hearings " were held in five major american cities , where veterans and their families discussed their reactions to the settlement , and condemned the actions of the lawyers and courts , demanding the case be heard before a jury of their peers .
federal judge jack b .
weinstein refused the appeals , claiming the settlement was " fair and just " .
by *num* , the veterans ' fears were confirmed when it was decided how the money from the settlement would be paid out .
a totally disabled vietnam veteran would receive a maximum of $12 , *num* spread out over the course of *num* years .
furthermore , by accepting the settlement payments , disabled veterans would become ineligible for many state benefits that provided far more monetary support than the settlement , such as food stamps , public assistance , and government pensions .
a widow of a vietnam veteran who died of agent orange exposure would only receive $3700 .
in *num* , monsanto spokesman jill montgomery said monsanto should not be liable at all for injuries or deaths caused by agent orange , saying : " we are sympathetic with people who believe they have been injured and understand their concern to find the cause , but reliable scientific evidence indicates that agent orange is not the cause of serious long-term health effects .
" in *num* , new jersey created the new jersey agent orange commission , the first state commission created to study its effects .
the commission's research project in association with rutgers university was called " the pointman project " .
it was disbanded by governor christine todd whitman in *num* .
during pointman i , commission researchers devised ways to determine small dioxin levels in blood .
prior to this , such levels could only be found in the adipose ( fat ) tissue .
the project studied dioxin ( tcdd ) levels in blood as well as in adipose tissue in a small group of vietnam veterans who had been exposed to agent orange and compared them to those of a matched control group ; the levels were found to be higher in the former group .
the second phase of the project continued to examine and compare dioxin levels in various groups of vietnam veterans , including army , marines and brown water riverboat navy personnel .
in *num* , congress enacted the agent orange act , giving the department of veterans affairs the authority to declare certain conditions " presumptive " to exposure to agent orange / dioxin , making these veterans who served in vietnam eligible to receive treatment and compensation for these conditions .
the same law required the national academy of sciences to periodically review the science on dioxin and herbicides used in vietnam to inform the secretary of veterans affairs about the strength of the scientific evidence showing association between exposure to agent orange / dioxin and certain conditions .
the authority for the national academy of sciences reviews and addition of any new diseases to the presumptive list by the va is expiring in *num* under the sunset clause of the agent orange act of *num* .
through this process , the list of ' presumptive ' conditions has grown since *num* , and currently the u .
s .
department of veterans affairs has listed prostate cancer , respiratory cancers , multiple myeloma , type ii diabetes mellitus , hodgkin's disease , non-hodgkin's lymphoma , soft tissue sarcoma , chloracne , porphyria cutanea tarda , peripheral neuropathy , chronic lymphocytic leukemia , and spina bifida in children of veterans exposed to agent orange as conditions associated with exposure to the herbicide .
this list now includes b cell leukemias , such as hairy cell leukemia , parkinson's disease and ischemic heart disease , these last three having been added on august *num* , *num* .
several highly placed individuals in government are voicing concerns about whether some of the diseases on the list should , in fact , actually have been included .
in *num* , an appraisal of the *num* year long " air force health study " that began in *num* indicates that the results of the afhs as they pertain to agent orange , do not provide evidence of disease in the ranch hand veterans due to " their elevated levels of exposure to agent orange " .
the va denied the applications of post-vietnam c-123 aircrew veterans because as veterans without " boots on the ground " service in vietnam , they were not covered under va's interpretation of " exposed " .
at the request of the va , the institute of medicine evaluated whether or not service in these c-123 aircraft could have plausibly exposed soldiers and been detrimental to their health .
their report " post-vietnam dioxin exposure in agent orange-contaminated c-123 aircraft " confirmed it .
in june *num* the secretary of veterans affairs issued an interim final rule providing presumptive service connection for post-vietnam c-123 aircrews , maintenance staff and aeromedical evacuation crews .
va now provides medical care and disability compensation for the recognized list of agent orange illnesses .
in *num* , vietnam and the u .
s .
held a joint conference on human health and environmental impacts of agent orange .
following the conference , the u .
s .
national institute of environmental health sciences ( niehs ) began scientific exchanges between the u .
s .
and vietnam , and began discussions for a joint research project on the human health impacts of agent orange .
these negotiations broke down in *num* , when neither side could agree on the research protocol and the research project was canceled .
more progress has been made on the environmental front .
in *num* , the first u .
s .
-vietnam workshop on remediation of dioxin was held .
starting in *num* , the u .
s .
environmental protection agency ( epa ) began to work with the vietnamese government to measure the level of dioxin at the da nang air base .
also in *num* , the joint advisory committee on agent orange , made up of representatives of vietnamese and u .
s .
government agencies , was established .
the committee has been meeting yearly to explore areas of scientific cooperation , technical assistance and environmental remediation of dioxin .
a breakthrough in the diplomatic stalemate on this issue occurred as a result of united states president george w .
bush's state visit to vietnam in november *num* .
in the joint statement , president bush and president triet agreed " further joint efforts to address the environmental contamination near former dioxin storage sites would make a valuable contribution to the continued development of their bilateral relationship .
" on may *num* , *num* , president bush signed the u .
s .
troop readiness , veterans ' care , katrina recovery , and iraq accountability appropriations act , *num* into law for the wars in iraq and afghanistan that included an earmark of $3 million specifically for funding for programs for the remediation of dioxin ' hotspots ' on former u .
s .
military bases , and for public health programs for the surrounding communities ; some authors consider this to be completely inadequate , pointing out that the u .
s .
airbase in da nang , alone , will cost $14 million to clean up , and that three others are estimated to require $60 million for cleanup .
the appropriation was renewed in the fiscal year *num* and again in fy *num* .
an additional $12 million was appropriated in the fiscal year *num* in the supplemental appropriations act and a total of $18 .
*num* million appropriated for fiscal year *num* .
secretary of state hillary clinton stated during a visit to hanoi in october *num* that the u .
s .
government would begin work on the clean-up of dioxin contamination at the da nang airbase .
in june *num* , a ceremony was held at da nang airport to mark the start of u .
s .
-funded decontamination of dioxin hotspots in vietnam .
thirty-two million dollars has so far been allocated by the u .
s .
congress to fund the program .
a $43 million project began in the summer of *num* , as vietnam and the u .
s .
forge closer ties to boost trade and counter china's rising influence in the disputed south china sea .
on january *num* , *num* , a victim's rights group , the vietnam association for victims of agent orange / dioxin ( vava ) , filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york in brooklyn , against several u .
s .
companies for liability in causing personal injury , by developing , and producing the chemical , and claimed that the use of agent orange violated the *num* hague convention on land warfare , *num* geneva protocol , and the *num* geneva conventions .
dow chemical and monsanto were the two largest producers of agent orange for the u .
s .
military , and were named in the suit , along with the dozens of other companies ( diamond shamrock , uniroyal , thompson chemicals , hercules , etc .
) .
on march *num* , *num* , judge jack b .
weinstein of the eastern district – who had presided over the *num* u .
s .
veterans class-action lawsuit – dismissed the lawsuit , ruling there was no legal basis for the plaintiffs ' claims .
he concluded agent orange was not considered a poison under international law at the time of its use by the u .
s .
; the u .
s .
was not prohibited from using it as a herbicide ; and the companies which produced the substance were not liable for the method of its use by the government .
weinstein used the british example to help dismiss the claims of people exposed to agent orange in their suit against the chemical companies that had supplied it .
george jackson stated that " if the americans were guilty of war crimes for using agent orange in vietnam , then the british would be also guilty of war crimes as well since they were the first nation to deploy the use of herbicides and defoliants in warfare and used them on a large scale throughout the malayan emergency .
not only was there no outcry by other states in response to britain's use , but the u .
s .
viewed it as establishing a precedent for the use of herbicides and defoliants in jungle warfare .
" the u .
s .
government was also not a party in the lawsuit , due to sovereign immunity , and the court ruled the chemical companies , as contractors of the u .
s .
government , shared the same immunity .
the case was appealed and heard by the second circuit court of appeals in manhattan on june *num* , *num* .
three judges on the second circuit court of appeals upheld weinstein's ruling to dismiss the case .
they ruled that , though the herbicides contained a dioxin ( a known poison ) , they were not intended to be used as a poison on humans .
therefore , they were not considered a chemical weapon and thus not a violation of international law .
a further review of the case by the whole panel of judges of the court of appeals also confirmed this decision .
the lawyers for the vietnamese filed a petition to the u .
s .
supreme court to hear the case .
on march *num* , *num* , the supreme court denied certiorari and refused to reconsider the ruling of the court of appeals .
in a november *num* zogby international poll of *num* people , *num* % of respondents thought the u .
s .
chemical companies which produced agent orange defoliant should compensate u .
s .
soldiers who were affected by the toxic chemical used during the war in vietnam .
also , *num* % said they supported compensation for vietnamese agent orange victims .
to assist those who have been affected by agent orange / dioxin , the vietnamese have established " peace villages " , which each host between *num* and *num* victims , giving them medical and psychological help .
as of *num* , there were *num* such villages , thus granting some social protection to fewer than a thousand victims .
u .
s .
veterans of the war in vietnam and individuals who are aware and sympathetic to the impacts of agent orange have supported these programs in vietnam .
an international group of veterans from the u .
s .
and its allies during the vietnam war working with their former enemy—veterans from the vietnam veterans association—established the vietnam friendship village outside of hanoi .
the center provides medical care , rehabilitation and vocational training for children and veterans from vietnam who have been affected by agent orange .
in *num* , the vietnam red cross established the vietnam agent orange victims fund to provide direct assistance to families throughout vietnam that have been affected .
in *num* , the vietnam association of victims of agent orange ( vava ) was formed .
in addition to filing the lawsuit against the chemical companies , vava provides medical care , rehabilitation services and financial assistance to those injured by agent orange .
the vietnamese government provides small monthly stipends to more than *num* , *num* vietnamese believed affected by the herbicides ; this totaled $40 .
*num* million in *num* alone .
the vietnam red cross has raised more than $22 million to assist the ill or disabled , and several u .
s .
foundations , united nations agencies , european governments and nongovernmental organizations have given a total of about $23 million for site cleanup , reforestation , health care and other services to those in need .
vuong mo of the vietnam news agency described one of the centers : may is *num* , but she knows nothing , is unable to talk fluently , nor walk with ease due to for her bandy legs .
her father is dead and she has four elder brothers , all mentally retarded .
.
.
the students are all disabled , retarded and of different ages .
teaching them is a hard job .
they are of the *ord* grade but many of them find it hard to do the reading .
only a few of them can .
their pronunciation is distorted due to their twisted lips and their memory is quite short .
they easily forget what they've learned .
.
.
in the village , it is quite hard to tell the kids ' exact ages .
some in their twenties have a physical statures as small as the 7- or 8-years-old .
they find it difficult to feed themselves , much less have mental ability or physical capacity for work .
no one can hold back the tears when seeing the heads turning round unconsciously , the bandy arms managing to push the spoon of food into the mouths with awful difficulty .
.
.
yet they still keep smiling , singing in their great innocence , at the presence of some visitors , craving for something beautiful .
on june *num* , *num* , members of the u .
s .
-vietnam dialogue group on agent orange / dioxin unveiled a comprehensive 10-year declaration and plan of action to address the toxic legacy of agent orange and other herbicides in vietnam .
the plan of action was released as an aspen institute publication and calls upon the u .
s .
and vietnamese governments to join with other governments , foundations , businesses , and nonprofits in a partnership to clean up dioxin " hot spots " in vietnam and to expand humanitarian services for people with disabilities there .
on september *num* , *num* , senator patrick leahy ( d-vt ) acknowledged the work of the dialogue group by releasing a statement on the floor of the united states senate .
the statement urges the u .
s .
government to take the plan of action's recommendations into account in developing a multi-year plan of activities to address the agent orange / dioxin legacy .
in *num* , australian researcher jean williams claimed that cancer rates in the town of innisfail , queensland were *num* times higher than the state average due to secret testing of agent orange by the australian military scientists during the vietnam war .
williams , who had won the order of australia medal for her research on the effects of chemicals on u .
s .
war veterans , based her allegations on australian government reports found in the australian war memorial's archives .
a former soldier , ted bosworth , backed up the claims , saying that he had been involved in the secret testing .
neither williams or bosworth have produced verifiable evidence to support their claims .
the queensland health department determined that cancer rates in innisfail were no higher than those in other parts of the state .
the brazilian government in the late 1960s used herbicides to defoliate a large section of the amazon rainforest so that alcoa could build the tucuruí dam to power mining operations .
large areas of rainforest were destroyed , along with the homes and livelihoods of thousands of rural peasants and indigenous tribes .
agent orange was used as a defoliant in eastern cambodia during the vietnam war , but its impacts are difficult to assess due to the chaos caused by the khmer rouge regime .
the u .
s .
military , with the permission of the canadian government , tested herbicides , including agent orange , in the forests near the canadian forces base gagetown in new brunswick .
in *num* , the government of canada offered a one-time ex gratia payment of $20 , *num* as compensation for agent orange exposure at cfb gagetown .
on july *num* , *num* , merchant law group llp on behalf of over *num* , *num* canadian veterans and civilians who were living in and around the cfb gagetown filed a lawsuit to pursue class action litigation concerning agent orange and agent purple with the federal court of canada .
on august *num* , *num* , the case was rejected by the court due to lack of evidence .
the ruling was appealed .
in *num* , the canadian government announced that a research and fact-finding program initiated in *num* had found the base was safe .
on february *num* , *num* , the " toronto star " revealed that agent orange was employed to clear extensive plots of crown land in northern ontario .
the " toronto star " reported that , " records from the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s show forestry workers , often students and junior rangers , spent weeks at a time as human markers holding red , helium-filled balloons on fishing lines while low-flying planes sprayed toxic herbicides including an infamous chemical mixture known as agent orange on the brush and the boys below .
" in response to the " toronto star " article , the ontario provincial government launched a probe into the use of agent orange .
an analysis of chemicals present in the island's soil , together with resolutions passed by guam's legislature , suggest that agent orange was among the herbicides routinely used on and around military bases anderson air force base , naval air station agana , guam .
despite the evidence , the department of defense continues to deny that agent orange was ever stored or used on guam .
several guam veterans have collected an enormous amount of evidence to assist in their disability claims for direct exposure to dioxin containing herbicides such as *num* , *num* , 5-t which are similar to the illness associations and disability coverage that has become standard for those who were harmed by the same chemical contaminant of agent orange used in vietnam .
agent orange was used in korea in the late 1960s .
the united states local press kpho-tv in phoenix , arizona , alleged ( in *num* ) that the united states army had in *num* buried *num* drums of agent orange in camp carroll , the u .
s .
army base in gyeongsangbuk-do , korea .
in *num* , about *num* , *num* south koreans filed two separated lawsuits against u .
s .
companies , seeking more than $5 billion in damages .
after losing a decision in *num* , they filed an appeal .
in january *num* , the south korean appeals court ordered dow chemical and monsanto to pay $62 million in compensation to about *num* , *num* people .
the ruling acknowledged that " the defendants failed to ensure safety as the defoliants manufactured by the defendants had higher levels of dioxins than standard " , and , quoting the u .
s .
national academy of science report , declared that there was a " causal relationship " between agent orange and a range of diseases , including several cancers .
the judges failed to acknowledge " the relationship between the chemical and peripheral neuropathy , the disease most widespread among agent orange victims " .
currently , veterans who provide evidence meeting va requirements for service in vietnam , and who can medically establish that anytime after this ' presumptive exposure ' they developed any medical problems on the list of presumptive diseases , may receive compensation from the va .
certain veterans who served in korea and are able to prove they were assigned to certain specified around the dmz during a specific time frame are afforded similar presumption .
parts of laos were sprayed with agent orange during the vietnam war .
the use of agent orange has been controversial in new zealand , because of the exposure of new zealand troops in vietnam and because of the production of agent orange for vietnam and other users at an ivon watkins-dow chemical plant in paritutu , new plymouth .
there have been continuing claims , as yet unproven , that the suburb of paritutu has also been polluted ; see new zealand in the vietnam war .
there are cases of new zealand soldiers developing cancers such as bone cancer but none has been scientifically connected to exposure to herbicides .
herbicide persistence studies of agents orange and white were conducted in the philippines .
the u .
s .
air force operation to remove herbicide orange from vietnam in *num* was named operation pacer ivy , while the operation to destroy the agent orange stored at johnston atoll in *num* was named operation pacer ho .
operation pacer ivy ( inventory ) collected agent orange in south vietnam and removed it in *num* aboard the ship for storage on johnston atoll .
the environmental protection agency ( epa ) reports that of herbicide orange was stored at johnston island in the pacific and at gulfport in mississippi .
research and studies were initiated to find a safe method to destroy the materials and it was discovered they could be incinerated safely under special conditions of temperature and dwell time .
however , these herbicides were expensive and the air force wanted to resell its surplus instead of dumping it at sea .
among many methods tested , a possibility of salvaging the herbicides by reprocessing and filtering out the *num* , *num* , *num* , 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( tcdd ) contaminant with carbonized ( charcoaled ) coconut fibers .
this concept was then tested in *num* and a pilot plant constructed at gulfport .
from july to september *num* during operation pacer ho ( herbicide orange ) , the entire stock of agent orange from both herbicide orange storage sites at gulfport and johnston atoll was subsequently incinerated in four separate burns in the vicinity of johnston island aboard the dutch-owned waste incineration ship .
as of *num* , some records of the storage and disposition of agent orange at johnston atoll have been associated with the historical records of operation red hat .
there have been dozens of reports in the press about use and / or storage of military formulated herbicides on okinawa that are based upon statements by former u .
s .
service members that had been stationed on the island , photographs , government records , and unearthed storage barrels .
the u .
s .
department of defense ( dod ) has denied these allegations with statements by military officials and spokespersons , as well as a january *num* report authored by dr .
alvin young that was released in april *num* .
in particular , the *num* report refuted articles written by journalist jon mitchell as well as a statement from " an ecological assessment of johnston atoll " a *num* publication produced by the united states army chemical materials agency that states , " in *num* , the u .
s .
air force also brought about *num* , *num* 200l drums of the chemical , herbicide orange ( ho ) to johnston island that originated from vietnam and was stored on okinawa .
" the *num* report stated : " the authors of the [ *num* ] report were not dod employees , nor were they likely familiar with the issues surrounding herbicide orange or its actual history of transport to the island .
" and detailed the transport phases and routes of agent orange from vietnam to johnston atoll , none of which included okinawa .
further official confirmation of restricted ( dioxin containing ) herbicide storage on okinawa appeared in a *num* fort detrick report titled " historical , logistical , political and technical aspects of the herbicide / defoliant program " , which mentioned that the environmental statement should consider " herbicide stockpiles elsewhere in pacom ( pacific command ) u .
s .
government restricted materials thailand and okinawa ( kadena afb ) .
" the *num* dod report says that the environmental statement urged by the *num* report was published in *num* as " the department of air force final environmental statement " , and that the latter did not find agent orange was held in either thailand or okinawa .
agent orange was tested by the united states in thailand during the war in southeast asia .
buried drums were uncovered and confirmed to be agent orange in *num* .
workers who uncovered the drums fell ill while upgrading the airport near hua hin district , *num* km south of bangkok .
vietnam-era veterans whose service involved duty on or near the perimeters of military bases in thailand anytime between february *num* , *num* , and may *num* , *num* , may have been exposed to herbicides and may qualify for va benefits .
a declassified department of defense report written in *num* , suggests that there was a significant use of herbicides on the fenced-in perimeters of military bases in thailand to remove foliage that provided cover for enemy forces .
in *num* , va determined that herbicides used on the thailand base perimeters may have been tactical and procured from vietnam , or a strong , commercial type resembling tactical herbicides .
the university of hawaii has acknowledged extensive testing of agent orange on behalf of the united states department of defense in hawaii along with mixtures of agent orange on kaua'i island in 1967–68 and on hawaii island in *num* ; testing and storage in other u .
s .
locations has been documented by the united states department of veterans affairs .
in *num* , the c-123 aircraft used for spraying agent orange were returned to the united states and assigned various east coast usaf reserve squadrons , and then employed in traditional airlift missions between *num* and *num* .
in *num* , testing by the air force identified some former spray aircraft as " heavily contaminated " with dioxin residue .
inquiries by aircrew veterans in *num* brought a decision by the u .
s .
department of veterans affairs opining that not enough dioxin residue remained to injure these post-vietnam war veterans .
on *num* january *num* , the u .
s .
center for disease control's agency for toxic substances and disease registry challenged this with their finding that former spray aircraft were indeed contaminated and the aircrews exposed to harmful levels of dioxin .
in response to veterans ' concerns , the va in february *num* referred the c-123 issue to the institute of medicine for a special study , with results released on january *num* , *num* .
in *num* , the u .
s .
environmental protection agency suspended spraying of agent orange in national forests .
a december *num* department of defense report listed agent orange testing , storage , and disposal sites at *num* locations throughout the united states , as well as in canada , thailand , puerto rico , korea , and in the pacific ocean .
the veteran administration has also acknowledged that agent orange was used domestically by u .
s .
forces in test sites throughout the united states .
eglin air force base in florida was one of the primary testing sites throughout the 1960s .
in february *num* , monsanto agreed to settle a case covering dioxin contamination around a plant in nitro , west virginia , that had manufactured agent orange .
monsanto agreed to pay up to $9 million for cleanup of affected homes , $84 million for medical monitoring of people affected , and the community's legal fees .
on *num* august *num* , the united states and vietnam began a cooperative cleaning up of the toxic chemical on part of danang international airport , marking the first time washington has been involved in cleaning up agent orange in vietnam .
danang was the primary storage site of the chemical .
two other cleanup sites the united states and vietnam are looking at is biên hòa , in the southern province of đồng nai—a " hotspot " for dioxin—and phù cát airport in the central province of bình định , says u .
s .
ambassador to vietnam david shear .
according to the vietnamese newspaper " nhân dân " , the u .
s .
government provided $41 million to the project , which will reduce the contamination level in *num* , *num* cubic meters of soil by late *num* .
some *num* , *num* cubic meters were " cleaned " , an equal amount began in october *num* scheduled for completion in mid *num* .
the seabee's naval construction battalion center at gulfport , mississippi was the largest storage site in the united states for agent orange .
it was *num* odd acres in size and was still being cleaned up in *num* .
due to the fact that destruction requires high temperatures ( over *num* °c ) , the destruction process is energy intensive .
exothermic process in thermodynamics , the term exothermic process ( exo- : " outside " ) describes a process or reaction that releases energy from the system to its surroundings , usually in the form of heat , but also in a form of light ( e .
g .
a spark , flame , or flash ) , electricity ( e .
g .
a battery ) , or sound ( e .
g .
explosion heard when burning hydrogen ) .
its etymology stems from the greek prefix " έξω " ( exō , which means " outwards " ) and the greek word " θερμικός " ( thermikόs , which means " thermal " ) .
the term " exothermic " was first coined by marcellin berthelot .
the opposite of an exothermic process is an endothermic process , one that absorbs energy in the form of heat .
the concept is frequently applied in the physical sciences to chemical reactions , where as in chemical bond energy that will be converted to thermal energy ( heat ) .
exothermic ( and endothermic ) describe two types of chemical reactions or systems found in nature , as follows .
simply stated , after an exothermic reaction , more energy has been released to the surroundings than was absorbed to initiate and maintain the reaction .
an example would be the burning of a candle , wherein the sum of calories produced by combustion ( found by looking at radiant heating of the surroundings and visible light produced , including increase in temperature of the fuel ( wax ) itself , which with oxygen , have become hot co and water vapor , ) exceeds the number of calories absorbed initially in lighting the flame and in the flame maintaining itself .
( i .
e .
some energy produced by combustion is reabsorbed and used in melting , then vaporizing the wax , etc .
but is ( far ) outstripped by the energy produced in breaking carbon-hydrogen bonds and combination of oxygen with the resulting carbon and hydrogen ) .
on the other hand , in an endothermic reaction or system , energy is taken from the surroundings in the course of the reaction .
an example of an endothermic reaction is a first aid cold pack , in which the reaction of two chemicals , or dissolving of one in another , requires calories from the surroundings , and the reaction cools the pouch and surroundings by absorbing heat from them .
an endothermic system is seen in the production of wood : trees absorb radiant energy , from the sun , use it in endothermic reactions such as taking apart co and ho and combining the carbon and hydrogen generated to produce cellulose and other organic chemicals .
these products , in the form of wood , say , may later be burned in a fireplace , exothermically , producing co and water , and releasing energy in the form of heat and light to their surroundings , e .
g .
, to a home's interior and chimney gasses .
exothermic refers to a transformation in which a system releases energy ( heat ) to the surroundings , expressed by when the transformation occurs at constant pressure , one has for the enthalpy and constant volume , one has for the internal energy in an adiabatic system ( i .
e .
a system that does not exchange heat with the surroundings ) , an exothermic process results in an increase in temperature of the system .
in exothermic chemical reactions , the heat that is released by the reaction takes the form of electromagnetic energy .
the transition of electrons from one quantum energy level to another causes light to be released .
this light is equivalent in energy to the stabilization energy of the energy for the chemical reaction , i .
e .
the bond energy .
this light that is released can be absorbed by other molecules in solution to give rise to molecular vibrations or rotytions , which gives rise to the classical understanding of heat .
in contrast , when endothermic reactions occur , energy is absorbed to place an electron in a higher energy state , such that the electron can associate with another atom to form a chemical complex .
net energy is absorbed by an endothermic reaction .
in an exothermic reaction , the energy needed to start the reaction is less than el energy that is subsequently released , so there is a net release of energy .
this is the physical understanding of exothermic and endothermic reactions .
some examples of exothermic processes are : chemical exothermic reactions are generally more spontaneous than their counterparts , endothermic reactions .
in a thermochemical reaction that is exothermic , the heat may be listed among the products of the reaction .
because of historical accident , students encounter a source of possible confusion between the terminology of physics and biology .
whereas the thermodynamic terms " exothermic " and " endothermic " respectively refer to processes that give out heat energy and processes that absorb heat energy , in biology the sense is effectively inverted .
the metabolic terms " ectothermic " and " endothermic " respectively refer to organisms that rely largely on external heat to achieve a full working temperature , and to organisms that produce heat from within as a major factor in controlling their bodily temperature .
euphoria ( disambiguation ) euphoria is an emotional and mental state defined as a sense of great elation and well being .
botswana botswana ( ) , officially the republic of botswana ( ) , is a landlocked country in southern africa .
formerly the british protectorate of bechuanaland , botswana adopted its new name after becoming independent within the commonwealth on *num* september *num* .
since then , they maintain a tradition of stable representative republic , with a consistent record of uninterrupted democratic elections and the best perceived corruption ranking in africa since at least *num* .
it is currently africa's oldest continuous democracy .
botswana is topographically flat , with up to *num* percent of its territory being the kalahari desert .
it is bordered by south africa to the south and southeast , namibia to the west and north , and zimbabwe to the northeast .
its border with zambia to the north near kazungula is poorly defined but is , at most , a few hundred metres long .
a mid-sized country of just over *num* million people , botswana is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world .
around *num* percent of the population lives in the capital and largest city , gaborone .
formerly one of the poorest countries in the world—with a gdp per capita of about us$70 per year in the late 1960s—botswana has since transformed itself into one of the world's fastest-growing economies .
the economy is dominated by mining , cattle , and tourism .
botswana boasts a gdp ( purchasing power parity ) per capita of about $18 , *num* per year , which is one of the highest in africa .
its high gross national income ( by some estimates the fourth-largest in africa ) gives the country a relatively high standard of living and the highest human development index of continental sub-saharan africa .
botswana is a member of the african union , the southern african development community , the commonwealth of nations , and the united nations .
the country has been among the hardest hit by the hiv / aids epidemic .
despite the success in programmes to make treatments available to those infected , and to educate the populace in general about how to stop the spread of hiv / aids , the number of people with aids rose from *num* , *num* in *num* to *num* , *num* in *num* .
, botswana has the third-highest prevalence rate for hiv / aids , with roughly *num* % of the population infected .
the country's name means " land of the tswana " , referring to the dominant ethnic group in botswana .
the term " batswana " was originally applied to the tswana , which is still the case .
however , it has also come to be used generally as a demonym for all citizens of botswana .
many english dictionaries also recommend the term " botswanan " to refer to people of botswana .
archaeological digs have shown that hominids have lived in botswana for around two million years .
stone tools and fauna remains have shown that all areas of the country were inhabited at least *num* , *num* years ago .
evidence left by modern humans such as cave paintings are about *num* , *num* years old .
the original inhabitants of southern africa were the bushmen ( san ) and khoi peoples .
both speak khoisan languages and hunted , gathered , and traded over long distances .
when cattle were first introduced about *num* years ago into southern africa , pastoralism became a major feature of the economy , since the region had large grasslands free of tsetse fly .
it is unclear when bantu-speaking peoples first moved into the country from the north , although ad *num* seems to be a consensus estimate .
in that era , the ancestors of the modern-day kalanga moved into what is now the north-eastern areas of the country .
these proto-kalanga were closely connected to states in zimbabwe as well as to the mapungubwe state .
these states , located outside of current botswana's borders , appear to have kept massive cattle herds in what is now the central district—apparently at numbers approaching modern cattle density .
this massive cattle-raising complex prospered until *num* ad or so , and seems to have regressed following the collapse of mapungubwe .
during this era , the first tswana-speaking groups , the bakgalagadi , moved into the southern areas of the kalahari .
all these various peoples were connected to trade routes that ran via the limpopo river to the indian ocean , and trade goods from asia such as beads made their way to botswana most likely in exchange for ivory , gold , and rhinoceros horn .
the arrival of the ancestors of the tswana-speakers who came to control the region has yet to be dated precisely .
members of the bakwena , a chieftaincy under a legendary leader named kgabo ii , made their way into the southern kalahari by ad *num* , at the latest , and his people drove the bakgalagadi inhabitants west into the desert .
over the years , several offshoots of the bakwena moved into adjoining territories .
the bangwaketse occupied areas to the west , while the bangwato moved northeast into formerly kalanga areas .
not long afterwards , a bangwato offshoot known as the batawana migrated into the okavango delta , probably in the 1790s .
the first written records relating to modern-day botswana appear in *num* .
what these records show is that the bangwaketse had become the predominant power in the region .
under the rule of makaba ii , the bangwaketse kept vast herds of cattle in well-protected desert areas , and used their military prowess to raid their neighbors .
other chiefdoms in the area , by this time , had capitals of *num* , *num* or so and were fairly prosperous .
this equilibrium came to end during the mfecane period , 1823–1843 , when a succession of invading peoples from south africa entered the country .
although the bangwaketse were able to defeat the invading bakololo in *num* , over time all the major chiefdoms in botswana were attacked , weakened , and impoverished .
the bakololo and amandebele raided repeatedly , and took large numbers of cattle , women , and children from the batswana—most of whom were driven into the desert or sanctuary areas such as hilltops and caves .
only after *num* , when the amandebele moved into western zimbabwe , did this threat subside .
during the 1840s and 1850s trade with cape colony-based merchants opened up and enabled the batswana chiefdoms to rebuild .
the bakwena , bangwaketse , bangwato and batawana cooperated to control the lucrative ivory trade , and then used the proceeds to import horses and guns , which in turn enabled them to establish control over what is now botswana .
this process was largely complete by *num* , and thus the bushmen , the kalanga , the bakgalagadi , and other current minorities were subjugated by the batswana .
following the great trek , afrikaners from the cape colony established themselves on the borders of botswana in the transvaal .
in *num* a coalition of tswana chiefdoms led by sechele i resisted afrikaner incursions , and after about eight years of intermittent tensions and hostilities , eventually came to a peace agreement in potchefstroom in *num* .
from that point on , the modern-day border between south africa and botswana was agreed on , and the afrikaners and batswana traded and worked together peacefully .
due to newly peaceful conditions , trade thrived between *num* and *num* .
taking advantage of this were christian missionaries .
the lutherans and the london missionary society both became established in the country by *num* .
by *num* every major village had a resident missionary , and their influence slowly became felt .
khama iii ( reigned 1875–1923 ) was the first of the tswana chiefs to make christianity a state religion , and changed a great deal of tswana customary law as a result .
christianity became the de facto official religion in all the chiefdoms by world war i .
during the scramble for africa the territory of botswana was coveted by both germany and great britain .
during the berlin conference , britain decided to annex botswana in order to safeguard the road to the north and thus connect the cape colony to its territories further north .
it unilaterally annexed tswana territories in january *num* and then sent the warren expedition north to consolidate control over the area and convince the chiefs to accept british overrule .
despite their misgivings , they eventually acquiesced to this fait accompli .
in *num* areas north of *num* degrees were added to the new bechuanaland protectorate .
during the 1890s the new territory was divided into eight different reserves , with fairly small amounts of land being left as freehold for white settlers .
during the early 1890s , the british government decided to hand over the bechuanaland protectorate to the british south africa company .
this plan , which was well on its way to fruition despite the entreaties of tswana leaders who toured england in protest , was eventually foiled by the failure of the jameson raid in january *num* .
when the union of south africa was formed in *num* from the main british colonies in the region , the high commission territories — the bechuanaland protectorate , basutoland ( now lesotho ) , and swaziland ( now eswatini ) — were not included , but provision was made for their later incorporation .
however , the uk began to consult with their inhabitants as to their wishes .
although successive south african governments sought to have the territories transferred to their jurisdiction , the uk kept delaying ; consequently , it never occurred .
the election of the nationalist government in *num* , which instituted apartheid , and south africa's withdrawal from the commonwealth in *num* , ended any prospect of the uk or these territories agreeing to incorporation into south africa .
an expansion of british central authority and the evolution of tribal government resulted in the *num* establishment of two advisory councils to represent both africans and europeans .
the african council consisted of the eight heads of the tswana tribes and some elected members .
proclamations in *num* regulated tribal rule and powers .
a european-african advisory council was formed in *num* , and the *num* constitution established a consultative legislative council .
in june *num* , the united kingdom accepted proposals for a democratic self-government in botswana .
the seat of government was moved in *num* from mafikeng in south africa , to the newly established gaborone , which is located near botswana's border with south africa .
based on the *num* constitution , the country held its first general elections under universal suffrage and gained independence on *num* september *num* .
seretse khama , a leader in the independence movement and the legitimate claimant to the ngwato chiefship , was elected as the first president , and subsequently re-elected twice .
the presidency passed to the sitting vice-president , quett masire , who was elected in his own right in *num* and re-elected in *num* and *num* .
masire retired from office in *num* .
he was succeeded by festus mogae , who was elected in his own right in *num* and re-elected in *num* .
the presidency passed in *num* to ian khama ( son of the first president ) , who had been serving as mogae's vice-president since resigning his position in *num* as commander of the botswana defence force to take up this civilian role .
a long-running dispute over the northern border with namibia's caprivi strip was the subject of a ruling by the international court of justice in december *num* .
it ruled that kasikili island belongs to botswana .
at botswana is the world's *ord* country .
it is similar in size to madagascar or france .
it lies between latitudes 17° and 27°s , and longitudes 20° and 30°e .
the country is predominantly flat , tending toward gently rolling tableland .
botswana is dominated by the kalahari desert , which covers up to *num* % of its land surface .
the okavango delta , one of the world's largest inland deltas , is in the northwest .
the makgadikgadi pan , a large salt pan , lies in the north .
the limpopo river basin , the major landform of all of southern africa , lies partly in botswana , with the basins of its tributaries , the notwane , bonwapitse , mahalapye , lotsane , motloutse and the shashe , located in the eastern part of the country .
the notwane provides water to the capital through the gaborone dam .
the chode river lies to the north , providing a boundary between botswana and namibia's zambezi region .
the chode river meets with the zambezi river at a place called kazungula ( meaning a small sausage tree , a point where sebitwane and his makololo tribe crossed the zambezi into zambia ) .
botswana has diverse areas of wildlife habitat .
in addition to the delta and desert areas , there are grasslands and savannas , where blue wildebeest , antelopes , and other mammals and birds are found .
northern botswana has one of the few remaining large populations of the endangered african wild dog .
chode national park , found in the chode district , has the world's largest concentration of african elephants .
the park covers about and supports about *num* species of birds .
the chode national park and moremi game reserve ( in the okavango delta ) are major tourist destinations .
other reserves include the central kalahari game reserve located in the kalahari desert in ghanzi district ; makgadikgadi pans national park and nxai pan national park are in central district in the makgadikgadi pan .
mashatu game reserve is privately owned : located where the shashe river and limpopo river meet in eastern botswana .
the other privately owned reserve is mokolodi nature reserve near gaborone .
there are also specialised sanctuaries like khama rhino sanctuary ( for rhinoceros ) and makgadikgadi sanctuary ( for flamingos ) .
they are both located in central district .
botswana faces two major environmental problems : drought and desertification .
the desertification problems predominantly stem from the severe times of drought in the country .
three quarters of the country's human and animal populations depend on groundwater due to drought .
groundwater use through deep borehole drilling has somewhat eased the effects of drought .
surface water is scarce in botswana and less than *num* % of the agriculture in the country is sustainable by rainfall .
in the remaining *num* % of the country , raising livestock is the primary source of rural income .
approximately *num* % of the country's land is used for communal grazing , which has been a major cause of the desertification and the accelerating soil erosion of the country .
since raising livestock has proven to be profitable for the people of botswana , they continue to exploit the land .
the animal populations have continued to dramatically increase .
from *num* to *num* , the livestock population has increased from *num* .
*num* million to *num* .
*num* million .
similarly , the human population has increased from *num* , *num* in *num* to *num* .
*num* million in *num* , a *num* % increase in *num* years .
" over *num* % of all households in botswana own cattle , which is currently the largest single source of rural income .
" " rangeland degradation or desertification is regarded as the reduction in land productivity as a result of overstocking and overgrazing , or as a result of veld product gathering for commercial use .
degradation is exacerbated by the effects of drought and climate change .
" environmentalists report that the okavango delta is drying up due to the increased grazing of livestock .
the okavango delta is one of the major semi-forested wetlands in botswana and one of the largest inland deltas in the world ; it is a crucial ecosystem to the survival of many animals .
the department of forestry and range resources has already begun to implement a project to reintroduce indigenous vegetation into communities in kgalagadi south , kweneng north and boteti .
reintroduction of indigenous vegetation will help with the degradation of the land .
the united states government has also entered into an agreement with botswana , giving them $7 million us dollars to reduce botswana's debt by $8 .
*num* million us dollars .
the stipulation of the us reducing botswana's debt is that botswana will focus on more extensive conservation of the land .
the united nations development programme claims that poverty is a major problem behind the overexploitation of resources , including land , in botswana .
to help change this the undp joined in with a project started in the southern community of struizendam in botswana .
the purpose of the project is to draw from " indigenous knowledge and traditional land management systems " .
the leaders of this movement are supposed to be the people in the community , to draw them in , in turn increasing their possibilities to earn an income and thus decreasing poverty .
the undp also stated that the government has to effectively implement policies to allow people to manage their own local resources and are giving the government information to help with policy development .
botswana is the continent's oldest democracy .
the constitution of botswana is the rule of law , which protects the citizens of botswana and represents their rights .
the politics of botswana take place in a framework of a representative democratic republic , whereby the president of botswana is both head of state and head of government , and of a multi-party system .
executive power is exercised by the government .
legislative power is vested in both the government and the parliament of botswana .
the most recent election , its eleventh , was held on *num* october *num* .
since independence was declared , the party system has been dominated by the botswana democratic party .
the judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature .
botswana ranks *ord* out of *num* states in the *num* democracy index .
according to transparency international , botswana is the least corrupt country in africa and ranks close to portugal and south korea .
it consists of a typical court system of local magistrates courts , a high court and a court of appeal .
the high court is a superior court of record with unlimited original jurisdiction to hear and determine any criminal , civil or constitutional cases under any law .
appeals can be heard by the court of appeal .
the head of the high court is the chief justice .
the court of appeal is the highest and final court in the country and deals with appeals from the high court and the industrial court .
the head of the court of appeal is the judge president .
judges are appointed by the president of botswana on the recommendation of the judicial services commission .
chief justices : with regard to the legal profession , although the law society of botswana has been in existence since *num* , there is still no clear indication in their registry of attorneys as to how certain demographics , such as women , have fared in the legal field .
at the time of independence , botswana had no armed forces .
it was only after the rhodesian and south african militaries struck respectively against the zimbabwe people's revolutionary army and umkhonto we sizwe bases that the botswana defence force ( bdf ) was formed in *num* .
the president is commander-in-chief of the armed forces and appoints a defence council and the bdf currently consists of roughly *num* , *num* servicemen .
following political changes in south africa and the region , the bdf's missions have increasingly focused on prevention of poaching , preparing for disasters , and foreign peacekeeping .
the united states has been the largest single foreign contributor to the development of the bdf , and a large segment of its officer corps have received u .
s .
training .
the botswana government gave the united states permission to explore the possibility of establishing an africa command ( africom ) base in the country .
many of the indigenous san people have been forcibly relocated from their land onto reservations .
to make them relocate , they were denied from accessing water from their land and faced arrest if they hunted , which was their primary source of food .
their lands lie in the middle of the world's richest diamond field .
officially , the government denies that there is any link to mining and claims the relocation is to preserve the wildlife and ecosystem , even though the san people have lived sustainably on the land for millennia .
on the reservations , they struggle to find employment and alcoholism is rampant .
on *num* august *num* the un special rapporteur on minorities , fernand de varennes issued a statement calling on botswana , “to step up efforts to recognize and protect the rights of minorities in relation to public services , land and resource use and the use of minority languages in education and other critical areas .
” homosexual acts are illegal in botswana , as in many african countries .
capital punishment in botswana includes the death penalty by hanging .
the botswana centre for human rights , ditshwanelo , was established in *num* .
botswana's ten districts are : botswana's councils created from urban or town councils are : gaborone city , francistown , lobatse town , selebi-phikwe town , jwaneng town , orapa town and sowa township .
since independence , botswana has had one of the fastest growth rates in per capita income in the world .
botswana has transformed itself from one of the poorest countries in the world to an upper middle-income country .
although botswana was resource-abundant , a good institutional framework allowed the country to reinvest resource-income in order to generate stable future income .
by one estimate , it has the fourth highest gross national income at purchasing power parity in africa , giving it a standard of living around that of mexico .
the ministry of trade and industry of botswana is responsible for promoting business development throughout the country .
according to the international monetary fund , economic growth averaged over *num* % per year from *num* to *num* .
botswana has a high level of economic freedom compared to other african countries .
the government has maintained a sound fiscal policy , despite consecutive budget deficits in *num* and *num* , and a negligible level of foreign debt .
it earned the highest sovereign credit rating in africa and has stockpiled foreign exchange reserves ( over $7 billion in *num* / *num* ) amounting to almost two and a half years of current imports .
an array of financial institutions populates the country's financial system , with pension funds and commercial banks being the two most important segments by asset size .
banks remain profitable , well-capitalised , and liquid , as a result of growing national resources and high interest rates .
the bank of botswana serves as a central bank .
the country's currency is the botswana pula .
botswana's competitive banking system is one of africa's most advanced .
generally adhering to global standards in the transparency of financial policies and banking supervision , the financial sector provides ample access to credit for entrepreneurs .
the capital bank opened in *num* .
, there are a dozen licensed banks in the country .
the government is involved in banking through state-owned financial institutions and a special financial incentives program that is aimed at increasing botswana's status as a financial centre .
credit is allocated on market terms , although the government provides subsidised loans .
reform of non-bank financial institutions has continued in recent years , notably through the establishment of a single financial regulatory agency that provides more effective supervision .
the government has abolished exchange controls , and with the resulting creation of new portfolio investment options , the botswana stock exchange is growing .
the constitution provides for an independent judiciary , and the government respects this in practice .

botswana cultural musical instruments are not confined only to the strings or drums .
the hands are used as musical instruments too , by either clapping them together or against phathisi ( goat skin turned inside out wrapped around the calf area , only used by men ) to create music and rhythm .
for the last few decades , the guitar has been celebrated as a versatile music instrument for tswana music as it offers a variety in string which the segaba instrument does not have .

bipedalism bipedalism is a form of terrestrial locomotion where an organism moves by means of its two rear limbs or legs .
an animal or machine that usually moves in a bipedal manner is known as a biped , meaning " two feet " ( from the latin " bis " for " double " and " pes " for " foot " ) .
types of bipedal movement include walking , running , or hopping .
few modern species are habitual bipeds whose normal method of locomotion is two-legged .
within mammals , habitual bipedalism has evolved multiple times , with the macropods , kangaroo rats and mice , springhare , hopping mice , pangolins and hominin apes ( australopithecines and humans ) as well as various other extinct groups evolving the trait independently .
in the triassic period some groups of archosaurs ( a group that includes crocodiles and dinosaurs ) developed bipedalism ; among them the dinosaurs , all the early forms and many later groups were habitual or exclusive bipeds ; the birds are members of a clade of exclusively bipedal dinosaurs , the theropods a larger number of modern species intermittently or briefly use a bipedal gait .
several lizard species move bipedally when running , usually to escape from threats .
many primate and bear species will adopt a bipedal gait in order to reach food or explore their environment .
several arboreal primate species , such as gibbons and indriids , exclusively walk on two legs during the brief periods they spend on the ground .
many animals rear up on their hind legs whilst fighting or copulating .
some animals commonly stand on their hind legs , in order to reach food , to keep watch , to threaten a competitor or predator , or to pose in courtship , but do not move bipedally .
the word is derived from the latin words " bi ( s ) " ' two ' and " ped- " ' foot ' , as contrasted with quadruped ' four feet ' .
limited and exclusive bipedalism can offer a species several advantages .
bipedalism raises the head ; this allows a greater field of vision with improved detection of distant dangers or resources , access to deeper water for wading animals and allows the animals to reach higher food sources with their mouths .
while upright , non-locomotory limbs become free for other uses , including manipulation ( in primates and rodents ) , flight ( in birds ) , digging ( in giant pangolin ) , combat ( in bears , great apes and the large monitor lizard ) or camouflage ( in certain species of octopus ) .
the maximum bipedal speed appears less fast than the maximum speed of quadrupedal movement with a flexible backbone – both the ostrich and the red kangaroo can reach speeds of , while the cheetah can exceed .
even though bipedalism is slower at first , over long distances , it has allowed humans to outrun most other animals according to the endurance running hypothesis .
bipedality in kangaroo rats has been hypothesized to improve locomotor performance , which could aid in escaping from predators .
zoologists often label behaviors , including bipedalism , as " facultative " ( i .
e .
optional ) or " obligate " ( the animal has no reasonable alternative ) .
even this distinction is not completely clear-cut — for example , humans other than infants normally walk and run in biped fashion , but almost all can crawl on hands and knees when necessary .
there are even reports of humans who normally walk on all fours with their feet but not their knees on the ground , but these cases are a result of conditions such as uner tan syndrome — very rare genetic neurological disorders rather than normal behavior .
even if one ignores exceptions caused by some kind of injury or illness , there are many unclear cases , including the fact that " normal " humans can crawl on hands and knees .
this article therefore avoids the terms " facultative " and " obligate " , and focuses on the range of styles of locomotion " normally " used by various groups of animals .
normal humans may be considered " obligate " bipeds because the alternatives are very uncomfortable and usually only resorted to when walking is impossible .
there are a number of states of movement commonly associated with bipedalism .
the great majority of living terrestrial vertebrates are quadrupeds , with bipedalism exhibited by only a handful of living groups .
humans , gibbons and large birds walk by raising one foot at a time .
on the other hand , most macropods , smaller birds , lemurs and bipedal rodents move by hopping on both legs simultaneously .
tree kangaroos are able to walk or hop , most commonly alternating feet when moving arboreally and hopping on both feet simultaneously when on the ground .
there are no known living or fossil bipedal amphibians .
many species of lizards become bipedal during high-speed , sprint locomotion , including the world's fastest lizard , the spiny-tailed iguana ( genus " ctenosaura " ) .
the first known biped is the bolosaurid " eudibamus " whose fossils date from *num* million years ago .
its long hindlegs , short forelegs , and distinctive joints all suggest bipedalism .
the species became extinct in the early permian .
all birds are bipeds when on the ground , a feature inherited from their dinosaur ancestors .
bipedalism evolved more than once in archosaurs , the group that includes both dinosaurs and crocodilians .
all dinosaurs are thought to be descended from a fully bipedal ancestor , perhaps similar to " eoraptor " .
bipedal movement also re-evolved in a number of other dinosaur lineages such as the iguanodons .
some extinct members of the crocodilian line , a sister group to the dinosaurs and birds , also evolved bipedal forms - a crocodile relative from the triassic , " effigia okeeffeae " , is thought to be bipedal .
pterosaurs were previously thought to have been bipedal , but recent trackways have all shown quadrupedal locomotion .
bipedalism also evolved independently among the dinosaurs .
dinosaurs diverged from their archosaur ancestors approximately *num* million years ago during the middle to late triassic period , roughly *num* million years after the permian-triassic extinction event wiped out an estimated *num* % of all life on earth .
radiometric dating of fossils from the early dinosaur genus " eoraptor " establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time .
paleontologists suspect " eoraptor " resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs ; if this is true , its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small , bipedal predators .
the discovery of primitive , dinosaur-like ornithodirans such as " marasuchus " and " lagerpeton " in argentinian middle triassic strata supports this view ; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small , bipedal predators .
a number of groups of extant mammals have independently evolved bipedalism as their main form of locomotion - for example humans , giant pangolins , the extinct giant ground sloths , numerous species of jumping rodents and macropods .
humans , as their bipedalism has been extensively studied , are documented in the next section .
macropods are believed to have evolved bipedal hopping only once in their evolution , at some time no later than *num* million years ago .
bipedal movement is less common among mammals , most of which are quadrupedal .
all primates possess some bipedal ability , though most species primarily use quadrupedal locomotion on land .
primates aside , the macropods ( kangaroos , wallabies and their relatives ) , kangaroo rats and mice , hopping mice and springhare move bipedally by hopping .
very few mammals other than primates commonly move bipedally by an alternating gait rather than hopping .
exceptions are the ground pangolin and in some circumstances the tree kangaroo .
one black bear , pedals , became famous locally and on the internet for having a frequent bipedal gait , although this is attributed to injuries on the bear's front paws .
most bipedal animals move with their backs close to horizontal , using a long tail to balance the weight of their bodies .
the primate version of bipedalism is unusual because the back is close to upright ( completely upright in humans ) .
many primates can stand upright on their hind legs without any support .
common chimpanzees , bonobos , gibbons and baboons exhibit forms of bipedalism .
on the ground sifakas move like all indrids with bipedal sideways hopping movements of the hind legs , holding their forelimbs up for balance .
geladas , although usually quadrupedal , will sometimes move between adjacent feeding patches with a squatting , shuffling bipedal form of locomotion .
humans are the only primates who are normally biped , due to an extra curve in the spine which stabilizes the upright position , as well as shorter arms relative to the legs than is the case for the nonhuman great apes .
the evolution of human bipedalism began in primates about four million years ago , or as early as seven million years ago with " sahelanthropus " .
one hypothesis for human bipedalism is that it evolved as a result of differentially successful survival from carrying food to share with group members , although there are alternative hypotheses .
injured individuals injured chimpanzees and bonobos have been capable of sustained bipedalism .
three captive primates , one macaque natasha and two chimps , oliver and poko ( chimpanzee ) , were found to move bipedally .
natasha switched to exclusive bipedalism after an illness , while poko was discovered in captivity in a tall , narrow cage .
oliver reverted to knuckle-walking after developing arthritis .
non-human primates often use bipedal locomotion when carrying food .
other mammals engage in limited , non-locomotory , bipedalism .
a number of other animals , such as rats , raccoons , and beavers will squat on their hindlegs to manipulate some objects but revert to four limbs when moving ( the beaver will move bipedally if transporting wood for their dams , as will the raccoon when holding food ) .
bears will fight in a bipedal stance to use their forelegs as weapons .
a number of mammals will adopt a bipedal stance in specific situations such as for feeding or fighting .
ground squirrels and meerkats will stand on hind legs to survey their surroundings , but will not walk bipedally .
dogs ( e .
g .
faith ) can stand or move on two legs if trained , or if birth defect or injury precludes quadrupedalism .
the gerenuk antelope stands on its hind legs while eating from trees , as did the extinct giant ground sloth and chalicotheres .
the spotted skunk will walk on its front legs when threatened , rearing up on its front legs while facing the attacker so that its anal glands , capable of spraying an offensive oil , face its attacker .
bipedalism is unknown among the amphibians .
among the non-archosaur reptiles bipedalism is rare , but it is found in the ' reared-up ' running of lizards such as agamids and monitor lizards .
many reptile species will also temporarily adopt bipedalism while fighting .
one genus of basilisk lizard can run bipedally across the surface of water for some distance .
among arthropods , cockroaches are known to move bipedally at high speeds .
bipedalism is rarely found outside terrestrial animals , though at least two types of octopus walk bipedally on the sea floor using two of their arms , allowing the remaining arms to be used to camouflage the octopus as a mat of algae or a floating coconut .
there are at least twelve distinct hypotheses as to how and why bipedalism evolved in humans , and also some debate as to when .
bipedalism evolved well before the large human brain or the development of stone tools .
bipedal specializations are found in " australopithecus " fossils from *num* .
2-3 .
*num* million years ago , although " sahelanthropus " may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago .
nonetheless , the evolution of bipedalism was accompanied by significant evolutions in the spine including the forward movement in position of the foramen magnum , where the spinal cord leaves the cranium .
recent evidence regarding modern human sexual dimorphism ( physical differences between male and female ) in the lumbar spine has been seen in pre-modern primates such as " australopithecus africanus " .
this dimorphism has been seen as an evolutionary adaptation of females to bear lumbar load better during pregnancy , an adaptation that non-bipedal primates would not need to make .
adapting bipedalism would have required less shoulder stability , which allowed the shoulder and other limbs to become more independent of each other and adapt for specific suspensory behaviors .
in addition to the change in shoulder stability , changing locomotion would have increased the demand for shoulder mobility , which would have propelled the evolution of bipedalism forward .
the different hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive and a number of selective forces may have acted together to lead to human bipedalism .
it is important to distinguish between adaptations for bipedalism and adaptations for running , which came later still .
numerous causes for the evolution of human bipedalism involve freeing the hands for carrying and using tools , sexual dimorphism in provisoning , changes in climate and environment ( from jungle to savanna ) that favored a more elevated eye-position , and to reduce the amount of skin exposed to the tropical sun .
it is possible that bipedalism provided a variety of benefits to the hominin species , and scientists have suggested multiple reasons for evolution of human bipedalism .
there is also not only the question of why the earliest hominins were partially bipedal but also why hominins became more bipedal over time .
for example , the postural feeding hypothesis describes how the earliest hominins became bipedal for the benefit of reaching food in trees while the savanna-based theory describes how the late hominins that started to settle on the ground became increasingly bipedal .
napier ( *num* ) argued that it was very unlikely that a single factor drove the evolution of bipedalism .
he stated " "it seems unlikely that any single factor was responsible for such a dramatic change in behaviour .
in addition to the advantages of accruing from ability to carry objects - food or otherwise - the improvement of the visual range and the freeing of the hands for purposes of defence and offence must equally have played their part as catalysts .
” " sigmon argued that chimpanzees demonstrate bipedalism in different contexts , and one single factor should be used to explain bipedalism : preadaptation for human bipedalism .
day ( *num* ) emphasized three major pressures that drove evolution of bipedalism *num* .
food acquisition *num* .
predator avoidance *num* .
reproductive success .
ko ( *num* ) states there are two questions regarding bipedalism *num* .
why were the earliest hominins partially bipedal *num* .
why did hominins become more bipedal over time .
he argues that these questions can be answered with combination of prominent theories such as savanna-based , postural feeding , and provisioning .
according to the savanna-based theory , hominines descended from the trees and adapted to life on the savanna by walking erect on two feet .
the theory suggests that early hominids were forced to adapt to bipedal locomotion on the open savanna after they left the trees .
this theory is closely related to the knuckle-walking hypothesis , which states that human ancestors used quadrupedal locomotion on the savanna , as evidenced by morphological characteristics found in " australopithecus anamensis " and " australopithecus afarensis " forelimbs , and that it is less parsimonious to assume that knuckle walking developed twice in genera pan and gorilla instead of evolving it once as synapomorphy for pan and gorilla before losing it in australopithecus .
the evolution of an orthograde posture would have been very helpful on a savanna as it would allow the ability to look over tall grasses in order to watch out for predators , or terrestrially hunt and sneak up on prey .
it was also suggested in p .
e .
wheeler's " the evolution of bipedality and loss of functional body hair in hominids " , that a possible advantage of bipedalism in the savanna was reducing the amount of surface area of the body exposed to the sun , helping regulate body temperature .
in fact , elizabeth vrba’s turnover pulse hypothesis supports the savanna-based theory by explaining the shrinking of forested areas due to global warming and cooling , which forced animals out into the open grasslands and caused the need for hominids to acquire bipedality .
rather , the bipedal adaptation hominines had already achieved was used in the savanna .
the fossil evidence reveals that early bipedal hominins were still adapted to climbing trees at the time they were also walking upright .
it is possible that bipedalism evolved in the trees , and was later applied to the savanna as a vestigial trait .
humans and orangutans are both unique to a bipedal reactive adaptation when climbing on thin branches , in which they have increased hip and knee extension in relation to the diameter of the branch , which can increase an arboreal feeding range and can be attributed to a convergent evolution of bipedalism evolving in arboreal environments .
hominine fossils found in dry grassland environments led anthropologists to believe hominines lived , slept , walked upright , and died only in those environments because no hominine fossils were found in forested areas .
however , fossilization is a rare occurrence—the conditions must be just right in order for an organism that dies to become fossilized for somebody to find later , which is also a rare occurrence .
the fact that no hominine fossils were found in forests does not ultimately lead to the conclusion that no hominines ever died there .
the convenience of the savanna-based theory caused this point to be overlooked for over a hundred years .
some of the fossils found actually showed that there was still an adaptation to arboreal life .
for example , lucy , the famous " australopithecus afarensis " , found in hadar in ethiopia , which may have been forested at the time of lucy’s death , had curved fingers that would still give her the ability to grasp tree branches , but she walked bipedally .
“little foot , ” a nearly-complete specimen of " australopithecus africanus " , has a divergent big toe as well as the ankle strength to walk upright .
“little foot” could grasp things using his feet like an ape , perhaps tree branches , and he was bipedal .
ancient pollen found in the soil in the locations in which these fossils were found suggest that the area used to be much more wet and covered in thick vegetation and has only recently become the arid desert it is now .
an alternative explanation is the mixture of savanna and scattered forests increased terrestrial travel by proto-humans between clusters of trees , and bipedalism offered greater efficiency for long-distance travel between these clusters than quadrupedalism .
in an experiment monitoring chimpanzee metabolic rate via oxygen consumption , it was found that the quadrupedal and bipedal energy costs were very similar , implying that this transition in early ape-like ancestors would have not have been very difficult or energetically costing .
this increased travel efficiency is likely to have been selected for as it assisted the wide dispersal of early hominids across the savanna to create start populations .
the postural feeding hypothesis has been recently supported by dr .
kevin hunt , a professor at indiana university .
this hypothesis asserts that chimpanzees were only bipedal when they eat .
while on the ground , they would reach up for fruit hanging from small trees and while in trees , bipedalism was used to reach up to grab for an overhead branch .
these bipedal movements may have evolved into regular habits because they were so convenient in obtaining food .
also , hunt's hypotheses states that these movements coevolved with chimpanzee arm-hanging , as this movement was very effective and efficient in harvesting food .
when analyzing fossil anatomy , " australopithecus afarensis " has very similar features of the hand and shoulder to the chimpanzee , which indicates hanging arms .
also , the " australopithecus " hip and hind limb very clearly indicate bipedalism , but these fossils also indicate very inefficient locomotive movement when compared to humans .
for this reason , hunt argues that bipedalism evolved more as a terrestrial feeding posture than as a walking posture .
( https : / / www .
researchgate .
net / publication / 288349918_the_postural_feeding_hypothesis_an_ecological_model_for_the_evolution_of_bipedalism ) a similar study conducted by thorpe et al .
looked at how the most arboreal great ape , the orangutan , held onto supporting branches in order to navigate branches that were too flexible or unstable otherwise .
they found that in more than *num* % of locomotive instances the orangutans used their hands to stabilize themselves while they navigated thinner branches .
they hypothesized that increased fragmentation of forests where a .
afarensis as well as other ancestors of modern humans and other apes resided could have contributed to this increase of bipedalism in order to navigate the diminishing forests .
their findings also shed light on a couple of discrepancies observed in the anatomy of a .
afarensis , such as the ankle joint , which allowed it to “wobble” and long , highly flexible forelimbs .
the idea that bipedalism started from walking in trees explains both the increased flexibility in the ankle as well as the long limbs which would be used to grab hold of branches .
one theory on the origin of bipedalism is the behavioral model presented by c .
owen lovejoy , known as " male provisioning " .
lovejoy theorizes that the evolution of bipedalism was linked to monogamy .
in the face of long inter-birth intervals and low reproductive rates typical of the apes , early hominids engaged in pair-bonding that enabled greater parental effort directed towards rearing offspring .
lovejoy proposes that male provisioning of food would improve the offspring survivorship and increase the pair's reproductive rate .
thus the male would leave his mate and offspring to search for food and return carrying the food in his arms walking on his legs .
this model is supported by the reduction ( " feminization " ) of the male canine teeth in early hominids such as " sahelanthropus tchadensis " and " ardipithecus ramidus " , which along with low body size dimorphism in " ardipithecus " and " australopithecus " , suggests a reduction in inter-male antagonistic behavior in early hominids .
in addition , this model is supported by a number of modern human traits associated with concealed ovulation ( permanently enlarged breasts , lack of sexual swelling ) and low sperm competition ( moderate sized testes , low sperm mid-piece volume ) that argues against recent adaptation to a polygynous reproductive system .
however , this model has generated some controversy , as others have argued that early bipedal hominids were instead polygynous .
among most monogamous primates , males and females are about the same size .
that is sexual dimorphism is minimal , and other studies have suggested that australopithecus afarensis males were nearly twice the weight of females .
however , lovejoy's model posits that the larger range a provisioning male would have to cover ( to avoid competing with the female for resources she could attain herself ) would select for increased male body size to limit predation risk .
furthermore , as the species became more bipedal , specialized feet would prevent the infant from conveniently clinging to the mother - hampering the mother's freedom and thus make her and her offspring more dependent on resources collected by others .
modern monogamous primates such as gibbons tend to be also territorial , but fossil evidence indicates that " australopithecus afarensis " lived in large groups .
however , while both gibbons and hominids have reduced canine sexual dimorphism , female gibbons enlarge ( ' masculinize ' ) their canines so they can actively share in the defense of their home territory .
instead , the reduction of the male hominid canine is consistent with reduced inter-male aggression in a group living primate .
recent studies of *num* .
*num* million years old " ardipithecus ramidus " suggest bipedalism , it is thus possible that bipedalism evolved very early in homininae and was reduced in chimpanzee and gorilla when they became more specialized .
according to richard dawkins in his book " the ancestor's tale " , chimps and bonobos are descended from " australopithecus " gracile type species while gorillas are descended from paranthropus .
these apes may have once been bipedal , but then lost this ability when they were forced back into an arboreal habitat , presumably by those australopithecines from whom eventually evolved hominins .
early homininaes such as " ardipithecus ramidus " may have possessed an arboreal type of bipedalism that later independently evolved towards knuckle-walking in chimpanzees and gorillas and towards efficient walking and running in modern humans ( see figure ) .
it is also proposed that one cause of neanderthal extinction was a less efficient running .
joseph jordania from the university of melbourne recently ( *num* ) suggested that bipedalism was one of the central elements of the general defense strategy of early hominids , based on aposematism , or warning display and intimidation of potential predators and competitors with exaggerated visual and audio signals .
according to this model , hominids were trying to stay as visible and as loud as possible all the time .
several morphological and behavioral developments were employed to achieve this goal : upright bipedal posture , longer legs , long tightly coiled hair on the top of the head , body painting , threatening synchronous body movements , loud voice and extremely loud rhythmic singing / stomping / drumming on external subjects .
slow locomotion and strong body odor ( both characteristic for hominids and humans ) are other features often employed by aposematic species to advertise their non-profitability for potential predators .
there are a variety of ideas which promote a specific change in behaviour as the key driver for the evolution of hominid bipedalism .
for example , wescott ( *num* ) and later jablonski & chaplin ( *num* ) suggest that bipedal threat displays could have been the transitional behaviour which led to some groups of apes beginning to adopt bipedal postures more often .
others ( " e .
g .
" dart *num* ) have offered the idea that the need for more vigilance against predators could have provided the initial motivation .
dawkins ( " e .
g .
" *num* ) has argued that it could have begun as a kind of fashion that just caught on and then escalated through sexual selection .
and it has even been suggested ( " e .
g .
" tanner *num* : *num* ) that male phallic display could have been the initial incentive , as well as increased sexual signaling in upright female posture .
the thermoregulatory model explaining the origin of bipedalism is one of the simplest theories so far advanced , but it is a viable explanation .
dr .
peter wheeler , a professor of evolutionary biology , proposes that bipedalism raises the amount of body surface area higher above the ground which results in a reduction in heat gain and helps heat dissipation .
when a hominid is higher above the ground , the organism accesses more favorable wind speeds and temperatures .
during heat seasons , greater wind flow results in a higher heat loss , which makes the organism more comfortable .
also , wheeler explains that a vertical posture minimizes the direct exposure to the sun whereas quadrupedalism exposes more of the body to direct exposure .
analysis and interpretations of ardipithecus reveal that this hypothesis needs modification to consider that the forest and woodland environmental preadaptation of early-stage hominid bipedalism preceded further refinement of bipedalism by the pressure of natural selection .
this then allowed for the more efficient exploitation of the hotter conditions ecological niche , rather than the hotter conditions being hypothetically bipedalism's initial stimulus .
a feedback mechanism from the advantages of bipedality in hot and open habitats would then in turn make a forest preadaptation solidify as a permanent state .
charles darwin wrote that " man could not have attained his present dominant position in the world without the use of his hands , which are so admirably adapted to the act of obedience of his will " .
darwin ( *num* : *num* ) and many models on bipedal origins are based on this line of thought .
gordon hewes ( *num* ) suggested that the carrying of meat " over considerable distances " ( hewes *num* : *num* ) was the key factor .
isaac ( *num* ) and sinclair et al .
( *num* ) offered modifications of this idea , as indeed did lovejoy ( *num* ) with his " provisioning model " described above .
others , such as nancy tanner ( *num* ) , have suggested that infant carrying was key , while others again have suggested stone tools and weapons drove the change .
this stone-tools theory is very unlikely , as though ancient humans were known to hunt , the discovery of tools was not discovered for thousands of years after the origin of bipedalism , chronologically precluding it from being a driving force of evolution .
( wooden tools and spears fossilize poorly and therefore it is difficult to make a judgment about their potential usage .
) the observation that large primates , including especially the great apes , that predominantly move quadrupedally on dry land , tend to switch to bipedal locomotion in waist deep water , has led to the idea that the origin of human bipedalism may have been influenced by waterside environments .
this idea , labelled " the wading hypothesis " , was originally suggested by the oxford marine biologist alister hardy who said : " it seems to me likely that man learnt to stand erect first in water and then , as his balance improved , he found he became better equipped for standing up on the shore when he came out , and indeed also for running .
" it was then promoted by elaine morgan , as part of the aquatic ape hypothesis , who cited bipedalism among a cluster of other human traits unique among primates , including voluntary control of breathing , hairlessness and subcutaneous fat .
the " aquatic ape hypothesis " , as originally formulated , has not been accepted or considered a serious theory within the anthropological scholarly community .
others , however , have sought to promote wading as a factor in the origin of human bipedalism without referring to further ( " aquatic ape " related ) factors .
since *num* carsten niemitz has published a series of papers and a book on a variant of the wading hypothesis , which he calls the " amphibian generalist theory " ( ) .
other theories have been proposed that suggest wading and the exploitation of aquatic food sources ( providing essential nutrients for human brain evolution or critical fallback foods ) may have exerted evolutionary pressures on human ancestors promoting adaptations which later assisted full-time bipedalism .
it has also been thought that consistent water-based food sources had developed early hominid dependency and facilitated dispersal along seas and rivers .
during the hominin’s early evolution , brains became larger , due to increased intelligence , and bipedalism became the norm .
the consequences of these two changes in particular resulted in painful and difficult labor due to the increased favor of a narrow pelvis for bipedalism being countered by larger heads passing through the constricted birth canal .
this phenomenon is commonly known as the obstetrical dilemma .
bipedal movement occurs in a number of ways , and requires many mechanical and neurological adaptations .
some of these are described below .
energy-efficient means of standing bipedally involve constant adjustment of balance , and of course these must avoid overcorrection .
the difficulties associated with simple standing in upright humans are highlighted by the greatly increased risk of falling present in the elderly , even with minimal reductions in control system effectiveness .
shoulder stability would decrease with the evolution of bipedalism .
shoulder mobility would increase because the need for a stable shoulder is only present in arboreal habitats .
shoulder mobility would support suspensory locomotion behaviors which are present in human bipedalism .
the forelimbs are freed from weight-bearing requirements , which makes the shoulder a place of evidence for the evolution of bipedalism .
walking is characterized by an " inverted pendulum " movement in which the center of gravity vaults over a stiff leg with each step .
force plates can be used to quantify the whole-body kinetic & potential energy , with walking displaying an out-of-phase relationship indicating exchange between the two .
this model applies to all walking organisms regardless of the number of legs , and thus bipedal locomotion does not differ in terms of whole-body kinetics .
in humans , walking is composed of several separate processes : running is characterized by a spring-mass movement .
kinetic and potential energy are in phase , and the energy is stored & released from a spring-like limb during foot contact .
again , the whole-body kinetics are similar to animals with more limbs .
bipedalism requires strong leg muscles , particularly in the thighs .
contrast in domesticated poultry the well muscled legs , against the small and bony wings .
likewise in humans , the quadriceps and hamstring muscles of the thigh are both so crucial to bipedal activities that each alone is much larger than the well-developed biceps of the arms .
a biped has the ability to breathe while running , without strong coupling to stride cycle .
humans usually take a breath every other stride when their aerobic system is functioning .
during a sprint the anaerobic system kicks in and breathing slows until the anaerobic system can no longer sustain a sprint .
for nearly the whole of the *ord* century , bipedal robots were very difficult to construct and robot locomotion involved only wheels , treads , or multiple legs .
recent cheap and compact computing power has made two-legged robots more feasible .
some notable biped robots are asimo , hubo , mabel and qrio .
recently , spurred by the success of creating a fully passive , un-powered bipedal walking robot , those working on such machines have begun using principles gleaned from the study of human and animal locomotion , which often relies on passive mechanisms to minimize power consumption .

the estonian monetary system is managed by the estonian central bank , the national budget is drafted by the government of the republic and approved by the parliament .
the draft must be presented to the parliament at least three months before the beginning of the budget year .
the rules for drafting and passage of the state budget is described in the state budget act .
financial supervision is provided by the financial supervision authority .
it supervises securities market , banks , insurance providers , insurance mediators , investment associations and management companies .
drafting of the national budget is annually co-ordinated by the ministry of finance and supported by other ministries .
the ministries prepare plans for at least the next three years and then negotiate the draft budget with the ministry of finance , while the government of the republic acts as a mediator .
after the draft has been finalized by the government of the republic , it is then presented to the parliament for approval .
the implementation of the budget is then organized by the ministry of finance .
rearrangement of the budget , so that the total revenues and expenses don't change , is passed as amendments , but changes to the total revenues and expenses have to be made through an additional budget .
revenues and expenses are accounted by the state treasury .
estonia has one of the lowest national debts in europe .
part of the reason is because the state budget act requires the structural budget position to be in balance .
there has also traditionally been a general political consensus over keeping the budget in balance and holding a decent reserve .
estonian economy is frequently rated as one of the freest in the world and maintains a stable international credit rating .
high efficiency is provided through an advanced internet banking system and e-governance .
foreign relations are managed mainly by the parliament , the government of the republic ( including various ministries ) and the president of the republic , who mostly serves a representative role .
the government can enter into international agreements and present them to the parliament for ratification .
agreements that are in conflict with the constitution can not be ratified .
one notable example of such a case was when estonia decided to join the european union , which required the amendment of the constitution in order to ratify the accession treaty .
the mandate for the amendment of the constitution was gained through a public referendum .
estonia's main foreign policy goals are to maintain national security and stability of international relations , ensuring the functioning of estonian economy , protecting citizens abroad , maintaining good influence and reputation , and promoting democracy , human rights , rule of law and economic freedom .
to achieve these goals , estonia has set its priorities on involvement and integration into the european union and nato , and forming strong relations with countries that share its values , especially its close baltic and nordic neighbours .
baltic and nordic cooperation is coordinated through such formats as : baltic council of ministers , baltic assembly , nordic-baltic eight ( nb8 ) , council of the baltic sea states and nordic council of ministers .
estonia is also a member of the un , oecd , osce and wto , among others .
treaties can be initiated or concluded by the ministry of foreign affairs .
other ministries and the state chancellery can make proposals on treaties to the ministry of foreign affairs , which then reviews the proposals .
if the submission meets requirements , the ministry can then send it to the government of the republic for approval .
ratification of treaties is performed by the parliament .
the performance of treaties is guaranteed by the government of the republic .
the procedures pertaining to foreign relations are described in the foreign relations act .
after decades of soviet occupation , estonia decided to re-establish its independence in *num* .
because the annexation of estonia was never recognized , and on the basis of the historical continuity of statehood , the state inherited the full responsibility for the rights and obligations of the republic of estonia that existed before the occupation .
this means , that multilateral treaties , which were approved before the occupation , were considered to be still in effect .
thus , estonia has re-assumed its international obligations through the restoration of old treaties .
estonias national defence is based on initial self-defence capability and membership in nato .
estonia's security policy utilizes a broad concept of security , similar to the concept of total defence in several nordic countries , in which all sectors of society are involved .
according to the constitution , all citizens of estonia have a duty to participate in national defence .
male citizens between the ages of 17-27 must partake in 8-12 month military service , though female citizens are also free to serve .
peace-time and war-time organisation of national defence is determined by the national defence act .
the supreme commander of national defence is the president of the republic .
the president is advised by the national defence council , which consists of the president of the parliament , chairman of the national defence committee , chairman of the foreign affairs committee , the prime minister with other ministers and the commander of the defence forces .
planning , development and organisation of national defence is coordinated by the security committee of the government of the republic .
management of defence readiness , state of emergency and state of war are directed by the prime minister .
increase of defence readiness needs to be approved by the parliament .
beginning and end of state of war and mobilisation is proposed by the president and declared by the parliament .
in case of aggression against the republic of estonia , state of war can be declared by the president without a corresponding resolution from the parliament .
use of the defence forces in international cooperation is decided by the parliament .
the activities of the defence forces are directed and organised by the commander of the estonian defence forces .
amoxicillin amoxicillin is an antibiotic often used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections .
these include middle ear infection , strep throat , pneumonia , skin infections , and urinary tract infections among others .
it is taken by mouth , or less commonly by injection .
common adverse effects include nausea and rash .
it may also increase the risk of yeast infections and , when used in combination with clavulanic acid , diarrhea .
it should not be used in those who are allergic to penicillin .
while usable in those with kidney problems , the dose may need to be decreased .
its use in pregnancy and breastfeeding does not appear to be harmful .
amoxicillin is in the beta-lactam family of antibiotics .
amoxicillin was discovered in *num* and came into medical use in *num* .
it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines , which lists the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system .
it is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in children .
amoxicillin is available as a generic medication .
it has a wholesale cost in the developing world of between us$0 .
*num* and *num* .
*num* per pill .
in the united states , ten days of treatment costs about us$16 ( $0 .
*num* per pill ) .
in *num* , it was the *ord* most prescribed medication in the united states , with more than *num* million prescriptions .
amoxicillin is used in the treatment of a number of infections , including acute otitis media , streptococcal pharyngitis , pneumonia , skin infections , urinary tract infections , " salmonella " infections , lyme disease , and chlamydia infections .
children with acute otitis media who are younger than *num* months of age are generally treated with amoxicillin or other antibiotic .
although most children with acute otitis media who are older than two years old do not benefit from treatment with amoxicillin or other antibiotic , such treatment may be helpful in children younger than two years old with acute otitis media that is bilateral or accompanied by ear drainage .
in the past , amoxicillin was dosed three times daily when used to treat acute otitis media , which resulted in missed doses in routine ambulatory practice .
there is now evidence that two times daily dosing or once daily dosing has similar effectiveness .
amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate have been recommended by guidelines as the drug of choice for bacterial sinusitis and other respiratory infections .
most sinusitis infections are caused by viruses , for which amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate are ineffective , and the small benefit gained by amoxicillin may be overridden by the adverse effects .
amoxicillin is recommended as the preferred first-line treatment for community-acquired pneumonia in adults by the national institute for health and care excellence , either alone ( mild to moderate severity disease ) or in combination with a macrolide .
the world health organization recommends amoxicillin as first-line treatment for pneumonia that is not " severe " .
amoxicillin is used in post-exposure inhalation of anthrax to prevent disease progression and for prophylaxis .
it is effective as one part of a multi-drug regimen for treatment of stomach infections of " helicobacter pylori " .
it is typically combined with a proton-pump inhibitor ( such as omeprazole ) and a macrolide antibiotic ( such as clarithromycin ) ; other drug combinations are also effective .
amoxicillin is effective for treatment of early cutaneous lyme borreliosis ; the effectiveness and safety of oral amoxicillin is neither better nor worse than common alternatively-used antibiotics .
amoxicillin is occasionally used for the treatment of skin infections , such as acne vulgaris .
it is often an effective treatment for cases of acne vulgaris that have responded poorly to other antibiotics , such as doxycycline and minocycline .
amoxicillin is recommended by the world health organization for the treatment of infants with signs and symptoms of pneumonia in resource-limited situations when the parents are unable or unwilling to accept hospitalization of the child .
amoxicillin in combination with gentamicin is recommended for the treatment of infants with signs of other severe infections when hospitalization is not an option .
it is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done , to prevent " streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens , such as people with sickle-cell disease , and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax .
the united kingdom recommends against its use for infectious endocarditis prophylaxis .
these recommendations do not appear to have changed the rates of infection for infectious endocarditis .
amoxicillin is susceptible to degradation by β-lactamase-producing bacteria , which are resistant to most β-lactam antibiotics , such as penicillin .
for this reason , it may be combined with clavulanic acid , a β-lactamase inhibitor .
this drug combination is commonly called co-amoxiclav .
it is a moderate-spectrum , bacteriolytic , β-lactam antibiotic in the aminopenicillin family used to treat susceptible gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria .
it is usually the drug of choice within the class because it is better-absorbed , following oral administration , than other β-lactam antibiotics .
in general , " streptococcus , bacillus subtilis , enterococcus , haemophilus , helicobacter , " and " moraxella " are susceptible to amoxicillin , whereas " citrobacter , klebsiella " and " pseudomonas aeruginosa " are resistant to it .
some " e .
coli " and most clinical strains of " staphylococcus aureus " have developed resistance to amoxicillin to varying degrees .
adverse effects are similar to those for other β-lactam antibiotics , including nausea , vomiting , rashes , and antibiotic-associated colitis .
loose bowel movements ( diarrhea ) may also occur .
rarer adverse effects include mental changes , lightheadedness , insomnia , confusion , anxiety , sensitivity to lights and sounds , and unclear thinking .
immediate medical care is required upon the first signs of these adverse effects .
the onset of an allergic reaction to amoxicillin can be very sudden and intense ; emergency medical attention must be sought as quickly as possible .
the initial phase of such a reaction often starts with a change in mental state , skin rash with intense itching ( often beginning in fingertips and around groin area and rapidly spreading ) , and sensations of fever , nausea , and vomiting .
any other symptoms that seem even remotely suspicious must be taken very seriously .
however , more mild allergy symptoms , such as a rash , can occur at any time during treatment , even up to a week after treatment has ceased .
for some people allergic to amoxicillin , the adverse effects can be fatal due to anaphylaxis .
use of the amoxicillin / clavulanic acid combination for more than one week has caused mild hepatitis in some patients .
young children having ingested acute overdoses of amoxicillin manifested lethargy , vomiting , and renal dysfunction .
there is poor reporting of adverse effects of amoxicillin from clinical trials .
for this reason , the severity and frequency of adverse effects from amoxicillin is probably higher than reported from clinical trials .
between *num* and *num* % of children taking amoxicillin ( or ampicillin ) show a late-developing ( hours after beginning medication and having never taken penicillin-like medication previously ) rash , which is sometimes referred to as the " amoxicillin rash " .
the rash can also occur in adults .
the rash is described as maculopapular or morbilliform ( measles-like ; therefore , in medical literature , it is called " amoxicillin-induced morbilliform rash " .
) .
it starts on the trunk and can spread from there .
this rash is unlikely to be a true allergic reaction and is not a contraindication for future amoxicillin usage , nor should the current regimen necessarily be stopped .
however , this common amoxicillin rash and a dangerous allergic reaction cannot easily be distinguished by inexperienced persons , so a healthcare professional is often required to distinguish between the two .
a nonallergic amoxicillin rash may also be an indicator of infectious mononucleosis .
some studies indicate about 80-90 % of patients with acute epstein barr virus infection treated with amoxicillin or ampicillin develop such a rash .
amoxicillin may interact with these drugs : amoxicillin ( α-amino-p-hydroxybenzyl penicillin ) is a semisynthetic derivative of penicillin with a structure similar to ampicillin but with better absorption when taken by mouth , thus yielding higher concentrations in blood and in urine .
amoxicillin diffuses easily into tissues and body fluids .
penetration into the central nervous system increases in meningitis .
it will cross the placenta and is excreted into breastmilk in small quantities .
it is excreted into the urine and metabolized by the liver .
it has an onset of *num* minutes and a half-life of *num* .
*num* hours in newborns and *num* .
*num* hours in adults .
amoxicillin attaches to the cell wall of susceptible bacteria and results in their death .
it also is a bactericidal compound .
it is effective against streptococci , pneumococci , enterococci , " haemophilus influenzae " , " escherichia coli " , " proteus mirabilis " , " neisseria meningitidis " , " neisseria gonorrhoeae " , " shigella " , " chlamydia trachomatis " , " salmonella " , " borrelia burgdorferi " , and " helicobacter pylori " .
as a derivative of ampicillin , amoxicillin is a member of the penicillin family and , like penicillins , is a β-lactam antibiotic .
it inhibits cross-linkage between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains that make up a major component of the bacterial cell wall .
it has two ionizable groups in the physiological range ( the amino group in alpha-position to the amide carbonyl group and the carboxyl group ) .
amoxicillin was one of several semisynthetic derivatives of 6-aminopenicillanic acid ( 6-apa ) developed at beecham , england in the 1960s .
it became available in *num* and was the second aminopenicillin to reach the market ( after ampicillin in *num* ) .
co-amoxiclav became available in *num* .
pharmaceutical manufacturers make amoxicillin in trihydrate form , for oral use available as capsules , regular , chewable and dispersible tablets , syrup and pediatric suspension for oral use , and as the sodium salt for intravenous administration .
amoxicillin is most commonly taken orally .
the liquid forms are helpful where the patient might find it difficult to take tablets or capsules .
an extended-release is available .
the intravenous form of amoxicillin is not sold in the us .
when an intravenous aminopenicillin is required in the us , ampicillin is typically used .
when there is an adequate response to ampicillin , the course of antibiotic therapy may often be completed with oral amoxicillin .
research with mice indicated successful delivery using intraperitoneally injected amoxicillin-bearing microparticles .
"amoxicillin " is the inn , ban , and usan , while " amoxycillin " is the aan .
amoxicillin is one of the semisynthetic penicillins discovered by beecham scientists .
the patent for amoxicillin has expired , thus amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav preparations are marketed under various trade names across the world .
afonso de albuquerque afonso de albuquerque , duke of goa ( ; *num* – *num* december *num* ) ( also spelled aphonso or alfonso ) , was a portuguese general , a " great conqueror " , a statesman , and an empire builder .
afonso advanced the three-fold portuguese grand scheme of combating islam , spreading christianity , and securing the trade of spices by establishing a portuguese asian empire .
among his achievements , afonso managed to conquer the island of goa and was the first european of the renaissance to raid the persian gulf , and he led the first voyage by a european fleet into the red sea .
his military and administrative works are generally regarded as among the most vital to building and securing the portuguese empire in the orient , the middle east , and the spice routes of eastern oceania .
afonso is generally considered a military genius , and " probably the greatest naval commander of the age " given his successful strategy—he attempted to close all the indian ocean naval passages to the atlantic , red sea , persian gulf , and to the pacific , transforming it into a portuguese " mare clausum " established over the opposition of the ottoman empire and its muslim and hindu allies .
in the expansion of the portuguese empire , afonso initiated a rivalry that would become known as the ottoman–portuguese war , which would endure for many years .
many of the ottoman–portuguese conflicts in which he was directly involved took place in the indian ocean , in the persian gulf regions for control of the trade routes , and on the coasts of india .
it was his military brilliance in these initial campaigns against the much larger ottoman empire and its allies that enabled portugal to become the first global empire in history .
he had a record of engaging and defeating much larger armies and fleets .
for example , his capture of ormuz in *num* against the persians was accomplished with a fleet of seven ships .
other famous battles and offensives which he led include the conquest of goa in *num* and the capture of malacca in *num* .
he became admiral of the indian ocean , and was appointed head of the " fleet of the arabian and persian sea " in *num* .
during the last five years of his life , he turned to administration , where his actions as the second governor of portuguese india were crucial to the longevity of the portuguese empire .
he pioneered european sea trade with china during the ming dynasty with envoy rafael perestrello , thailand with duarte fernandes as envoy , and with timor , passing through malaysia and indonesia in a voyage headed by antónio de abreu and francisco serrão .
he also aided diplomatic relations with ethiopia using priest envoys joão gomes and joão sanches , and established diplomatic ties with persia , during the safavid dynasty .
he became known as " the great " , " the terrible " , " the caesar of the east " , " the lion of the seas " , and " the portuguese mars " .
afonso de albuquerque was born in *num* in alhandra , near lisbon .
he was the second son of gonçalo de albuquerque , lord of vila verde dos francos , and dona leonor de menezes .
his father held an important position at court and was connected by remote illegitimate descent with the portuguese monarchy .
he was educated in mathematics and latin at the court of afonso v of portugal , where he befriended prince john , the future king john ii of portugal .
afonso's early training is described by diogo barbosa machado : "“d .
alfonso de albuquerque , surnamed the great , by reason of the heroic deeds wherewith he filled europe with admiration , and asia with fear and trembling , was born in the year *num* , in the estate called , for the loveliness of its situation , the paradise of the town of alhandra , six leagues distant from lisbon .
he was the second son of gonçalo de albuquerque , lord of villaverde , and of d .
leonor de menezes , daughter of d .
álvaro gonçalves de athayde , count of atouguia , and of his wife d .
guiomar de castro , and corrected this injustice of nature by climbing to the summit of every virtue , both political and moral .
he was educated in the palace of the king d .
afonso v , in whose palaestra he strove emulously to become the rival of that african mars” .
afonso served *num* years in north africa , where he gained military experience in fierce campaigns against muslim powers and ottoman turks .
in *num* , under the command of afonso v of portugal , he was present at the conquest of tangier and arzila in morocco , serving there as an officer for some years .
in *num* he accompanied prince john in wars against castile , including the battle of toro .
he participated in the campaign on the italian peninsula in *num* to rescue ferdinand ii of aragon from the ottoman invasion of otranto that ended in victory .
on his return in *num* , when prince john was crowned as king john ii , afonso was made master of the horse for his distinguished exploits , chief equerry ( " estribeiro-mor " ) to the king , a post which he held throughout john's reign ( 1481–95 ) .
in *num* he returned to military campaigns in north africa , as commander of defense in the graciosa fortress , an island in the river luco near the city of larache , and in *num* was part of the guard of king john ii , returning to arzila in *num* , where his younger brother martim died fighting by his side .
afonso made his mark under the stern john ii , and won military campaigns in africa and the mediterranean sea , yet asia is where he would make his greatest impact .
when king manuel i of portugal was enthroned , he showed some reticence towards afonso , a close friend of his dreaded predecessor and seventeen years his senior .
eight years later , on *num* april *num* , after a long military career and at a mature age , afonso was sent on his first expedition to india together with his cousin francisco de albuquerque .
each commanded three ships , sailing with duarte pacheco pereira and nicolau coelho .
they engaged in several battles against the forces of the zamorin of calicut ( " calecute " , kozhikode ) and succeeded in establishing the king of cohin ( " cohim " , kochi ) securely on his throne .
in return , the king gave them permission to build the portuguese fort " immanuel " ( fort kochi ) and establish trade relations with quilon ( " coulão " , kollam ) .
this laid the foundation for the eastern portuguese empire .
afonso returned home in july *num* , and was well received by king manuel i .
after he assisted with the creation of a strategy for the portuguese efforts in the east , king manuel entrusted him with the command of a squadron of five vessels in the fleet of sixteen sailing for india in early *num* headed by tristão da cunha .
their aim was to conquer socotra and build a fortress there , hoping to close the trade in the red sea .
afonso went as " chief-captain for the coast of arabia " , sailing under da cunha's orders until reaching mozambique .
he carried a sealed letter with a secret mission ordered by the king : after fulfilling the first mission , he was to replace the first viceroy of india , francisco de almeida , whose term ended two years later .
before departing , he legitimized a natural son born in *num* , and made his will .
the fleet left lisbon on *num* april *num* .
afonso piloted his ship himself , having lost his appointed pilot on departure .
in mozambique channel , they rescued captain joão da nova , who had encountered difficulties on his return from india ; da nova and his ship , the " frol de la mar " , joined da cunha's fleet .
from malindi , da cunha sent envoys to ethiopia , which at the time was thought to be closer than it actually is .
those included the priest joão gomes , joão sanches and tunisian sid mohammed who , having failed to cross the region , headed for socotra ; from there , afonso managed to land them in filuk .
after successful attacks on arab cities on the east africa coast , they conquered socotra and built a fortress at suq , hoping to establish a base to stop the red sea commerce to the indian ocean .
however , socotra was abandoned four years later , as it was not advantageous as a base .
at socotra , they parted ways : tristão da cunha sailed for india , where he would relieve the portuguese besieged at cannanore , while afonso took seven ships and *num* men to ormuz in the persian gulf , one of the chief eastern centers of commerce .
on his way , he conquered the cities of curiati ( kuryat ) , muscat in july *num* , and khor fakkan , accepting the submission of the cities of kalhat and sohar .
he arrived at ormuz on *num* september and soon captured the city , which agreed to become a tributary state of the portuguese king .
hormuz was then a tributary state of shah ismail of persia .
in a famous episode , shortly after its conquest albuquerque was confronted by persian envoys , who demanded the payment of the due tribute from him instead .
he ordered them to be given a stock of cannonballs , arrows and weapons , retorting that " such was the currency struck in portugal to pay the tribute demanded from the dominions of king manuel" according to brás de albuquerque , it was shah ismael who coined the term " lion of the seas " , addressing albuquerque as such .
afonso began building the fort of our lady of victory ( later renamed fort of our lady of the conception ) , engaging his men of all ranks in the work .
however , some of his officers revolted against the heavy work and climate and , claiming that afonso was exceeding his orders , departed for india .
with the fleet reduced to two ships and left without supplies , he was unable to maintain this position for long .
forced to abandon ormuz in january *num* , he raided coastal villages to resupply the settlement of socotra , returned to ormuz , and then headed to india .
afonso arrived at cannanore on the malabar coast in december *num* , where he opened before the viceroy , dom francisco de almeida , the sealed letter which he had received from the king , and which named as governor to succeed almeida .
the viceroy , supported by the officers who had abandoned afonso at ormuz , had a matching royal order , but declined to yield , protesting that his term ended only in january and stating his intention to avenge his son's death by fighting the mamluk fleet of mirocem , refusing afonso's offer to fight him himself .
afonso avoided confrontation , which could have led to civil war , and moved to kochi , india , to await further instruction from the king , maintaining his entourage himself .
he was described by fernão lopes de castanheda as patiently enduring open opposition from the group that had gathered around almeida , with whom he kept formal contact .
increasingly isolated , he wrote to diogo lopes de sequeira , who arrived in india with a new fleet , but was ignored as sequeira joined the viceroy .
at the same time , afonso refused approaches from opponents of the viceroy , who encouraged him to seize power .
on *num* february *num* , almeida fought the naval battle of diu against a joint fleet of mamluks , ottomans , the zamorin of calicut , and the sultan of gujarat , regarding it as personal revenge for the death of his son .
his victory was decisive : the ottomans and mamluks abandoned the indian ocean , easing the way for portuguese rule there for the next century .
in august , after a petition from afonso's former officers with the support of diogo lopes de sequeira claiming him unfit for governance , afonso was sent in custody to st .
angelo fort in cannanore .
there he remained under what he considered to be imprisonment .
in september *num* , sequeira tried to establish contact with the sultan of malacca but failed , leaving behind *num* portuguese prisoners .
afonso was released after three months ' confinement , on the arrival at cannanore of the marshal of portugal with a large fleet .
the portuguese marshal was the most important portuguese noble ever to visit india and he brought an armada of fifteen ships and *num* , *num* men sent by the king to defend afonso's rights , and to take calicut .
on *num* november *num* , afonso became the second governor of the state of india , a position he would hold until his death .
almeida having returned home in *num* , afonso speedily showed the energy and determination of his character .
he intended to dominate the muslim world and control the spice trade .
initially king manuel i and his council in lisbon tried to distribute the power , outlining three areas of jurisdiction in the indian ocean .
in *num* , the nobleman diogo lopes de sequeira was sent with a fleet to southeast asia , to seek an agreement with sultan mahmud shah of malacca , but failed and returned to portugal .
to jorge de aguiar was given the region between the cape of good hope and gujarat .
he was succeeded by duarte de lemos , but left for cochin and then for portugal , leaving his fleet to afonso .
in january *num* , obeying the orders from the king and aware of the absence of zamorin , afonso advanced on calicut .
the attack was unsuccessful , as marshal fernando coutinho ventured into the inner city against instructions , fascinated by its richness , and was ambushed .
during the rescue , afonso was shot in the chest and had to retreat , barely escaping with his life .
coutinho was killed during the escape .
soon after the failed attack , afonso assembled a fleet of *num* ships and *num* men .
contemporary reports state that he wanted to fight the egyptian mamluk sultanate fleet in the red sea or return to hormuz .
however , he had been informed by timoji ( a privateer in the service of the hindu vijayanagara empire ) that it would be easier to fight them in goa , where they had sheltered after the battle of diu , and also of the illness of the sultan yusuf adil shah , and war between the deccan sultanates .
so he relied on surprise in the capture of goa from the sultanate of bijapur .
he thus completed another mission , for portugal wanted not to be seen as an eternal " guest " of kochi and had been coveting goa as the best trading port in the region .
a first assault took place in goa from *num* march to *num* may *num* .
after initial occupation , feeling unable to hold the city given the poor condition of its fortifications , the cooling of hindu residents ' support and insubordination among his ranks following an attack by ismail adil shah , afonso refused a truce offered by the sultan and abandoned the city in august .
his fleet was scattered , and a palace revolt in kochi hindered his recovery , so he headed to fort anjediva .
new ships arrived from portugal , which were intended for the nobleman diogo mendes de vasconcelos at malacca , who had been given a rival command of the region .
three months later , on *num* november afonso reappeared at goa with a renovated fleet .
diogo mendes de vasconcelos was compelled to accompany him with the reinforcements for malacca and about *num* malabari reinforcements from cannanore .
in less than a day , they took goa from ismail adil shah and his ottoman allies , who surrendered on *num* december .
it is estimated that *num* of the *num* muslim defenders of the city died , either in the fierce battle in the streets or by drowning while trying to escape .
afonso regained the support of the hindu population , although he frustrated the initial expectations of timoji , who aspired to become governor .
afonso rewarded him by appointing him chief " aguazil " of the city , an administrator and representative of the hindu and muslim people , as a knowledgeable interpreter of the local customs .
he then made an agreement to lower the yearly tribute .
in goa , afonso established the first portuguese mint in the east , after timoja's merchants had complained of the scarcity of currency , taking it as an opportunity to solidify the territorial conquest .
the new coin , based on the existing local coins , showed a cross on the obverse and an armillary sphere ( or " esfera " ) , king manuel's badge , on the reverse .
gold cruzados or " manueis " , silver " esferas " and " alf-esferas " , and bronze " leais " were issued .
another mint was established at malacca in *num* .
albuquerque founded at goa the " hospital real de goa " or royal hospital of goa , by the church of santa catarina .
upon hearing that the doctors were extorting the sickly with excessive fees , albuquerque summoned them , declaring that " you charge a physicians ' pay and don't know what disease the men who serve our lord the king suffer from .
thus , i want to teach you what is it that they die from " and put them to work building the city walls all day till nightfall before releasing them .
despite constant attacks , goa became the center of portuguese india , with the conquest triggering the compliance of neighbouring kingdoms : the sultan of gujarat and the zamorin of calicut sent embassies , offering alliances and local grants to fortify .
afonso then used goa to secure the spice trade in favor of portugal and sell persian horses to vijayanagara and hindu princes in return for their assistance .
afonso explained to his armies why the portuguese wanted to capture malacca : in february *num* , through a friendly hindu merchant , nina chatu , afonso received a letter from rui de araújo , one of the nineteen portuguese held at malacca since *num* .
it urged moving forward with the largest possible fleet to demand their release , and gave details of the fortifications .
afonso showed it to diogo mendes de vasconcelos , as an argument to advance in a joint fleet .
in april *num* , after fortifying goa , he gathered a force of about *num* portuguese , *num* hindu mercenaries and about eighteen ships .
he then sailed to malacca against orders and despite the protest of diogo mendes , who claimed command of the expedition .
afonso eventually centralized the portuguese government in the indian ocean .
after the malaccan conquest he wrote a letter to the king to explain his disagreement with diogo mendes , suggesting that further divisions could be harmful to the portuguese in india .
under his command was ferdinand magellan , who had participated in the failed embassy of diogo lopes de sequeira in *num* .
after a false start towards the red sea , they sailed to the strait of malacca .
it was the richest city that the portuguese tried to take , and a focal point in the trade network where malay traders met gujarati , chinese , japanese , javanese , bengali , persian and arabic , among others , described by tomé pires as of invaluable richness .
despite its wealth , it was mostly a wooden-built city , with few masonry buildings but was defended by a mercenary force estimated at *num* , *num* men and more than *num* pieces of artillery .
its greatest weakness was the unpopularity of the government of sultan mahmud shah , who favoured muslims , arousing dissatisfaction amongst other merchants .
afonso made a bold approach to the city , his ships decorated with banners , firing cannon volleys .
he declared himself lord of all the navigation , demanded the sultan release the prisoners and pay for damages , and demanded consent to build a fortified trading post .
the sultan eventually freed the prisoners , but was unimpressed by the small portuguese contingent .
afonso then burned some ships at the port and four coastal buildings as a demonstration .
the city being divided by the malacca river , the connecting bridge was a strategic point , so at dawn on *num* july the portuguese landed and fought a tough battle , facing poisoned arrows , taking the bridge in the evening .
after fruitlessly waiting for the sultan's reaction , they returned to the ships and prepared a junk ( offered by chinese merchants ) , filling it with men , artillery and sandbags .
commanded by antónio de abreu , it sailed upriver at high tide to the bridge .
the day after , all had landed .
after a fierce fight during which the sultan appeared with an army of war elephants , the defenders were dispersed and the sultan fled .
afonso waited for the reaction of the sultan .
merchants approached , asking for portuguese protection .
they were given banners to mark their premises , a sign that they would not be looted .
on *num* august , the portuguese attacked again , but the sultan had fled the city .
under strict orders , they looted the city , but respected the banners .
afonso prepared malacca's defenses against a malay counterattack , building a fortress , assigning his men to shifts and using stones from the mosque and the cemetery .
despite the delays caused by heat and malaria , it was completed in november *num* , its surviving door now known as " a famosa " ( ' the famous ' ) .
it was possibly then that afonso had a large stone engraved with the names of the participants in the conquest .
to quell disagreements over the order of the names , he had it set facing the wall , with the single inscription " lapidem quem reprobaverunt aedificantes " ( latin for " the stone the builders rejected " , from david's prophecy , psalm *num* : 22–23 ) on the front .
he settled the portuguese administration , reappointing rui de araújo as factor , a post assigned before his *num* arrest , and appointing rich merchant nina chatu to replace the previous " bendahara " , representative of the " kafir " people and adviser .
besides assisting in the governance of the city and first portuguese coinage , he provided the junks for several diplomatic missions .
meanwhile , afonso arrested and had executed the powerful javanese merchant utimuti raja who , after being appointed to a position in the portuguese administration as representative of the javanese population , had maintained contacts with the exiled royal family .
afonso arranged for the shipping of many órfãs d'el-rei to portuguese malacca .
on *num* november *num* afonso sailed from malacca to the coast of malabar on the old " flor de la mar " carrack that had served to support the conquest of malacca .
despite its unsound condition , he used it to transport the treasure amassed in the conquest , given its large capacity .
he wanted to give the court of king manuel a show of malaccan treasures .
there were also the offers from the kingdom of siam ( thailand ) to the king of portugal and all his own fortune .
on the voyage the " flor de la mar " was wrecked in a storm , and afonso barely escaped drowning .
most muslim and gujarati merchants having fled the city , afonso invested in diplomatic efforts demonstrating generosity to southeast asian merchants , like the chinese , to encourage good relations with the portuguese .
trade and diplomatic missions were sent to continental kingdoms : rui nunes da cunha was sent to pegu ( burma ) , from where king binyaram sent back a friendly emissary to kochi in *num* and sumatra , sumatran kings of kampar and indragiri sending emissaries to afonso accepting the new power , as vassal states of malacca .
knowing of siamese ambitions over malacca , afonso sent duarte fernandes in a diplomatic mission to the kingdom of siam ( thailand ) , returning in a chinese junk .
he was one of the portuguese who had been arrested in malacca , having gathered knowledge about the culture of the region .
there he was the first european to arrive , establishing amicable relations between the kingdom of portugal and the court of the king of siam ramathibodi ii , returning with a siamese envoy bearing gifts and letters to afonso and the king of portugal .
in november , after having secured malacca and learning the location of the then secret " spice islands " , afonso sent three ships to find them , led by trusted antónio de abreu with deputy commander francisco serrão .
malay sailors were recruited to guide them through java , the lesser sunda islands and the ambon island to banda islands , where they arrived in early *num* .
there they remained for a month , buying and filling their ships with nutmeg and cloves .
antónio de abreu then sailed to amboina whilst serrão sailed towards the moluccas , but he was shipwrecked near seram .
sultan abu lais of ternate heard of their stranding , and , seeing a chance to ally himself with a powerful foreign nation , brought them to ternate in *num* where they were permitted to build a fort on the island , the " " , built in *num* .
in early *num* , jorge álvares , sailing on a mission under afonso's orders , was allowed to land in lintin island , on the pearl river delta in southern china .
soon after , afonso sent rafael perestrello to southern china , seeking trade relations with the ming dynasty .
in ships from portuguese malacca , rafael sailed to canton ( guangzhou ) in *num* , and again from *num* to *num* to trade with chinese merchants .
these ventures , along with those of tomé pires and fernão pires de andrade , were the first direct european diplomatic and commercial ties with china .
however , after the death of the chinese zhengde emperor on *num* april *num* , conservative factions at court seeking to limit eunuch influence rejected the new portuguese embassy , fought sea battles with the portuguese around tuen mun , and tomé was forced to write letters to malacca stating that he and other ambassadors would not be released from prison in china until the portuguese relinquished their control of malacca and returned it to the deposed sultan of malacca ( who was previously a ming tributary vassal ) .
nonetheless , portuguese relations with china became normalized again by the 1540s and in *num* a permanent portuguese base at macau in southern china was established with consent from the ming court .
afonso returned from malacca to cochin , but could not sail to goa as it faced a serious revolt headed by the forces of ismael adil shah , the sultan of bijapur , commanded by rasul khan and his countrymen .
during afonso's absence from malacca , portuguese who opposed the taking of goa had waived its possession , even writing to the king that it would be best to let it go .
held up by the monsoon and with few forces available , afonso had to wait for the arrival of reinforcement fleets headed by his nephew d .
garcia de noronha , and jorge de mello pereira .
while at cochin , albuquerque started a school .
in a private letter to king manuel i , he states that he had found a chest full of books with which to teach the children of married portuguese settlers ( " casados " ) and christian converts to read and write which , according to albuquerque , there were about a hundred in his time , " all very sharp and easily learn what they are taught " .
on *num* september *num* , afonso sailed from cochin to goa with fourteen ships carrying *num* , *num* soldiers .
determined to recapture the fortress , he ordered trenches dug and a wall breached .
but on the day of the planned final assault , rasul khan surrendered .
afonso demanded the fort be handed over with its artillery , ammunition and horses , and the deserters to be given up .
some had joined rasul khan when the portuguese were forced to flee goa in may *num* , others during the recent siege .
rasul khan consented , on condition that their lives be spared .
afonso agreed and he left goa .
he did spare the lives of the deserters , but had them horribly mutilated .
one such renegade was fernão lopes , bound for portugal in custody , who escaped at the island of saint helena and led a ' robinson crusoe ' life for many years .
after such measures the town became the most prosperous portuguese settlement in india .
in december *num* an envoy from ethiopia arrived at goa .
mateus was sent by the regent queen eleni , following the arrival of the portuguese from socotra in *num* , as an ambassador for the king of portugal in search of a coalition to help face growing muslim influence .
he was received in goa with great honour by afonso , as a long-sought " prester john " envoy .
his arrival was announced by king manuel to pope leo x in *num* .
although mateus faced the distrust of afonso's rivals , who tried to prove he was some impostor or muslim spy , afonso sent him to portugal .
the king is described as having wept with joy at their report .
in february *num* , while mateus was in portugal , afonso sailed to the red sea with a force of about *num* portuguese and *num* malabaris .
he was under orders to secure that channel for portugal .
socotra had proved ineffective to control the red sea entrance and was abandoned , and afonso's hint that massawa could be a good portuguese base might have been influenced by mateus ' reports .
knowing that the mamluks were preparing a second fleet at suez , he wanted to advance before reinforcements arrived in aden , and accordingly laid siege to the city .
aden was a fortified city , but although he had scaling ladders they broke during the chaotic attack .
after half a day of fierce battle afonso was forced to retreat .
he cruised the red sea inside the bab al-mandab , with the first european fleet to have sailed this route .
he attempted to reach jeddah , but the winds were unfavourable and so he sheltered at kamaran island in may , until sickness among the men and lack of fresh water forced him to retreat .
in august *num* , after a second attempt to reach aden , he returned to india with no substantial results .
in order to destroy the power of egypt , he wrote to king manuel of the idea of diverting the course of the nile river to render the whole country barren .
perhaps most tellingly , he intended to steal the body of the islamic prophet , muhammad , and hold it for ransom until all muslims had left the holy land .
although albuquerque's expedition failed to reach suez , such an incursion into the red sea by a christian fleet for the first time in history stunned the muslim world , and panic spread in cairo .
albuquerque achieved during his term a favourable end to hostilities between the portuguese and the zamorin of calicut , which had lasted ever since the massacre of the portuguese in calicut in *num* .
as naval trade faltered and vassals defected , with no foreseeable solutions to the conflict with the portuguese , the court of the zamorin fell to in-fighting .
the ruling zamorin was assassinated and replaced by a rival , under the instigation of albuquerque .
thus , peace talks could commence .
the portuguese were allowed to build a fortress in calicut itself , and acquired rights to obtain as much pepper and ginger as they wished , at stipulated prices , and half the customs of calicut as yearly tribute .
construction of the fortress began immediately , under the guise of chief-architect tomás fernandes .
with peace concluded , in *num* afonso devoted himself to governing goa and receiving embassies from indian governors , strengthening the city and encouraging marriages of portuguese men and local women .
at that time , portuguese women were barred from traveling overseas .
in *num* under a policy which afonso promulgated , the portuguese government encouraged their explorers to marry local women .
to promote settlement , the king of portugal granted freeman status and exemption from crown taxes to portuguese men ( known as " casados " , or " married men " ) who ventured overseas and married local women .
with afonso's encouragement , mixed marriages flourished .
he appointed local people for positions in the portuguese administration and did not interfere with local traditions ( except " sati " , the practice of immolating widows , which he banned ) .
in march *num* king manuel sent to pope leo x a huge and exotic embassy led by tristão da cunha , who toured the streets of rome in an extravagant procession of animals from the colonies and wealth from the indies .
his reputation reached its peak , laying foundations of the portuguese empire in the east .
in early *num* , afonso sent ambassadors to gujarat's sultan muzaffar shah ii , ruler of cambay , to seek permission to build a fort on diu , india .
the mission returned without an agreement , but diplomatic gifts were exchanged , including an indian rhinoceros .
afonso sent the gift , named " ganda " , and its indian keeper , ocem , to king manuel .
in late *num* , manuel sent it as a gift , the famous dürer's rhinoceros to pope leo x .
dürer never saw the actual rhinoceros , which was the first living example seen in europe since roman times .
in *num* , at cannanore , afonso was visited by a persian ambassador from shah ismail i , who had sent ambassadors to gujarat , ormuz and bijapur .
the shah's ambassador to bijapur invited afonso to send back an envoy to persia .
miguel ferreira was sent via ormuz to tabriz , where he had several interviews with the shah about common goals on defeating the mamluk sultan .
at the same time , albuquerque decided to conclude the effective conquest of hormuz .
he had learned that after the portuguese retreat in *num* , a young king was reigning under the influence of a powerful persian vizier , reis hamed , whom the king greatly feared .
at ormuz in march *num* , afonso met the king and asked the vizier to be present .
he then had him immediately stabbed and killed by his entourage , thus " freeing " the dominated king , so the island in the persian gulf yielded to him without resistance and remained a vassal state of the portuguese empire .
ormuz itself would not be persian territory for another century , until a british-persian alliance finally expelled the portuguese in *num* .
at ormuz , afonso met with miguel ferreira , returning with rich presents and an ambassador , carrying a letter from the persian potentate shah ismael , inviting afonso to become a leading lord in persia .
there he remained , engaging in diplomatic efforts , receiving envoys and overseeing the construction of the new fortress , while becoming increasingly ill .
his illness was reported as early as september *num* .
in november *num* , he embarked back to goa , a journey he would not live to complete .
afonso's life ended on a bitter note , with a painful and ignominious close .
at this time , his political enemies at the portuguese court were planning his downfall .
they had lost no opportunity in stirring up the jealousy of king manuel against him , insinuating that afonso intended to usurp power in portuguese india .
while on his return voyage from ormuz in the persian gulf , near the harbor of chaul , he received news of a portuguese fleet arriving from europe , bearing dispatches announcing that he was to be replaced by his personal foe , lopo soares de albergaria .
realizing the plot that his enemies had moved against him , profoundly disillusioned , he voiced his bitterness : " grave must be my sins before the king , for i am in ill favor with the king for love of the men , and with the men for love of the king .
" feeling himself near death , he donned the surcoat of the order of santiago , which he was a knight of , and drew up his will , appointed the captain and senior officials of ormuz , and organized a final council with his captains to decide the main matters affecting the portuguese state of india .
he wrote a brief letter to king manuel , asking him to confer onto his natural son " all of the high honors and rewards " that were justly due to afonso .
he wrote in dignified and affectionate terms , assuring manuel of his loyalty .
on *num* december *num* , afonso de albuquerque died within sight of goa .
as his death was known , in the city " grait wailing arose " , and many took to the streets to witness his body carried on a chair by his main captains , in a procession lit by torches amidst the crowd .
afonso's body was buried in goa , according to his will , in the church of nossa senhora da serra ( our lady of the hill ) , which he had been built in *num* to thank the madonna for his escape from kamaran island .
that night , even the hindu natives of goa gathered to mourn him alongside the portuguese , " for he was much loved by all " , and it was said that " god had need of him for war , and for that he had taken him " .
in portugal , king manuel's zigzagging policies continued , still trapped by the constraints of real-time medieval communication between lisbon and india and unaware that afonso was dead .
hearing rumours that the mamluk sultan of egypt was preparing a magnificent army at suez to prevent the conquest of ormuz , he repented of having replaced afonso , and in march *num* urgently wrote to albergaria to return the command of all operations to afonso and provide him with resources to face the egyptian threat .
he organized a new portuguese navy in asia , with orders that afonso ( if he was still in india ) , be made commander-in-chief against the sultan of cairo's armies .
manuel would afterwards learn that afonso had died many months earlier , and that his reversed decision had been delivered many months too late .
after *num* years , in *num* , his body was moved to nossa senhora da graça church in lisbon , which was ruined and rebuilt after the *num* great lisbon earthquake .
king manuel i of portugal was belatedly convinced of afonso's loyalty , and endeavoured to atone for his lack of confidence in afonso by heaping honours upon his son , brás de albuquerque ( 1500–1580 ) , whom he renamed " afonso " in memory of the father .
afonso de albuquerque was a prolific writer , having sent numerous letters to the king during his governorship , covering topics from minor issues to major strategies .
in *num* his son published a collection of his letters under the title " commentarios do grande affonso d'alboquerque"- a clear reference to caesar's commentaries- which he reviewed and re-published in *num* .
there afonso was described as " a man of middle stature , with a long face , fresh complexion , the nose somewhat large .
he was a prudent man , and a latin scholar , and spoke in elegant phrases ; his conversation and writings showed his excellent education .
he was of ready words , very authoritative in his commands , very circumspect in his dealings with the moors , and greatly feared yet greatly loved by all , a quality rarely found united in one captain .
he was very valiant and favoured by fortune .
" in *num* , afonso's feats were described in " the lusiads " , the portuguese main epic poem by luís vaz de camões ( canto x , strophes 40–49 ) .
the poet praises his achievements , but has the muses frown upon the harsh rule of his men , of whom camões was almost a contemporary fellow .
in *num* , afonso was celebrated by fernando pessoa in " mensagem " , a symbolist epic .
in the first part of this work , called " brasão " ( coat-of-arms ) , he relates portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields in the portuguese coat-of-arms , afonso being one of the wings of the griffin headed by henry the navigator , the other wing being king john ii .
a variety of mango that he used to bring on his journeys to india has been named in his honour .
numerous homages have been paid to afonso ; he is featured in the padrão dos descobrimentos monument ; there is a square carrying his name in the portuguese capital of lisbon , which also features a bronze statue ; two portuguese navy ships have been named in his honour : the sloop nrp " afonso de albuquerque " ( *num* ) and the warship nrp " afonso de albuquerque " , the latter belonging to a sloop class named albuquerque .
the fabled spice islands were on the imagination of europe since ancient times .
in the *ord* century ad , the malay peninsula was known by the greek philosopher ptolemy , who labeled it ' aurea chersonesus " ; and who said that it was believed the fabled area held gold in abundance .
even indian traders referred to the east pacific region as " land of gold " and made regular visits to malaya in search of the precious metal , tin and sweet scented jungle woods .
but neither ptolemy , nor rome , nor alexander was able to see the fabled regions of the east pacific .
afonso de albuquerque became the first european to reach the spice islands .
upon discovering the malay archipelago , he proceeded in *num* to conquer malacca , then commissioned an expedition under the command of antónio de abreu and vice-commander francisco serrão ( the latter being a cousin of magellan ) to further explore the extremities of the region in east indonesia .
as a result of these voyages of exploration , the portuguese became the first europeans to discover and to reach the fabled spice islands in the indies in addition to discovering their sea routes .
afonso found what had evaded columbus ' grasp – the wealth of the orient .
his discoveries did not go unnoticed , and it took little time for magellan to arrive in the same region a few years later and discover the philippines for spain , giving birth to the papal treaty of zaragoza .
afonso's operations sent a voyage pushing further south which made the european discovery of timor in the far south of oceania , and the discovery of papua new guinea in *num* .
this was followed up by another portuguese , jorge de menezes in *num* , who named papua new guinea , the " island of the papua " .
through afonso's diplomatic activities , portugal opened the sea between europe and china .
as early as *num* , jorge de albuquerque , a portuguese commanding officer in malacca , sent his subordinate jorge álvares to sail to china on a ship loaded with pepper from sumatra .
after sailing across the sea , jorge álvares and his crew dropped anchor in tamao , an island located at the mouth of the pearl river .
this was the first portuguese to set foot in the territory known as china , the mythical " middle kingdom " where they erected a stone padrão .
álvares is the first european to reach chinese land by sea , and , the first european to enter hong kong .
in *num* afonso de albuquerque , the viceroy of the estado da india dispatched rafael perestrello to sail to china in order to pioneer european trade relations with the chinese nation .
rafael perestrelo was quoted as saying , " being a very good and honest people , the chinese hope to make friends with the portuguese .
" in spite of initial harmony and excitement between the two empires , difficulties soon arose .
portugal's efforts in establishing lasting ties with china did pay off in the long run ; the portuguese colonized macau , and established the first european permanent settlement on chinese soil , which served as a permanent colonial base in southern china , and the two empires maintained an exchange in culture and trade for nearly *num* years .
the longest empire in history ( 1515–1999 ) , begun by afonso de albuquerque five centuries earlier , ended when portugal ceded the government of macau to china .
afonso de albuquerque pioneered trade relations with thailand , and was as such the first recorded european to contact thailand .
afonso de albuquerque had a bastard son with an unrecorded woman .
he legitimized the boy in february *num* .
before his death , he asked king manuel i to leave to the son all his wealth and that the king oversee the son's education .
when afonso died , manuel i renamed the child " afonso " in his father's memory .
brás afonso de albuquerque , or braz in the old spelling , was born in *num* and died in *num* .
church ( building ) a church building or church house , often simply called a church , is a building used for christian religious activities , particularly for christian worship services .
the term is often used by christians to refer to the physical buildings where they worship , but it is sometimes used ( by analogy ) to refer to buildings of other religions .
in traditional christian architecture , the church is often arranged in the shape of a christian cross .
when viewed from plan view the longest part of a cross is represented by the aisle and the junction of the cross is located at the altar area .
towers or domes are often added with the intention of directing the eye of the viewer towards the heavens and inspiring visitors .
modern church buildings have a variety of architectural styles and layouts ; many buildings that were designed for other purposes have now been converted for church use , and conversely many original church buildings have been put to other uses .
the earliest identified christian church building was a house church founded between *num* and *num* .
from the *ord* through the *ord* centuries , a wave of building of cathedrals and smaller parish churches were erected across western europe .
a cathedral is a church building , usually roman catholic , protestant ( anglican ) , eastern orthodox , or oriental orthodox , housing a cathedra , the formal name for the seat or throne of a presiding bishop .
in greek , the adjective " kyriak-ós / -ē / -ón " ( ) means " belonging , or pertaining , to a " kyrios" " ( " lord " ) , and the usage was adopted by early christians of the eastern mediterranean with regard to anything pertaining to the lord jesus christ : hence " "kyriakós oíkos" " ( ) ( " house of the lord " , church ) , " "kyriakē" " ( ) ( " [ the day ] of the lord " , i .
e .
sunday ) , or " "kyriakē proseukhē" " ( ) ( the " lord's prayer " ) .
in standard greek usage , the older word " ecclesia " ( , " ekklesía " , literally " assembly " , " congregation " , or the place where such a gathering occurs ) was retained to signify both a specific edifice of christian worship ( a " church " ) , and the overall community of the faithful ( the " church " ) .
this usage was also retained in latin and the languages derived from latin ( e .
g .
french " église " , italian " chiesa " , spanish " iglesia " , portuguese " igreja " , etc .
) , as well as in the celtic languages ( welsh " eglwys " , irish " eaglais " , breton " iliz " , etc .
) and in turkish ( " kilise " ) .
in the germanic and some slavic languages , the word " kyriak-ós / -ē / -ón " was adopted instead and derivatives formed thereof .
in old english the sequence of derivation started as " cirice " , then middle english " churche " , and eventually " church " in its current pronunciation .
german " kirche " , scots " kirk " , russian ( " tserkov " ) , etc .
, are all similarly derived .
according to the new testament , the earliest christians did not build church buildings .
instead , they gathered in homes ( acts *num* : *num* , *num* : *num* , *num* corinthians *num* : *num* ) or in jewish worship places like the second temple or synagogues ( acts *num* : *num* , *num* : *num* ) .
the earliest archeologically identified christian church is a house church ( " domus ecclesiae " ) , the dura-europos church , founded between *num* and *num* .
in the second half of the *ord* century ad , the first purpose-built halls for christian worship ( " aula ecclesiae " ) began to be constructed .
although many of these were destroyed early in the next century during the diocletianic persecution , even larger and more elaborate church buildings began to appear during the reign of the emperor constantine the great .
from the *ord* through the *ord* centuries , a wave of building of cathedrals and smaller parish churches occurred across western europe .
in addition to being a place of worship , the cathedral or the parish church was used by the community in other ways .
it could serve as a meeting place for guilds or a hall for banquets .
mystery plays were sometimes performed in cathedrals , and cathedrals might also be used for fairs .
the church could be used as a place to thresh and store grain .
between *num* and *num* the romanesque style became popular across europe .
while the name of the romanesque era refers to the tradition of roman architecture , it was actually a west- and central european trend .
romanesque buildings appear rather bulky and compact .
typical features are circular arches , round or octagonal towers and cushion capitals on the pillars .
in the early romanesque era , coffering on the ceiling was fashionable , while later in the same era , groined vault was more popular .
the rooms became wider and the motivs of sculptures became more epic .
the gothic style emerged around *num* in île-de-france and spread through all of europe .
the gothic buildings were less compact than they had been in the romanesque era and often contained symbolic and allegoric features .
for the first time , pointed arches , rib vaults and buttresses were used , with the result that massive walls were not longer needed to stabilise the building .
due to that advantage , the area of the windows became bigger , which resulted in a brighter and more friendly atmosphere inside the church .
the nave became higher and so did the pillars and the church steeple .
the amibition to test out the limits of the architectural possibilities resulted in the collapse of several towers .
in germany and the netherlands , but also in spain , it became popular to build hall churches , in which every vault has the same height .
cathedrals were built in a very lavish way , as in the romanesque era .
examples for that are the notre-dame de paris and the notre-dame de reims in france , but also the san francesco d’assisi in palermo , the salisbury cathedral and the wool church in lavenham , england .
many gothic churches contain features from the romanesque era .
some of the most well-known gothic churches stayed unfinished for hundreds of years , after the gothic style was not popular anymore .
about half of the cologne cathedral was for example build in the *ord* century .
in the *ord* and *ord* century , the change in ethics and society due to the renaissance and the reformation also influenced the building of churches .
the common style was much like the gothic style , but in a simplified way .
the basilica was not the most popular type of church anymore , but instead hall churches were built .
typical features are columns and classical capitals .
in protestant churches , where the proclamation of god's word is of special importance , the visitor's line of view is directed towards the pulpit .
the baroque style was first used in italy around *num* .
from there it spread to the rest of europe and to the european colonies .
during the baroque era , the building industry increased heavily .
buildings , even churches , were used as indicators for wealth , authority and influence .
the use of forms known from the renaissance were extremely exaggerated .
domes and capitals were decorated with moulding and the former stucco-sculptures were replaced by fresco paintings on the ceilings .
for the first time , churches were seen as one connected work of art and consistent artistic concepts were developed .
instead of long buildings , more central-plan buildings were created .
the sprawling decoration with floral ornamentation and mythological motives raised until about *num* to the rococo era .
the protestant parishes preferred lateral churches , in which all the visitors could be as close as possible to the pulpit and the altar .
a common architecture for churches is the shape of a cross ( a long central rectangle , with side rectangles , and a rectangle in front for the altar space or sanctuary ) .
these churches also often have a dome or other large vaulted space in the interior to represent or draw attention to the heavens .
other common shapes for churches include a circle , to represent eternity , or an octagon or similar star shape , to represent the church's bringing light to the world .
another common feature is the spire , a tall tower on the " west " end of the church or over the crossing .
another common feature of many christian churches is the eastwards orientation of the front altar .
often , the altar will not be oriented due east , but in the direction of sunrise .
this tradition originated in byzantium in the *ord* century , and becomes prevalent in the west in the *ord* to *ord* century .
the old roman custom of having the altar at the west end and the entrance at the east was sometimes followed as late as the *ord* century even in areas of northern europe under frankish rule , as seen in petershausen ( constance ) , bamberg cathedral , augsburg cathedral , regensburg cathedral , and hildesheim cathedral .
the latin word basilica ( derived from greek , " basiliké stoà " , royal " stoa " ) was originally used to describe a roman public building ( as in greece , mainly a tribunal ) , usually located in the forum of a roman town .
after the roman empire became officially christian , the term came by extension to refer to a large and important church that has been given special ceremonial rights by the pope .
thus the word retains two senses today , one architectural and the other ecclesiastical .
a cathedral is a church , usually catholic , anglican , oriental orthodox or eastern orthodox , housing the seat of a bishop .
the word cathedral takes its name from " cathedra " , or bishop's throne ( in ) .
the term is sometimes ( improperly ) used to refer to any church of great size .
a church that has the function of cathedral is not necessarily a large building .
it might be as small as christ church cathedral in oxford , england , sacred heart cathedral in raleigh , united states , or chur cathedral in switzerland .
however , frequently , the cathedral along with some of the abbey churches , was the largest building in any region .
a pilgrimage church is a church to which pilgrimages are regularly made , or a church along a pilgrimage route , often located at the tomb of a saints , or holding icons or relics to which miraculous properties are ascribed , the site of marian apparitions , etc .
a conventual church ( or monastery church , minster , " katholikon " ) is the main church building in a christian monastery or abbey .
a collegiate church is a church where the daily office of worship is maintained by a college of canons , which may be presided over by a dean or provost .
collegiate churches were often supported by extensive lands held by the church , or by tithe income from appropriated benefices .
they commonly provide distinct spaces for congregational worship and for the choir offices of their clerical community .
old and disused church buildings can be seen as an interesting proposition for developers as the architecture and location often provide for attractive homes or city centre entertainment venues on the other hand , many newer churches have decided to host meetings in public buildings such as schools , universities , cinemas or theatres .
there is another trend to convert old buildings for worship rather than face the construction costs and planning difficulties of a new build .
unusual venues in the uk include an old tram power station , a former bus garage , an old cinema and bingo hall , a former territorial army drill hall , and a former synagogue .
a windmill has also been converted into a church at reigate heath .
there has been an increase in partnerships between church management and private real estate companies to redevelop church properties into mixed uses .
while it has garnered criticism from some , the partnership offers congregations the opportunity to increase revenue while preserving the property .
colossae colossae ( ; greek : κολοσσαί ) was an ancient city of phrygia in asia minor , and was the location to which the apostle paul directed his epistle to the colossians .
a significant city from the *ord* century bc onwards , it had dwindled in importance by the time of paul , but was notable for the existence of its local angel cult .
it was part of the roman – and then byzantine – province of phrygia pacatiana , before being destroyed in *num* / *num* and its population relocating to nearby chonae ( modern day honaz ) .
the medieval poet manuel philes , incorrectly , imagined that the name " colossae " was connected to the colossus of rhodes .
more recently , in an interpretation which ties colossae to an indo-european root that happens to be shared with the word " kolossos " , jean-pierre vernant has connected the name to the idea of setting up a sacred space or shrine .
another proposal relates the name to the greek " kolazo " , " to punish " .
colossae was located in phrygia , in asia minor .
it was located *num* km southeast of laodicea on the road through the lycus valley between sardeis and celaenae .
at colossae , herodotus describes how , " the river lycos falls into an opening of the earth and disappears from view , and then after an interval of about five furlongs it comes up to view again , and this river also flows into the maiander .
" despite a treacherously ambiguous cartography and history , colossae has been clearly distinguished in modern research from nearby " chonae " ( χῶναι ) , now called honaz , with what remains of the buried ruins of colossae ( " the mound " ) lying *num* km to the north of honaz .
writing in the *ord* century bc , xenophon refers to colossae as " a populous city , wealthy and of considerable magnitude " .
it was famous for its wool trade .
strabo notes that the city drew great revenue from the flocks , and that the wool of colossae gave its name to colour " colossinus " .
in *num* bc , colossae was the site of the execution of the rebellious persian satrap tissaphernes who was lured there and slain by an agent of the party of cyrus the younger .
although during the hellenistic period , the town was of some mercantile importance , by the *ord* century it had dwindled greatly in size and significance .
paul's letter to the colossians point to the existence of an early christian community .
the town was known for its fusion of religious influences ( syncretism ) , which included jewish , gnostic , and pagan influences that in the first century ad were described as an angel-cult .
this unorthodox cult venerated the archangel michael who is said to have caused a curative spring to gush from a fissure in the earth .
colossae was the location of a christian community to which the apostle paul addressed a canonically accepted epistle ( letter ) , which is known for its content's exaltation of the supremacy of christianity's namesake .
one aim of the letter was to address the challenges that the community faced in its context of the syncretistic gnostic religions that were developing in asia minor .
judging from the letter to the colossians , epaphras was a person of some importance in the christian community there ( ; ) , and tradition presents him as its first bishop .
the apostolic constitutions list philemon as a bishop of colossae .
on the other hand , the catholic encyclopedia considers philemon doubtful .
the first historically documented bishop is epiphanius , who was not personally at the council of chalcedon , but whose metropolitan bishop nunechius of laodicea , the capital of the roman province of phrygia pacatiana signed the acts on his behalf .
the city was decimated by an earthquake in the 60s ad , and was rebuilt independent of the support of rome .
the city was later overrun by the saracens in the *ord* and *ord* centuries ad .
colossae's famous church was destroyed in *num* / *num* during the byzantine civil wars .
it was a suffragan diocese of laodicea in phyrigia pacatiane but was replaced in the byzantine period by the chonae settlement on higher ground as of *num* , it had never been excavated , though plans are reported for an australian led expedition to the site .
basketball basketball is a team sport in which two teams , most commonly of five players each , opposing one another on a rectangular court , compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball ( approximately in diameter ) through the defender's hoop ( a basket in diameter mounted high to a backboard at each end of the court ) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop .
a field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three .
after a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws .
the team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated .
players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill .
on offense , players may use a variety of shots—the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard .
it is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling .
the five players on each side at a time fall into five positions player positions : the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile big man is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) .
informally , players may play three-on-three , two-on-two , and one-on-one .
invented in *num* by canadian-american gym teacher james naismith in springfield , massachusetts , united states , basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports .
the national basketball association ( nba ) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity , salaries , talent , and level of competition .
outside north america , the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the euroleague and fiba americas league .
the fiba basketball world cup and men's olympic basketball tournament are the major international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world .
each continent hosts regional competitions for national teams , like eurobasket and fiba americup .
the fiba women's basketball world cup and women's olympic basketball tournament feature top national teams from continental championships .
the main north american league is the wnba ( ncaa women's division i basketball championship is also popular ) , whereas strongest european clubs participate in the euroleague women .
in early december *num* , canadian james naismith , a physical education professor and instructor at the international young men's christian association training school ( ymca ) ( today , springfield college ) in springfield , massachusetts , was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day .
he sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long new england winters .
after rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums , he wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto a elevated track .
in contrast with modern basketball nets , this peach basket retained its bottom , and balls had to be retrieved manually after each " basket " or point scored ; this proved inefficient , however , so the bottom of the basket was removed , allowing the balls to be poked out with a long dowel each time .
basketball was originally played with a soccer ball .
these round balls from " association football " were made , at the time , with a set of laces to close off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable bladder after the other sewn-together segments of the ball's cover had been flipped outside-in .
these laces could cause bounce passes and dribbling to be unpredictable .
eventually a lace-free ball construction method was invented , and this change to the game was endorsed by naismith .
( whereas in american football , the lace construction proved to be advantageous for gripping and remains to this day .
) the first balls made specifically for basketball were brown , and it was only in the late 1950s that tony hinkle , searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike , introduced the orange ball that is now in common use .
dribbling was not part of the original game except for the " bounce pass " to teammates .
passing the ball was the primary means of ball movement .
dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls .
dribbling only became a major part of the game around the 1950s , as manufacturing improved the ball shape .
the peach baskets were used until *num* when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards .
a further change was soon made , so the ball merely passed through .
whenever a person got the ball in the basket , his team would gain a point .
whichever team got the most points won the game .
the baskets were originally nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the playing court , but this proved impractical when spectators in the balcony began to interfere with shots .
the backboard was introduced to prevent this interference ; it had the additional effect of allowing rebound shots .
naismith's handwritten diaries , discovered by his granddaughter in early *num* , indicate that he was nervous about the new game he had invented , which incorporated rules from a children's game called duck on a rock , as many had failed before it .
frank mahan , one of the players from the original first game , approached naismith after the christmas break , in early *num* , asking him what he intended to call his new game .
naismith replied that he hadn't thought of it because he had been focused on just getting the game started .
mahan suggested that it be called " naismith ball " , at which he laughed , saying that a name like that would kill any game .
mahan then said , " why not call it basketball ? " naismith replied , " we have a basket and a ball , and it seems to me that would be a good name for it .
" the first official game was played in the ymca gymnasium in albany , new york , on january *num* , *num* , with nine players .
the game ended at 1–0 ; the shot was made from , on a court just half the size of a present-day streetball or national basketball association ( nba ) court .
at the time , football was being played with *num* to a team ( which was increased to *num* ) .
when winter weather got too icy to play football , teams were taken indoors , and it was convenient to have them split in half and play basketball with five on each side .
by 1897–1898 teams of five became standard .
basketball's early adherents were dispatched to ymcas throughout the united states , and it quickly spread through the united states and canada .
by *num* , it was well established at several women's high schools .
while the ymca was responsible for initially developing and spreading the game , within a decade it discouraged the new sport , as rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from the ymca's primary mission .
however , other amateur sports clubs , colleges , and professional clubs quickly filled the void .
in the years before world war i , the amateur athletic union and the intercollegiate athletic association of the united states ( forerunner of the ncaa ) vied for control over the rules for the game .
the first pro league , the national basketball league , was formed in *num* to protect players from exploitation and to promote a less rough game .
this league only lasted five years .
james naismith was instrumental in establishing college basketball .
his colleague c .
o .
beamis fielded the first college basketball team just a year after the springfield ymca game at the suburban pittsburgh geneva college .
naismith himself later coached at the university of kansas for six years , before handing the reins to renowned coach forrest " phog " allen .
naismith's disciple amos alonzo stagg brought basketball to the university of chicago , while adolph rupp , a student of naismith's at kansas , enjoyed great success as coach at the university of kentucky .
on february *num* , *num* , the first intercollegiate 5-on-5 game was played at hamline university between hamline and the school of agriculture , which was affiliated with the university of minnesota .
the school of agriculture won in a 9–3 game .
in *num* , colleges , including the university of chicago , columbia university , cornell university , dartmouth college , the university of minnesota , the u .
s .
naval academy , the university of colorado and yale university began sponsoring men's games .
in *num* , frequent injuries on the football field prompted president theodore roosevelt to suggest that colleges form a governing body , resulting in the creation of the intercollegiate athletic association of the united states ( iaaus ) .
in *num* , that body would change its name to the national collegiate athletic association ( ncaa ) .
the first canadian interuniversity basketball game was played at the ymca in kingston , ontario on february *num* , *num* , when mcgill university—naismith's alma mater—visited queen's university .
mcgill won 9–7 in overtime ; the score was 7–7 at the end of regulation play , and a ten-minute overtime period settled the outcome .
a good turnout of spectators watched the game .
the first men's national championship tournament , the national association of intercollegiate basketball tournament , which still exists as the national association of intercollegiate athletics ( naia ) tournament , was organized in *num* .
the first national championship for ncaa teams , the national invitation tournament ( nit ) in new york , was organized in *num* ; the ncaa national tournament would begin one year later .
college basketball was rocked by gambling scandals from *num* to *num* , when dozens of players from top teams were implicated in match fixing and point shaving .
partially spurred by an association with cheating , the nit lost support to the ncaa tournament .
before widespread school district consolidation , most american high schools were far smaller than their present-day counterparts .
during the first decades of the *ord* century , basketball quickly became the ideal interscholastic sport due to its modest equipment and personnel requirements .
in the days before widespread television coverage of professional and college sports , the popularity of high school basketball was unrivaled in many parts of america .
perhaps the most legendary of high school teams was indiana's franklin wonder five , which took the nation by storm during the 1920s , dominating indiana basketball and earning national recognition .
today virtually every high school in the united states fields a basketball team in varsity competition .
basketball's popularity remains high , both in rural areas where they carry the identification of the entire community , as well as at some larger schools known for their basketball teams where many players go on to participate at higher levels of competition after graduation .
in the 2016–17 season , *num* , *num* boys and girls represented their schools in interscholastic basketball competition , according to the national federation of state high school associations .
the states of illinois , indiana and kentucky are particularly well known for their residents ' devotion to high school basketball , commonly called hoosier hysteria in indiana ; the critically acclaimed film " hoosiers " shows high school basketball's depth of meaning to these communities .
there is currently no tournament to determine a national high school champion .
the most serious effort was the national interscholastic basketball tournament at the university of chicago from *num* to *num* .
the event was organized by amos alonzo stagg and sent invitations to state champion teams .
the tournament started out as a mostly midwest affair but grew .
in *num* it had *num* state champions .
faced with opposition from the national federation of state high school associations and north central association of colleges and schools that bore a threat of the schools losing their accreditation the last tournament was in *num* .
the organizations said they were concerned that the tournament was being used to recruit professional players from the prep ranks .
the tournament did not invite minority schools or private / parochial schools .
the national catholic interscholastic basketball tournament ran from *num* to *num* at loyola university .
the national catholic invitational basketball tournament from *num* to *num* played at a series of venues , including catholic university , georgetown and george mason .
the national interscholastic basketball tournament for black high schools was held from *num* to *num* at hampton institute .
the national invitational interscholastic basketball tournament was held from *num* to *num* starting out at tuskegee institute .
following a pause during world war ii it resumed at tennessee state college in nashville .
the basis for the champion dwindled after *num* when " brown v .
board of education " began an integration of schools .
the last tournaments were held at alabama state college from *num* to *num* .
teams abounded throughout the 1920s .
there were hundreds of men's professional basketball teams in towns and cities all over the united states , and little organization of the professional game .
players jumped from team to team and teams played in armories and smoky dance halls .
leagues came and went .
barnstorming squads such as the original celtics and two all-african american teams , the new york renaissance five ( " rens " ) and the ( still existing ) harlem globetrotters played up to two hundred games a year on their national tours .
in *num* , the basketball association of america ( baa ) was formed .
the first game was played in toronto , ontario , canada between the toronto huskies and new york knickerbockers on november *num* , *num* .
three seasons later , in *num* , the baa merged with the national basketball league ( nbl ) to form the national basketball association ( nba ) .
by the 1950s , basketball had become a major college sport , thus paving the way for a growth of interest in professional basketball .
in *num* , a basketball hall of fame was founded in springfield , massachusetts , site of the first game .
its rosters include the names of great players , coaches , referees and people who have contributed significantly to the development of the game .
the hall of fame has people who have accomplished many goals in their career in basketball .
an upstart organization , the american basketball association , emerged in *num* and briefly threatened the nba's dominance until the aba-nba merger in *num* .
today the nba is the top professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity , salaries , talent , and level of competition .
the nba has featured many famous players , including george mikan , the first dominating " big man " ; ball-handling wizard bob cousy and defensive genius bill russell of the boston celtics ; charismatic center wilt chamberlain , who originally played for the barnstorming harlem globetrotters ; all-around stars oscar robertson and jerry west ; more recent big men kareem abdul-jabbar , shaquille o'neal , hakeem olajuwon and karl malone ; playmakers john stockton , isiah thomas and steve nash ; crowd-pleasing forwards julius erving and charles barkley ; european stars dirk nowitzki , pau gasol and tony parker ; more recent superstars lebron james , allen iverson and kobe bryant ; and the three players who many credit with ushering the professional game to its highest level of popularity during the 1980s and 1990s : larry bird , earvin " magic " johnson , and michael jordan .
in *num* , the nba formed a developmental league , the national basketball development league ( later known as the nba d-league and then the nba g league after a branding deal with gatorade ) .
as of the 2018–19 season , the g league has *num* teams .
fiba ( international basketball federation ) was formed in *num* by eight founding nations : argentina , czechoslovakia , greece , italy , latvia , portugal , romania and switzerland .
at this time , the organization only oversaw amateur players .
its acronym , derived from the french " fédération internationale de basket-ball amateur " , was thus " fiba " .
men's basketball was first included at the berlin *num* summer olympics , although a demonstration tournament was held in *num* .
the united states defeated canada in the first final , played outdoors .
this competition has usually been dominated by the united states , whose team has won all but three titles .
the first of these came in a controversial final game in munich in *num* against the soviet union , in which the ending of the game was replayed three times until the soviet union finally came out on top .
in *num* the first fiba world championship for men , now known as the fiba basketball world cup , was held in argentina .
three years later , the first fiba world championship for women , now known as the fiba women's basketball world cup , was held in chile .
women's basketball was added to the olympics in *num* , which were held in montreal , quebec , canada with teams such as the soviet union , brazil and australia rivaling the american squads .
in *num* , fiba allowed professional nba players to participate in the olympics for the first time .
prior to the *num* summer olympics , only european and south american teams were allowed to field professionals in the olympics .
the united states ' dominance continued with the introduction of the original dream team .
in the *num* athens olympics , the united states suffered its first olympic loss while using professional players , falling to puerto rico ( in a 19-point loss ) and lithuania in group games , and being eliminated in the semifinals by argentina .
it eventually won the bronze medal defeating lithuania , finishing behind argentina and italy .
the redeem team , won gold at the *num* olympics , and the b-team , won gold at the *num* fiba world championship in turkey despite featuring no players from the *num* squad .
the united states continued its dominance as they won gold at the *num* olympics , *num* fiba world cup and the *num* olympics .
worldwide , basketball tournaments are held for boys and girls of all age levels .
the global popularity of the sport is reflected in the nationalities represented in the nba .
players from all six inhabited continents currently play in the nba .
top international players began coming into the nba in the mid-1990s , including croatians dražen petrović and toni kukoč , serbian vlade divac , lithuanians arvydas sabonis and šarūnas marčiulionis , dutchman rik smits and german detlef schrempf .
in the philippines , the philippine basketball association's first game was played on april *num* , *num* at the araneta coliseum in cubao , quezon city .
philippines .
it was founded as a " rebellion " of several teams from the now-defunct manila industrial and commercial athletic association , which was tightly controlled by the basketball association of the philippines ( now defunct ) , the then-fiba recognized national association .
nine teams from the micaa participated in the league's first season that opened on april *num* , *num* .
the nbl is australia's pre-eminent men's professional basketball league .
the league commenced in *num* , playing a winter season ( april–september ) and did so until the completion of the *ord* season in *num* .
the 1998–99 season , which commenced only months later , was the first season after the shift to the current summer season format ( october–april ) .
this shift was an attempt to avoid competing directly against australia's various football codes .
it features *num* teams from around australia and one in new zealand .
a few players including luc longley , andrew gaze , shane heal , chris anstey and andrew bogut made it big internationally , becoming poster figures for the sport in australia .
the women's national basketball league began in *num* .
women's basketball began in *num* at smith college when senda berenson , a physical education teacher , modified naismith's rules for women .
shortly after she was hired at smith , she went to naismith to learn more about the game .
fascinated by the new sport and the values it could teach , she organized the first women's collegiate basketball game on march *num* , *num* , when her smith freshmen and sophomores played against one another .
however , the first women's interinstitutional game was played in *num* between the university of california and miss head's school .
berenson's rules were first published in *num* , and two years later she became the editor of a .
g .
spalding's first women's basketball guide .
berenson's freshmen played the sophomore class in the first women's intercollegiate basketball game at smith college , march *num* , *num* .
the same year , mount holyoke and sophie newcomb college ( coached by clara gregory baer ) women began playing basketball .

the edmonton grads , a touring canadian women's team based in edmonton , alberta , operated between *num* and *num* .
the grads toured all over north america , and were exceptionally successful .
they posted a record of *num* wins and only *num* losses over that span , as they met any team that wanted to challenge them , funding their tours from gate receipts .
the grads also shone on several exhibition trips to europe , and won four consecutive exhibition olympics tournaments , in *num* , *num* , *num* , and *num* ; however , women's basketball was not an official olympic sport until *num* .
the grads ' players were unpaid , and had to remain single .

the first women's aau all-america team was chosen in *num* .
women's industrial leagues sprang up throughout the united states , producing famous athletes , including babe didrikson of the golden cyclones , and the all american red heads team , which competed against men's teams , using men's rules .
by *num* , the women's national championship changed from a three-court game to two-court game with six players per team .
the nba-backed women's national basketball association ( wnba ) began in *num* .
though it had shaky attendance figures , several marquee players ( lisa leslie , diana taurasi , and candace parker among others ) have helped the league's popularity and level of competition .
other professional women's basketball leagues in the united states , such as the american basketball league ( 1996–98 ) , have folded in part because of the popularity of the wnba .
the wnba has been looked at by many as a niche league .
however , the league has recently taken steps forward .
in june *num* , the wnba signed a contract extension with espn .
the new television deal ran from *num* to *num* .
along with this deal , came the first ever rights fees to be paid to a women's professional sports league .
over the eight years of the contract , " millions and millions of dollars " were " dispersed to the league's teams .
" in a march *num* , *num* article , nba commissioner david stern said that in the bad economy , " the nba is far less profitable than the wnba .
we're losing a lot of money among a large number of teams .
we're budgeting the wnba to break even this year .
" measurements and time limits discussed in this section often vary among tournaments and organizations ; international and nba rules are used in this section .
the object of the game is to outscore one's opponents by throwing the ball through the opponents ' basket from above while preventing the opponents from doing so on their own .
an attempt to score in this way is called a shot .
a successful shot is worth two points , or three points if it is taken from beyond the three-point arc from the basket in international games and in nba games .
a one-point shot can be earned when shooting from the foul line after a foul is made .
games are played in four quarters of *num* ( fiba ) or *num* minutes ( nba ) .
college men's games use two 20-minute halves , college women's games use 10-minute quarters , and most united states high school varsity games use *num* minute quarters , however , this varies from state to state .
*num* minutes are allowed for a half-time break under fiba , nba , and ncaa rules and *num* minutes in united states high schools .
overtime periods are five minutes in length except for high school , which is four minutes in length .
teams exchange baskets for the second half .
the time allowed is actual playing time ; the clock is stopped while the play is not active .
therefore , games generally take much longer to complete than the allotted game time , typically about two hours .
five players from each team may be on the court at one time .
substitutions are unlimited but can only be done when play is stopped .
teams also have a coach , who oversees the development and strategies of the team , and other team personnel such as assistant coaches , managers , statisticians , doctors and trainers .
for both men's and women's teams , a standard uniform consists of a pair of shorts and a jersey with a clearly visible number , unique within the team , printed on both the front and back .
players wear high-top sneakers that provide extra ankle support .
typically , team names , players ' names and , outside of north america , sponsors are printed on the uniforms .
a limited number of time-outs , clock stoppages requested by a coach ( or sometimes mandated in the nba ) for a short meeting with the players , are allowed .
they generally last no longer than one minute ( *num* seconds in the nba ) unless , for televised games , a commercial break is needed .
the game is controlled by the officials consisting of the referee ( referred to as crew chief in the nba ) , one or two umpires ( referred to as referees in the nba ) and the table officials .
for college , the nba , and many high schools , there are a total of three referees on the court .
the table officials are responsible for keeping track of each teams scoring , timekeeping , individual and team fouls , player substitutions , team possession arrow , and the shot clock .
the only essential equipment in a basketball game is the ball and the court : a flat , rectangular surface with baskets at opposite ends .
competitive levels require the use of more equipment such as clocks , score sheets , scoreboard ( s ) , alternating possession arrows , and whistle-operated stop-clock systems .
a regulation basketball court in international games is long and *num* .
*num* feet ( *num* meters ) wide .
in the nba and ncaa the court is .
most courts have wood flooring , usually constructed from maple planks running in the same direction as the longer court dimension .
the name and logo of the home team is usually painted on or around the center circle .
the basket is a steel rim diameter with an attached net affixed to a backboard that measures and one basket is at each end of the court .
the white outlined box on the backboard is high and wide .
at almost all levels of competition , the top of the rim is exactly above the court and inside the baseline .
while variation is possible in the dimensions of the court and backboard , it is considered important for the basket to be of the correct height – a rim that is off by just a few inches can have an adverse effect on shooting .
the size of the basketball is also regulated .
for men , the official ball is in circumference ( size *num* , or a " *num* ball " ) and weighs *num* oz ( *num* .
*num* grams ) .
if women are playing , the official basketball size is in circumference ( size *num* , or a " *num* ball " ) with a weight of *num* oz ( *num* grams ) .
in 3x3 , a formalized version of the halfcourt 3-on-3 game , a dedicated ball with the circumference of a size *num* ball but the weight of a size *num* ball is used in all competitions ( men's , women's , and mixed teams ) .
the ball may be advanced toward the basket by being shot , passed between players , thrown , tapped , rolled or dribbled ( bouncing the ball while running ) .
the ball must stay within the court ; the last team to touch the ball before it travels out of bounds forfeits possession .
the ball is out of bounds if it touches a boundary line , or touches any player or object that is out of bounds .
there are limits placed on the steps a player may take without dribbling , which commonly results in an infraction known as traveling .
nor may a player stop his dribble and then resume dribbling .
a dribble that touches both hands is considered stopping the dribble , giving this infraction the name double dribble .
within a dribble , the player cannot carry the ball by placing his hand on the bottom of the ball ; doing so is known as carrying the ball .
a team , once having established ball control in the front half of their court , may not return the ball to the backcourt and be the first to touch it .
a violation of these rules results in loss of possession .
the ball may not be kicked , nor be struck with the fist .
for the offense , a violation of these rules results in loss of possession ; for the defense , most leagues reset the shot clock and the offensive team is given possession of the ball out of bounds .
there are limits imposed on the time taken before progressing the ball past halfway ( *num* seconds in fiba and the nba ; *num* seconds in ncaa and high school for both sexes ) , before attempting a shot ( *num* seconds in fiba , the nba , and u sports ( canadian universities ) play for both sexes , and *num* seconds in ncaa play for both sexes ) , holding the ball while closely guarded ( *num* seconds ) , and remaining in the restricted area known as the free-throw lane , ( or the " key " ) ( *num* seconds ) .
these rules are designed to promote more offense .
basket interference , or goaltending is a violation charged when a player illegally interferes with a shot .
this violation is incurred when a player touches the ball on its downward trajectory to the basket , unless it is obvious that the ball has no chance of entering the basket , if a player touches the ball while it is in the rim , or in the area extended upwards from the basket , or if a player reaches through the basket to interfere with the shot .
when a defensive player is charged with goaltending , the basket is awarded .
if an offensive player commits the infraction , the basket is cancelled .
in either case possession of the ball is turned over to the defensive team .
an attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through certain types of physical contact is illegal and is called a personal foul .
these are most commonly committed by defensive players ; however , they can be committed by offensive players as well .
players who are fouled either receive the ball to pass inbounds again , or receive one or more free throws if they are fouled in the act of shooting , depending on whether the shot was successful .
one point is awarded for making a free throw , which is attempted from a line from the basket .
the referee is responsible for judging whether contact is illegal , sometimes resulting in controversy .
the calling of fouls can vary between games , leagues and referees .
there is a second category of fouls called technical fouls , which may be charged for various rules violations including failure to properly record a player in the scorebook , or for unsportsmanlike conduct .
these infractions result in one or two free throws , which may be taken by any of the five players on the court at the time .
repeated incidents can result in disqualification .
a blatant foul involving physical contact that is either excessive or unnecessary is called an intentional foul ( flagrant foul in the nba ) .
in fiba and ncaa women's basketball , a foul resulting in ejection is called a disqualifying foul , while in leagues other than the nba , such a foul is referred to as flagrant .
if a team exceeds a certain limit of team fouls in a given period ( quarter or half ) – four for nba , ncaa women's , and international games – the opposing team is awarded one or two free throws on all subsequent non-shooting fouls for that period , the number depending on the league .
in the us college men's game and high school games for both sexes , if a team reaches *num* fouls in a half , the opposing team is awarded one free throw , along with a second shot if the first is made .
this is called shooting " one-and-one " .
if a team exceeds *num* fouls in the half , the opposing team is awarded two free throws on all subsequent fouls for the half .
when a team shoots foul shots , the opponents may not interfere with the shooter , nor may they try to regain possession until the last or potentially last free throw is in the air .
after a team has committed a specified number of fouls , the other team is said to be " in the bonus " .
on scoreboards , this is usually signified with an indicator light reading " bonus " or " penalty " with an illuminated directional arrow or dot indicating that team is to receive free throws when fouled by the opposing team .
( some scoreboards also indicate the number of fouls committed .
) if a team misses the first shot of a two-shot situation , the opposing team must wait for the completion of the second shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the ball and continuing play .
if a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is unsuccessful , the player is awarded a number of free throws equal to the value of the attempted shot .
a player fouled while attempting a regular two-point shot thus receives two shots , and a player fouled while attempting a three-point shot receives three shots .
if a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is successful , typically the player will be awarded one additional free throw for one point .
in combination with a regular shot , this is called a " three-point play " or " four-point play " ( or more colloquially , an " and one " ) because of the basket made at the time of the foul ( *num* or *num* points ) and the additional free throw ( *num* point ) .
although the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever , they have evolved as part of basketball .
during the early years of basketball's evolution , two guards , two forwards , and one center were used .
in more recent times specific positions evolved , but the current trend , advocated by many top coaches including mike krzyzewski is towards positionless basketball , where big guys are free to shoot from outside and dribble if their skill allows it .
popular descriptions of positions include : point guard ( often called the " *num* " ) : usually the fastest player on the team , organizes the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time .
shooting guard ( the " *num* " ) : creates a high volume of shots on offense , mainly long-ranged ; and guards the opponent's best perimeter player on defense .
small forward ( the " *num* " ) : often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the basket and dribble penetration ; on defense seeks rebounds and steals , but sometimes plays more actively .
power forward ( the " *num* " ) : plays offensively often with their back to the basket ; on defense , plays under the basket ( in a zone defense ) or against the opposing power forward ( in man-to-man defense ) .
center ( the " *num* " ) : uses height and size to score ( on offense ) , to protect the basket closely ( on defense ) , or to rebound .
the above descriptions are flexible .
for most teams today , the shooting guard and small forward have very similar responsibilities and are often called the wings , as do the power forward and center , who are often called post players .
while most teams describe two players as guards , two as forwards , and one as a center , on some occasions teams choose to call them by different designations .
there are two main defensive strategies : " zone defense " and " man-to-man defense " .
in a zone defense , each player is assigned to guard a specific area of the court .
zone defenses often allow the defense to double team the ball , a manoeuver known as a trap .
in a man-to-man defense , each defensive player guards a specific opponent .
offensive plays are more varied , normally involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball .
a quick movement by an offensive player without the ball to gain an advantageous position is known as a " cut " .
a legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent from guarding a teammate , by standing in the defender's way such that the teammate cuts next to him , is a " screen " or " pick " .
the two plays are combined in the " pick and roll " , in which a player sets a pick and then " rolls " away from the pick towards the basket .
screens and cuts are very important in offensive plays ; these allow the quick passes and teamwork , which can lead to a successful basket .
teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable .
on court , the point guard is usually responsible for indicating which play will occur .
shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket , methods varying with players and situations .
typically , a player faces the basket with both feet facing the basket .
a player will rest the ball on the fingertips of the dominant hand ( the shooting arm ) slightly above the head , with the other hand supporting the side of the ball .
the ball is usually shot by jumping ( though not always ) and extending the shooting arm .
the shooting arm , fully extended with the wrist fully bent , is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball , known as a " follow-through " .
players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim .
the ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial , but generally a proper arc is recommended .
players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket .
the two most common shots that use the above described setup are the " set shot " and the " jump shot " .
the set shot is taken from a standing position , with neither foot leaving the floor , typically used for free throws , and in other circumstances while the jump shot is taken in mid-air , the ball released near the top of the jump .
this provides much greater power and range , and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender .
failure to release the ball before the feet return to the floor is considered a traveling violation .
another common shot is called the " lay-up " .
this shot requires the player to be in motion toward the basket , and to " lay " the ball " up " and into the basket , typically off the backboard ( the backboard-free , underhand version is called a " finger roll " ) .
the most crowd-pleasing and typically highest-percentage accuracy shot is the " slam dunk " , in which the player jumps very high and throws the ball downward , through the basket while touching it .
another shot that is becoming common is the " circus shot " .
the circus shot is a low-percentage shot that is flipped , heaved , scooped , or flung toward the hoop while the shooter is off-balance , airborne , falling down , and / or facing away from the basket .
a back-shot is a shot taken when the player is facing away from the basket , and may be shot with the dominant hand , or both ; but there is a very low chance that the shot will be successful .
a shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is referred to as an " air ball " .
a particularly bad shot , or one that only hits the backboard , is jocularly called a brick .
the " hang time " is the length of time a player stays in the air after jumping , either to make a slam dunk , lay-up or jump shot .
the objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw , as it rebounds from the hoop or backboard .
this plays a major role in the game , as most possessions end when a team misses a shot .
there are two categories of rebounds : offensive rebounds , in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession , and defensive rebounds , in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball .
the majority of rebounds are defensive , as the team on defense tends to be in better position to recover missed shots .
a pass is a method of moving the ball between players .
most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy .
a staple pass is the " chest pass " .
the ball is passed directly from the passer's chest to the receiver's chest .
a proper chest pass involves an outward snap of the thumbs to add velocity and leaves the defence little time to react .
another type of pass is the " bounce pass " .
here , the passer bounces the ball crisply about two-thirds of the way from his own chest to the receiver .
the ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver .
the bounce pass takes longer to complete than the chest pass , but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept ( kicking the ball deliberately is a violation ) .
thus , players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments , or to pass around a defender .
the " overhead pass " is used to pass the ball over a defender .
the ball is released while over the passer's head .
the " outlet pass " occurs after a team gets a defensive rebound .
the next pass after the rebound is the " outlet pass " .
the crucial aspect of any good pass is it being difficult to intercept .
good passers can pass the ball with great accuracy and they know exactly where each of their other teammates prefers to receive the ball .
a special way of doing this is passing the ball without looking at the receiving teammate .
this is called a " no-look pass " .
another advanced style of passing is the " behind-the-back pass " , which , as the description implies , involves throwing the ball behind the passer's back to a teammate .
although some players can perform such a pass effectively , many coaches discourage no-look or behind-the-back passes , believing them to be difficult to control and more likely to result in turnovers or violations .
dribbling is the act of bouncing the ball continuously with one hand , and is a requirement for a player to take steps with the ball .
to dribble , a player pushes the ball down towards the ground with the fingertips rather than patting it ; this ensures greater control .
when dribbling past an opponent , the dribbler should dribble with the hand farthest from the opponent , making it more difficult for the defensive player to get to the ball .
it is therefore important for a player to be able to dribble competently with both hands .
good dribblers ( or " ball handlers " ) tend to bounce the ball low to the ground , reducing the distance of travel of the ball from the floor to the hand , making it more difficult for the defender to " steal " the ball .
good ball handlers frequently dribble behind their backs , between their legs , and switch directions suddenly , making a less predictable dribbling pattern that is more difficult to defend against .
this is called a crossover , which is the most effective way to move past defenders while dribbling .
a skilled player can dribble without watching the ball , using the dribbling motion or peripheral vision to keep track of the ball's location .
by not having to focus on the ball , a player can look for teammates or scoring opportunities , as well as avoid the danger of having someone steal the ball away from him / her .
a block is performed when , after a shot is attempted , a defender succeeds in altering the shot by touching the ball .
in almost all variants of play , it is illegal to touch the ball after it is in the downward path of its arc ; this is known as " goaltending " .
it is also illegal under nba and men's ncaa basketball to block a shot after it has touched the backboard , or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim .
under international rules it is illegal to block a shot that is in the downward path of its arc or one that has touched the backboard until the ball has hit the rim .
after the ball hits the rim , it is again legal to touch it even though it is no longer considered as a block performed .
to block a shot , a player has to be able to reach a point higher than where the shot is released .
thus , height can be an advantage in blocking .
players who are taller and playing the power forward or center positions generally record more blocks than players who are shorter and playing the guard positions .
however , with good timing and a sufficiently high vertical leap , even shorter players can be effective shot blockers .
at the professional level , most male players are above and most women above .
guards , for whom physical coordination and ball-handling skills are crucial , tend to be the smallest players .
almost all forwards in the top men's pro leagues are or taller .
most centers are over tall .
according to a survey given to all nba teams , the average height of all nba players is just under , with the average weight being close to .
the tallest players ever in the nba were manute bol and gheorghe mureșan , who were both tall .
the tallest current nba player is sim bhullar , who stands at .
at , margo dydek was the tallest player in the history of the wnba .
the shortest player ever to play in the nba is muggsy bogues at .
other short players have thrived at the pro level .
anthony " spud " webb was just tall , but had a vertical leap , giving him significant height when jumping .
while shorter players are often at a disadvantage in certain aspects of the game , their ability to navigate quickly through crowded areas of the court and steal the ball by reaching low are strengths .
it should be noted that players regularly inflate their height .
many prospects exaggerate their height while in high school or college to make themselves more appealing to coaches and scouts , who prefer taller players .
charles barkley stated ; " i've been measured at 6-5 , 6-4 .
but i started in college at 6-6 .
" sam smith , former writer from the chicago tribune , said : " we sort of know the heights , because after camp , the sheet comes out .
but you use that height , and the player gets mad .
and then you hear from his agent .
or you file your story with the right height , and the copy desk changes it because they have the ' official ' n .
b .
a .
media guide , which is wrong .
so you sort of go along with the joke .
" in the nba , there is no standard on whether a player's listed height uses their measurement with shoes on or without .
the nba draft combine , which most players attend before the draft , provides both measurements .
thereafter , a player's team is solely responsible for their listed height , which can vary depending on the process selected .
notable players who overstated their height include : on rare occasions , some players will understate their actual heights , not to be repositioned .
one example is kevin durant , who's listed height , while his actual height is .
durants ' reasoning was , " really , that's the prototypical size for a small forward .
anything taller than that , and they'll start saying , ' ah , he's a power forward .
" the composition of race and ethnicity in the national basketball association ( nba ) has changed throughout the league's history .
for the 2014-2015 season , international players comprised *num* .
*num* percent of nba rosters .
the same year , the racial breakdown of the nba was : the first non-white player entered the league in *num* .
wataru misaka debuted in 1947–48 as the first non-white player and the first player of asian descent to play in the league .
yao ming became the first east asian first overall pick , when he was selected by the houston rockets in the *num* nba draft .
in *num* , richard lapchick with the institute for diversity and ethics in sport ( tides ) of the university of central florida reported in their annual " racial and gender report card " that *num* percent of the league's players were white , the lowest since the report began in *num* .
hall of fame player and indiana pacers president of basketball operations larry bird , who is white , stated in *num* that the league needed more white players since the league's fans are mostly white .
" and if you just had a couple of white guys in there , you might get them [ the fans , not the guys ] a little excited .
but it is a black man's game , and it will be forever .
i mean , the greatest athletes in the world are african-american , " said bird .
more recently , a number of commentators have remarked on the league's dwindling number of white american players .
while a tides study found that the nba was *num* .
*num* % white in the 2015–16 season , this number also included non-americans , most notably europeans .
during the entire 1996–97 season , only three nba teams did not field an american-born white ; on the opening day of the 2016–17 season , eight teams did not have a white american on their roster , and an additional *num* teams had only one .
at the latter point in time , fewer than *num* % of nba players were american-born whites ( *num* out of a possible *num* ) .
these proportions have been suggested to be the result of basketball's relatively minor importance in white american culture .
, white interest in the nba remains the lowest among all racial groups , with african americans and asian americans spending the most time watching basketball , followed by hispanics ( of any race ) .
furthermore , according to a nielsen's survey , the nba has the highest share of black viewers , with *num* percent of its viewers being black and only about *num* percent of viewers being white , making it the only top north american sport that doesn't have a white majority audience .
variations of basketball are activities based on the game of basketball , using common basketball skills and equipment ( primarily the ball and basket ) .
some variations are only superficial rules changes , while others are distinct games with varying degrees of basketball influences .
other variations include children's games , contests or activities meant to help players reinforce skills .
there are principal basketball sports with variations on basketball including wheelchair basketball , water basketball , beach basketball , slamball , streetball and unicycle basketball .
an earlier version of basketball , played primarily by women and girls , was six-on-six basketball .
horseball is a game played on horseback where a ball is handled and points are scored by shooting it through a high net ( approximately *num* .
5m×1 .
5m ) .
the sport is like a combination of polo , rugby , and basketball .
there is even a form played on donkeys known as donkey basketball , but that version has come under attack from animal rights groups .
there are also other basketball sports , such as : beach basketball has grown to a very popular , widespread competitive sport .
*num* annual world championships have been organized .
spin-offs from basketball that are now separate sports include : basketball has been adopted by various social groups , which have established their own environments and sometimes their own rules .
such socialized forms of basketball include the following .
fantasy basketball was popularized during the 1990s after the advent of the internet .
those who play this game are sometimes referred to as general managers , who draft actual nba players and compute their basketball statistics .
the game was popularized by espn fantasy sports , nba .

other sports websites provided the same format keeping the game interesting with participants actually owning specific players .
dual alliance ( *num* ) the dual alliance was a defensive alliance between germany and austria-hungary , which was created by treaty on *num* october *num* as part of bismarck's system of alliances to prevent or limit war .
the two powers promised each other support in case of attack by russia .
also , each state promised benevolent neutrality to the other if one of them was attacked by another european power ( generally taken to be france , even more so after the franco-russian alliance of *num* ) .
germany's otto von bismarck saw the alliance as a way to prevent the isolation of the german empire , which had just been founded a few years before , and to preserve peace , as russia would not wage war against both empires .
when austria-hungary and germany formed an alliance in *num* , it was one of the more surprising alliances of its time .
though both realms shared the german language and a similar culture , austria-hungary and germany were often driven apart , most notably in the recent austro-prussian war .
additionally , the habsburg rulers of austria believed that the promotion of nationalism , which was favored by germany , would destroy their multinational empire .
however , their common dislike for russia brought the two nations together for a common cause .
after the formation of the german empire in *num* , german chancellor otto von bismarck wanted to portray his nation as a peacemaker and preserver of the european status quo , as well as gain more power for the german empire and unify germany .
in *num* , russia defeated the ottoman empire in the russo-turkish war ; the resulting treaty of san stefano gave russia considerable influence in the balkans .
this development outraged austria-hungary , russia's chief rival in the balkan region ( despite being an ally of the russians and the germans in the league of the three emperors ) .
hence , in *num* , bismarck called an international conference ( the congress of berlin ) in order to sort out the problem .
the treaty of berlin that resulted from the conference reversed russia's gains from the treaty of san stefano and provided the austrians with compensation in the form of bosnia .
despite bismarck's attempts to play the role of an " honest broker " at the congress of berlin , russo-german relations deteriorated following the conference .
the three emperors ' league was discontinued , and germany and austria-hungary were free to ally with one another against russia .
in *num* , italy lost in the competition with france to establish a colony in " tunis " ( present-day tunisia ) .
to enlist diplomatic support , italy joined germany and austria-hungary to form the " triple alliance " in *num* , which was the first formal war-camp in europe , the second being the triple entente , an informal alliance , formed in *num* .
during world war i , however , italy did not go to war immediately with its allies but stayed neutral .
in *num* , it joined the entente powers and declared war on austria-hungary , and later germany in the subsequent year .
the dual alliance persisted throughout the war , known as the central powers , and ended with their defeat in *num* .
endocarditis endocarditis is an inflammation of the inner layer of the heart , the endocardium .
it usually involves the heart valves .
other structures that may be involved include the interventricular septum , the chordae tendineae , the mural endocardium , or the surfaces of intracardiac devices .
endocarditis is characterized by lesions , known as " vegetations " , which is a mass of platelets , fibrin , microcolonies of microorganisms , and scant inflammatory cells .
in the subacute form of infective endocarditis , the vegetation may also include a center of granulomatous tissue , which may fibrose or calcify .
there are several ways to classify endocarditis .
the simplest classification is based on cause : either " infective " or " non-infective " , depending on whether a microorganism is the source of the inflammation or not .
regardless , the diagnosis of endocarditis is based on clinical features , investigations such as an echocardiogram , and blood cultures demonstrating the presence of endocarditis-causing microorganisms .
signs and symptoms include fever , chills , sweating , malaise , weakness , anorexia , weight loss , splenomegaly , flu-like feeling , cardiac murmur , heart failure , petechia ( red spots on the skin ) , osler's nodes ( subcutaneous nodules found on hands and feet ) , janeway lesions ( nodular lesions on palms and soles ) , and roth's spots ( retinal hemorrhages ) .
infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner surface of the heart , usually the valves .
symptoms may include fever , small areas of bleeding into the skin , heart murmur , feeling tired , and low red blood cells .
complications may include valvular insufficiency , heart failure , stroke , and kidney failure .
the cause is typically a bacterial infection and less commonly a fungal infection .
risk factors include valvular heart disease including rheumatic disease , congenital heart disease , artificial valves , hemodialysis , intravenous drug use , and electronic pacemakers .
the bacterial most commonly involved are streptococci or staphylococci .
diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and supported by blood cultures or ultrasound .
the usefulness of antibiotics following dental procedures for prevention is unclear .
some recommend them in those at high risk .
treatment is generally with intravenous antibiotics .
the choice of antibiotics is based on the blood cultures .
occasionally heart surgery is required .
the number of people affected is about *num* per *num* , *num* per year .
rates , however , vary between regions of the world .
males are affected more often than females .
the risk of death among those infected is about *num* % .
without treatment it is almost universally fatal .
nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis ( nbte ) is most commonly found on previously undamaged valves .
as opposed to infective endocarditis , the vegetations in nbte are small , sterile , and tend to aggregate along the edges of the valve or the cusps .
also unlike infective endocarditis , nbte does not cause an inflammation response from the body .
nbte usually occurs during a hypercoagulable state such as system-wide bacterial infection , or pregnancy , though it is also sometimes seen in patients with venous catheters .
nbte may also occur in patients with cancers , particularly mucinous adenocarcinoma where trousseau syndrome can be encountered .
typically nbte does not cause many problems on its own , but parts of the vegetations may break off and embolize to the heart or brain , or they may serve as a focus where bacteria can lodge , thus causing infective endocarditis .
another form of sterile endocarditis is termed libman–sacks endocarditis ; this form occurs more often in patients with lupus erythematosus and is thought to be due to the deposition of immune complexes .
like nbte , libman-sacks endocarditis involves small vegetations , while infective endocarditis is composed of large vegetations .
these immune complexes precipitate an inflammation reaction , which helps to differentiate it from nbte .
also unlike nbte , libman-sacks endocarditis does not seem to have a preferred location of deposition and may form on the undersurfaces of the valves or even on the endocardium .
alphabet an alphabet is a standard set of letters ( basic written symbols or graphemes ) that represent the phonemes ( basic significant sounds ) of any spoken language it is used to write .
this is in contrast to other types of writing systems , such as syllabaries ( in which each character represents a syllable ) and logographic systems ( in which each character represents a word , morpheme , or semantic unit ) .
the first fully phonemic script , the proto-canaanite script , later known as the phoenician alphabet , is considered to be the first alphabet , and is the ancestor of most modern alphabets , including arabic , greek , latin , cyrillic , hebrew , and possibly brahmic .
peter t .
daniels , however , distinguishes an abugida or alphasyllabary , a set of graphemes that represent consonantal base letters which diacritics modify to represent vowels ( as in devanagari and other south asian scripts ) , an abjad , in which letters predominantly or exclusively represent consonants ( as in the original phoenician , hebrew or arabic ) , and an " alphabet , " a set of graphemes that represent both vowels and consonants .
in this narrow sense of the word the first " true " alphabet was the greek alphabet , which was developed on the basis of the earlier phoenician alphabet .
of the dozens of alphabets in use today , the most popular is the latin alphabet , which was derived from the greek , and which many languages modify by adding letters formed using diacritical marks .
while most alphabets have letters composed of lines ( linear writing ) , there are also exceptions such as the alphabets used in braille .
the khmer alphabet ( for cambodian ) is the longest , with *num* letters .
alphabets are usually associated with a standard ordering of letters .
this makes them useful for purposes of collation , specifically by allowing words to be sorted in alphabetical order .
it also means that their letters can be used as an alternative method of " numbering " ordered items , in such contexts as numbered lists and number placements .
the english word " alphabet " came into middle english from the late latin word " alphabetum " , which in turn originated in the greek ἀλφάβητος ( " alphabētos " ) .
the greek word was made from the first two letters , " alpha " ( α ) and " beta " ( β ) .
the names for the greek letters came from the first two letters of the phoenician alphabet ; " aleph " , which also meant " ox " , and " bet " , which also meant " house " .
sometimes , like in the alphabet song in english , the term " abcs " is used instead of the word " alphabet " ( " now i know my abcs " .
.
.
) .
" knowing one's abcs " , in general , can be used as a metaphor for knowing the basics about anything .
the history of the alphabet started in ancient egypt .
egyptian writing had a set of some *num* hieroglyphs that are called uniliterals , to represent syllables that begin with a single consonant of their language , plus a vowel ( or no vowel ) to be supplied by the native speaker .
these glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for logograms , to write grammatical inflections , and , later , to transcribe loan words and foreign names .
in the middle bronze age , an apparently " alphabetic " system known as the proto-sinaitic script appears in egyptian turquoise mines in the sinai peninsula dated to circa the *ord* century bc , apparently left by canaanite workers .
in *num* , john and deborah darnell discovered an even earlier version of this first alphabet at wadi el-hol dated to circa *num* bc and showing evidence of having been adapted from specific forms of egyptian hieroglyphs that could be dated to circa *num* bc , strongly suggesting that the first alphabet had been developed about that time .
based on letter appearances and names , it is believed to be based on egyptian hieroglyphs .
this script had no characters representing vowels , although originally it probably was a syllabary , but unneeded symbols were discarded .
an alphabetic cuneiform script with *num* signs including three that indicate the following vowel was invented in ugarit before the *ord* century bc .
this script was not used after the destruction of ugarit .
the proto-sinaitic script eventually developed into the phoenician alphabet , which is conventionally called " proto-canaanite " before ca .
*num* bc .
the oldest text in phoenician script is an inscription on the sarcophagus of king ahiram .
this script is the parent script of all western alphabets .
by the tenth century , two other forms can be distinguished , namely canaanite and aramaic .
the aramaic gave rise to the hebrew script .
the south arabian alphabet , a sister script to the phoenician alphabet , is the script from which the ge'ez alphabet ( an abugida ) is descended .
vowelless alphabets , which are not true alphabets , are called abjads , currently exemplified in scripts including arabic , hebrew , and syriac .
the omission of vowels was not always a satisfactory solution and some " weak " consonants are sometimes used to indicate the vowel quality of a syllable ( matres lectionis ) .
these letters have a dual function since they are also used as pure consonants .
the proto-sinaitic or proto-canaanite script and the ugaritic script were the first scripts with a limited number of signs , in contrast to the other widely used writing systems at the time , cuneiform , egyptian hieroglyphs , and linear b .
the phoenician script was probably the first phonemic script and it contained only about two dozen distinct letters , making it a script simple enough for common traders to learn .
another advantage of phoenician was that it could be used to write down many different languages , since it recorded words phonemically .
the script was spread by the phoenicians across the mediterranean .
in greece , the script was modified to add vowels , giving rise to the ancestor of all alphabets in the west .
the vowels have independent letter forms separate from those of consonants ; therefore it was the first true alphabet .
the greeks chose letters representing sounds that did not exist in greek to represent vowels .
vowels are significant in the greek language , and the syllabical linear b script that was used by the mycenaean greeks from the *ord* century bc had *num* symbols , including *num* vowels .
in its early years , there were many variants of the greek alphabet , a situation that caused many different alphabets to evolve from it .
the greek alphabet , in its euboean form , was carried over by greek colonists to the italian peninsula , where it gave rise to a variety of alphabets used to write the italic languages .
one of these became the latin alphabet , which was spread across europe as the romans expanded their empire .
even after the fall of the roman state , the alphabet survived in intellectual and religious works .
it eventually became used for the descendant languages of latin ( the romance languages ) and then for most of the other languages of europe .
some adaptations of the latin alphabet are augmented with ligatures , such as æ in danish and icelandic and ȣ in algonquian ; by borrowings from other alphabets , such as the thorn þ in old english and icelandic , which came from the futhark runes ; and by modifying existing letters , such as the eth ð of old english and icelandic , which is a modified " d " .
other alphabets only use a subset of the latin alphabet , such as hawaiian , and italian , which uses the letters " j , k , x , y " and " w " only in foreign words .
another notable script is elder futhark , which is believed to have evolved out of one of the old italic alphabets .
elder futhark gave rise to a variety of alphabets known collectively as the runic alphabets .
the runic alphabets were used for germanic languages from ad *num* to the late middle ages .
its usage is mostly restricted to engravings on stone and jewelry , although inscriptions have also been found on bone and wood .
these alphabets have since been replaced with the latin alphabet , except for decorative usage for which the runes remained in use until the *ord* century .
the old hungarian script is a contemporary writing system of the hungarians .
it was in use during the entire history of hungary , albeit not as an official writing system .
from the *ord* century it once again became more and more popular .
the glagolitic alphabet was the initial script of the liturgical language old church slavonic and became , together with the greek uncial script , the basis of the cyrillic script .
cyrillic is one of the most widely used modern alphabetic scripts , and is notable for its use in slavic languages and also for other languages within the former soviet union .
cyrillic alphabets include the serbian , macedonian , bulgarian , russian , belarusian and ukrainian .
the glagolitic alphabet is believed to have been created by saints cyril and methodius , while the cyrillic alphabet was invented by clement of ohrid , who was their disciple .
they feature many letters that appear to have been borrowed from or influenced by the greek alphabet and the hebrew alphabet .
the longest european alphabet is the latin-derived slovak alphabet which has *num* letters .
beyond the logographic chinese writing , many phonetic scripts are in existence in asia .
the arabic alphabet , hebrew alphabet , syriac alphabet , and other abjads of the middle east are developments of the aramaic alphabet , but because these writing systems are largely consonant-based they are often not considered true alphabets .
most alphabetic scripts of india and eastern asia are descended from the brahmi script , which is often believed to be a descendant of aramaic .
in korea , the hangul alphabet was created by sejong the great .
hangul is a unique alphabet : it is a featural alphabet , where many of the letters are designed from a sound's place of articulation ( p to look like the widened mouth , l to look like the tongue pulled in , etc .
) ; its design was planned by the government of the day ; and it places individual letters in syllable clusters with equal dimensions , in the same way as chinese characters , to allow for mixed-script writing ( one syllable always takes up one type-space no matter how many letters get stacked into building that one sound-block ) .
zhuyin ( sometimes called " bopomofo " ) is a semi-syllabary used to phonetically transcribe mandarin chinese in the republic of china .
after the later establishment of the people's republic of china and its adoption of hanyu pinyin , the use of zhuyin today is limited , but it is still widely used in taiwan where the republic of china still governs .
zhuyin developed out of a form of chinese shorthand based on chinese characters in the early 1900s and has elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary .
like an alphabet the phonemes of syllable initials are represented by individual symbols , but like a syllabary the phonemes of the syllable finals are not ; rather , each possible final ( excluding the medial glide ) is represented by its own symbol .
for example , " luan " is represented as ㄌㄨㄢ ( " l-u-an " ) , where the last symbol ㄢ represents the entire final " -an " .
while zhuyin is not used as a mainstream writing system , it is still often used in ways similar to a romanization system—that is , for aiding in pronunciation and as an input method for chinese characters on computers and cellphones .
european alphabets , especially latin and cyrillic , have been adapted for many languages of asia .
arabic is also widely used , sometimes as an abjad ( as with urdu and persian ) and sometimes as a complete alphabet ( as with kurdish and uyghur ) .
the term " alphabet " is used by linguists and paleographers in both a wide and a narrow sense .
in the wider sense , an alphabet is a script that is " segmental " at the phoneme level—that is , it has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words .
in the narrower sense , some scholars distinguish " true " alphabets from two other types of segmental script , abjads and abugidas .
these three differ from each other in the way they treat vowels : abjads have letters for consonants and leave most vowels unexpressed ; abugidas are also consonant-based , but indicate vowels with diacritics to or a systematic graphic modification of the consonants .
in alphabets in the narrow sense , on the other hand , consonants and vowels are written as independent letters .
the earliest known alphabet in the wider sense is the wadi el-hol script , believed to be an abjad , which through its successor phoenician is the ancestor of modern alphabets , including arabic , greek , latin ( via the old italic alphabet ) , cyrillic ( via the greek alphabet ) and hebrew ( via aramaic ) .
examples of present-day abjads are the arabic and hebrew scripts ; true alphabets include latin , cyrillic , and korean hangul ; and abugidas are used to write tigrinya , amharic , hindi , and thai .
the canadian aboriginal syllabics are also an abugida rather than a syllabary as their name would imply , since each glyph stands for a consonant that is modified by rotation to represent the following vowel .
( in a true syllabary , each consonant-vowel combination would be represented by a separate glyph .
) all three types may be augmented with syllabic glyphs .
ugaritic , for example , is basically an abjad , but has syllabic letters for .
( these are the only time vowels are indicated .
) cyrillic is basically a true alphabet , but has syllabic letters for ( я , е , ю ) ; coptic has a letter for .
devanagari is typically an abugida augmented with dedicated letters for initial vowels , though some traditions use अ as a zero consonant as the graphic base for such vowels .
the boundaries between the three types of segmental scripts are not always clear-cut .
for example , sorani kurdish is written in the arabic script , which is normally an abjad .
however , in kurdish , writing the vowels is mandatory , and full letters are used , so the script is a true alphabet .
other languages may use a semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics , effectively making them abugidas .
on the other hand , the phagspa script of the mongol empire was based closely on the tibetan abugida , but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks .
although short " a " was not written , as in the indic abugidas , one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet .
conversely , the vowel marks of the tigrinya abugida and the amharic abugida ( ironically , the original source of the term " abugida " ) have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the modifications are no longer systematic and have to be learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental script .
even more extreme , the pahlavi abjad eventually became logographic .
( see below .
) thus the primary classification of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels .
for tonal languages , further classification can be based on their treatment of tone , though names do not yet exist to distinguish the various types .
some alphabets disregard tone entirely , especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load , as in somali and many other languages of africa and the americas .
such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels .
most commonly , tones are indicated with diacritics , the way vowels are treated in abugidas .
this is the case for vietnamese ( a true alphabet ) and thai ( an abugida ) .
in thai , tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant , with diacritics for disambiguation .
in the pollard script , an abugida , vowels are indicated by diacritics , but the placement of the diacritic relative to the consonant is modified to indicate the tone .
more rarely , a script may have separate letters for tones , as is the case for hmong and zhuang .
for most of these scripts , regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used , the most common tone is not marked , just as the most common vowel is not marked in indic abugidas ; in zhuyin not only is one of the tones unmarked , but there is a diacritic to indicate lack of tone , like the virama of indic .
the number of letters in an alphabet can be quite small .
the book pahlavi script , an abjad , had only twelve letters at one point , and may have had even fewer later on .
today the rotokas alphabet has only twelve letters .
( the hawaiian alphabet is sometimes claimed to be as small , but it actually consists of *num* letters , including the ʻokina and five long vowels .
however , hawaiian braille has only *num* letters .
) while rotokas has a small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent ( just eleven ) , book pahlavi was small because many letters had been " conflated"—that is , the graphic distinctions had been lost over time , and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in arabic , another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes .
for example , a comma-shaped letter represented " g " , " d " , " y " , " k " , or " j " .
however , such apparent simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated .
in later pahlavi papyri , up to half of the remaining graphic distinctions of these twelve letters were lost , and the script could no longer be read as a sequence of letters at all , but instead each word had to be learned as a whole—that is , they had become logograms as in egyptian demotic .
the largest segmental script is probably an abugida , devanagari .
when written in devanagari , vedic sanskrit has an alphabet of *num* letters , including the " visarga " mark for final aspiration and special letters for " kš " and " jñ , " though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used .
the hindi alphabet must represent both sanskrit and modern vocabulary , and so has been expanded to *num* with the " khutma " letters ( letters with a dot added ) to represent sounds from persian and english .
thai has a total of *num* symbols , consisting of *num* consonants , *num* vowels and *num* syllabics , not including *num* diacritics for tone marks and one for vowel length .
the largest known abjad is sindhi , with *num* letters .
the largest alphabets in the narrow sense include kabardian and abkhaz ( for cyrillic ) , with *num* and *num* letters , respectively , and slovak ( for the latin script ) , with *num* .
however , these scripts either count di- and tri-graphs as separate letters , as spanish did with " ch " and " ll " until recently , or uses diacritics like slovak " č " .
the georgian alphabet ( " " ) is alphabetical writing system .
it is the largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent with *num* letters .
original georgian alphabet had *num* letters but *num* letters were removed in *ord* century by ilia chavchavadze .
the georgian alphabet is much closer to greek than the other caucasian alphabets .
the numeric value runs parallel to the greek one , the consonants without a greek equivalent are organized at the end of the alphabet .
origins of the alphabet are still unknown , some armenian and western scholars believe it was created by mesrop mashtots ( armenian : մեսրոպ մաշտոց mesrop maštoc ' ) also known as mesrob the vartabed , who was an early medieval armenian linguist , theologian , statesman and hymnologist , best known for inventing the armenian alphabet c .
*num* ad , other georgian and western , scholars are against this theory .
syllabaries typically contain *num* to *num* glyphs , and the glyphs of logographic systems typically number from the many hundreds into the thousands .
thus a simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script .
the armenian alphabet ( ' or ' ) is a graphically unique alphabetical writing system that has been used to write the armenian language .
it was introduced by mesrob mashdots around *num* ad , an armenian linguist and ecclesiastical leader , and originally contained *num* letters .
two more letters , օ ( o ) and ֆ ( f ) , were added in the middle ages .
during the 1920s orthography reform , a new letter և ( capital եվ ) was added , which was a ligature before ե+ւ , while the letter ւ ւ was discarded and reintroduced as part of a new letter ու ու ( which was a digraph before ) .
the armenian word for " alphabet " is " " ( ) , named after the first two letters of the armenian alphabet ա այբ ayb and բ բեն ben .
the armenian script's directionality is horizontal left-to-right , like the latin and greek alphabets .
alphabets often come to be associated with a standard ordering of their letters , which can then be used for purposes of collation—namely for the listing of words and other items in what is called " alphabetical order " .
the basic ordering of the latin alphabet ( a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ) , which is derived from the northwest semitic " abgad " order , is well established , although languages using this alphabet have different conventions for their treatment of modified letters ( such as the french " é " , " à " , and " ô " ) and of certain combinations of letters ( multigraphs ) .
in french , these are not considered to be additional letters for the purposes of collation .
however , in icelandic , the accented letters such as " á " , " í " , and " ö " are considered distinct letters representing different vowel sounds from the sounds represented by their unaccented counterparts .
in spanish , " ñ " is considered a separate letter , but accented vowels such as " á " and " é " are not .
the " ll " and " ch " were also considered single letters , but in *num* the real academia española changed the collating order so that " ll " is between " lk " and " lm " in the dictionary and " ch " is between " cg " and " ci " , and in *num* the tenth congress of the association of spanish language academies changed it so they were no longer letters at all .
in german , words starting with " sch- " ( which spells the german phoneme ) are inserted between words with initial " sca- " and " sci- " ( all incidentally loanwords ) instead of appearing after initial " sz " , as though it were a single letter—in contrast to several languages such as albanian , in which " dh- " , " ë- " , " gj- " , " ll- " , " rr- " , " th- " , " xh- " and " zh- " ( all representing phonemes and considered separate single letters ) would follow the letters " d " , " e " , " g " , " l " , " n " , " r " , " t " , " x " and " z " respectively , as well as hungarian and welsh .
further , german words with umlaut are collated ignoring the umlaut—contrary to turkish that adopted the graphemes ö and ü , and where a word like " tüfek " , would come after " tuz " , in the dictionary .
an exception is the german telephone directory where umlauts are sorted like " ä " = " ae " since names such as " jäger " also appear with the spelling " jaeger " , and are not distinguished in the spoken language .
the danish and norwegian alphabets end with " æ"—"ø"—"å " , whereas the swedish and finnish ones conventionally put " å"—"ä"—"ö " at the end .
it is unknown whether the earliest alphabets had a defined sequence .
some alphabets today , such as the hanuno'o script , are learned one letter at a time , in no particular order , and are not used for collation where a definite order is required .
however , a dozen ugaritic tablets from the fourteenth century bc preserve the alphabet in two sequences .
one , the " abcde " order later used in phoenician , has continued with minor changes in hebrew , greek , armenian , gothic , cyrillic , and latin ; the other , " hmħlq , " was used in southern arabia and is preserved today in ethiopic .
both orders have therefore been stable for at least *num* years .
runic used an unrelated futhark sequence , which was later simplified .
arabic uses its own sequence , although arabic retains the traditional abjadi order for numbering .
the brahmic family of alphabets used in india use a unique order based on phonology : the letters are arranged according to how and where they are produced in the mouth .
this organization is used in southeast asia , tibet , korean hangul , and even japanese kana , which is not an alphabet .
the phoenician letter names , in which each letter was associated with a word that begins with that sound ( acrophony ) , continue to be used to varying degrees in samaritan , aramaic , syriac , hebrew , greek and arabic .
the names were abandoned in latin , which instead referred to the letters by adding a vowel ( usually e ) before or after the consonant ; the two exceptions were y and z , which were borrowed from the greek alphabet rather than etruscan , and were known as " y graeca " " greek y " ( pronounced " i graeca " " greek i " ) and " zeta " ( from greek ) —this discrepancy was inherited by many european languages , as in the term " zed " for z in all forms of english other than american english .
over time names sometimes shifted or were added , as in " double u " for w ( " double v " in french ) , the english name for y , and american " zee " for z .
comparing names in english and french gives a clear reflection of the great vowel shift : a , b , c and d are pronounced / eɪ , biː , siː , diː / in today's english , but in contemporary french they are / a , be , se , de / .
the french names ( from which the english names are derived ) preserve the qualities of the english vowels from before the great vowel shift .
by contrast , the names of f , l , m , n and s ( / ɛf , ɛl , ɛm , ɛn , ɛs / ) remain the same in both languages , because " short " vowels were largely unaffected by the shift .
in cyrillic originally the letters were given names based on slavic words ; this was later abandoned as well in favor of a system similar to that used in latin .
when an alphabet is adopted or developed to represent a given language , an orthography generally comes into being , providing rules for the spelling of words in that language .
in accordance with the principle on which alphabets are based , these rules will generally map letters of the alphabet to the phonemes ( significant sounds ) of the spoken language .
in a perfectly phonemic orthography there would be a consistent one-to-one correspondence between the letters and the phonemes , so that a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation , and a speaker would always know the pronunciation of a word given its spelling , and vice versa .
however this ideal is not usually achieved in practice ; some languages ( such as spanish and finnish ) come close to it , while others ( such as english ) deviate from it to a much larger degree .
the pronunciation of a language often evolves independently of its writing system , and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for , so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language .
languages may fail to achieve a one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways : national languages sometimes elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard .
some national languages like finnish , turkish , russian , serbo-croatian ( serbian , croatian and bosnian ) and bulgarian have a very regular spelling system with a nearly one-to-one correspondence between letters and phonemes .
strictly speaking , these national languages lack a word corresponding to the verb " to spell " ( meaning to split a word into its letters ) , the closest match being a verb meaning to split a word into its syllables .
similarly , the italian verb corresponding to ' spell ( out ) ' , " compitare " , is unknown to many italians because spelling is usually trivial , as italian spelling is highly phonemic .
in standard spanish , one can tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling , but not vice versa , as certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way , but a given letter is consistently pronounced .
french , with its silent letters and its heavy use of nasal vowels and elision , may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation , but its rules on pronunciation , though complex , are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy .
at the other extreme are languages such as english , where the pronunciations of many words simply have to be memorized as they do not correspond to the spelling in a consistent way .
for english , this is partly because the great vowel shift occurred after the orthography was established , and because english has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times , retaining their original spelling at varying levels .
even english has general , albeit complex , rules that predict pronunciation from spelling , and these rules are successful most of the time ; rules to predict spelling from the pronunciation have a higher failure rate .
sometimes , countries have the written language undergo a spelling reform to realign the writing with the contemporary spoken language .
these can range from simple spelling changes and word forms to switching the entire writing system itself , as when turkey switched from the arabic alphabet to a latin-based turkish alphabet .
the standard system of symbols used by linguists to represent sounds in any language , independently of orthography , is called the international phonetic alphabet .

cinema of italy the cinema of italy comprises the films made within italy or by italian directors .
the first italian director is considered to be vittorio calcina , a collaborator of the lumière brothers , who filmed pope leo xiii in *num* .
since its beginning , italian cinema has influenced film movements worldwide .
as of *num* , italian films have won *num* academy awards for best foreign language film ( the most of any country ) as well as *num* palmes d'or ( the second-most of any country ) , one academy award for best picture and many golden lions and golden bears .
italy is the birthplace of art cinema and the stylistic aspect of film has been the most important factor in the history of italian movies .
in the early 1900s , artistic and epic films such as the last days of pompeii ( *num* film ) , l'inferno ( *num* ) , quo vadis ( *num* ) , otello ( *num* film ) and cabiria ( *num* ) , were made as adaptations of books or stage plays .
italian filmmakers were utilizing complex set designs , lavish costumes , and record budgets , to produce pioneering films .
one of the first cinematic avante-garde movements , italian futurism , took place in italy in the late 1910s .
after a period of decline in the 1920s , the italian film industry was revitalized in the 1930s with the arrival of sound film .
a popular italian genre during this period , the " telefoni bianchi " , consisted of comedies with glamorous backgrounds .
while italy's fascist government provided financial support for the nation's film industry , most notably the construction of the cinecittà studios ( the largest film studio in europe ) , it also engaged in censorship , and thus many italian films produced in the late 1930s were propaganda films .
post-world war ii italy saw the rise of the influential italian neorealist movement , which launched the directorial careers of luchino visconti , roberto rossellini , and vittorio de sica .
neorealism declined in the late 1950s in favor of lighter films , such as those of the " commedia all'italiana " genre and important directors like federico fellini and michelangelo antonioni .
actresses such as sophia loren , giulietta masina and gina lollobrigida achieved international stardom during this period .
the spaghetti western achieved popularity in the mid-1960s , peaking with sergio leone's " dollars trilogy " , which featured enigmatic scores by composer ennio morricone .
erotic italian thrillers , or " giallos " , produced by directors such as mario bava and dario argento in the 1970s , influenced the horror genre worldwide .
during the 1980s and 1990s , directors such as ermanno olmi , bernardo bertolucci , giuseppe tornatore , gabriele salvatores and roberto benigni brought critical acclaim back to italian cinema .
the country is also famed for its prestigious venice film festival , the oldest film festival in the world , held annually since *num* and awarding the golden lion .
in *num* the venice days ( " giornate degli autori " ) , a section held in parallel to the venice film festival , has produced in collaboration with cinecittà studios and the ministry of cultural heritage a list of *num* films that have changed the collective memory of the country between *num* and *num* , the " *num* italian films to be saved " .
the french lumière brothers commenced public screenings in italy in *num* : in march *num* , in rome and milan ; in april in naples , salerno and bari ; in june in livorno ; in august in bergamo , bologna and ravenna ; in october in ancona ; and in december in turin , pescara and reggio calabria .
lumière trainees produced short films documenting everyday life and comic strips in the late 1890s and early 1900s .
pioneering italian cinematographer filoteo alberini patented his " kinetograph " during this period .
the italian film industry took shape between *num* and *num* , led by three major organizations : cines , based in rome ; and the turin-based companies ambrosio film and itala film .
other companies soon followed in milan and naples , and these early companies quickly attained a respectable production quality and were able to market their products both within italy and abroad .
early italian films typically consisted of adaptations of books or stage plays , such as mario caserini's " otello " ( *num* ) and arturo ambrosio's *num* adaptation of the novel , " the last days of pompeii " .
also popular during this period were films about historical figures , such as caserini's " beatrice cenci " ( *num* ) and ugo falena's " lucrezia borgia " ( *num* ) .
" l'inferno " , produced by milano films in *num* , was the first full-length italian feature film ever made .
popular early italian actors included emilio ghione , alberto collo , bartolomeo pagano , amleto novelli , lyda borelli , ida carloni talli , lidia quaranta and maria jacobini .
enrico guazzone's *num* film " quo vadis " was one of the earliest " blockbusters " in cinema history , utilizing thousands of extras and a lavish set design .
giovanni pastrone's *num* film " cabiria " was an even larger production , requiring two years and a record budget to produce , and it was the first epic film ever made .
nino martoglio's " lost in darkness " , also produced in *num* , documented life in the slums of naples , and is considered a precursor to the neorealist movement of the 1940s and 1950s .
between *num* and *num* , italy was home to the first avant-garde movement in cinema , inspired by the country's futurism movement .
the *num* manifesto of futuristic cinematography was signed by filippo marinetti , armando ginna , bruno corra , giacomo balla and others .
to the futurists , cinema was an ideal art form , being a fresh medium , and able to be manipulated by speed , special effects and editing .
most of the futuristic-themed films of this period have been lost , but critics cite " thaïs " ( *num* ) by anton giulio bragaglia as one of the most influential , serving as the main inspiration for german expressionist cinema in the following decade .
the italian film industry struggled against rising foreign competition in the years following world war i .
several major studios , among them cines and ambrosio , formed the unione cinematografica italiana to coordinate a national strategy for film production .
this effort was largely unsuccessful , however , due to a wide disconnect between production and exhibition ( some movies weren't released until several years after they were produced ) .
among the notable italian films of the late silent era were mario camerini's " rotaio " ( *num* ) and alessandro blasetti's " sun " ( *num* ) .
in *num* , gennaro righelli directed the first italian talking picture , " the song of love " .
this was followed by blasetti's " mother earth " ( *num* ) and " resurrection " ( *num* ) , and camerini's " figaro and his great day " ( *num* ) .
the advent of talkies led to stricter censorship by the fascist government .
during the 1930s , light comedies known as " telefoni bianchi " ( " white telephones " ) were predominant in italian cinema .
these films , which featured lavish set designs , promoted conservative values and respect for authority , and thus typically avoided the scrutiny of government censors .
important examples of " telefoni bianchi " include guido brignone's " paradiso " ( *num* ) , carlo bragaglia's " o la borsa o la vita " ( *num* ) , and righelli's " together in the dark " ( *num* ) .
historical films such as blasetti's " *num* " ( *num* ) and carmine gallone's " " ( *num* ) were also popular during this period .
in *num* , the italian government created the general directorate for cinema ( " direzione generale per le cinematografia " ) , and appointed luigi freddi its director .
with the approval of benito mussolini , this directorate called for the establishment of a town southeast of rome devoted exclusively to cinema , dubbed the " cinecittà " ( " cinema city " ) .
completed in *num* , the cinecittà provided everything necessary for filmmaking : theaters , technical services , and even a cinematography school , the centro sperimentale di cinematografia , for younger apprentices .
the cinecittà studios were europe's most advanced production facilities , and greatly boosted the technical quality of italian films .
many films are still shot entirely in cinecittà .
during this period , mussolini's son , vittorio , created a national production company and organized the work of noted authors , directors and actors ( including even some political opponents ) , thereby creating an interesting communication network among them , which produced several noted friendships and stimulated cultural interaction .
by the end of world war ii , the italian " neorealist " movement had begun to take shape .
neorealist films typically dealt with the working class ( in contrast to the " telefoni bianchi " ) , and were shot on location .
many neorealist films , but not all , utilized non-professional actors .
though the term " neorealism " was used for the first time to describe luchino visconti’s *num* film , " ossessione " , there were several important precursors to the movement , most notably camerini's " what scoundrels men are ! " ( *num* ) , which was the first italian film shot entirely on location , and blasetti's *num* film , " four steps in the clouds " .
"ossessione " angered fascist officials .
upon viewing the film , vittorio mussolini is reported to have shouted , " this is not italy ! " before walking out of the theater .
the film was subsequently banned in the fascist-controlled parts of italy .
while neorealism exploded after the war , and was incredibly influential at the international level , neorealist films made up only a small percentage of italian films produced during this period , as postwar italian moviegoers preferred escapist comedies starring actors such as totò and alberto sordi .
neorealist works such as roberto rossellini's trilogy " rome , open city " ( *num* ) , " paisà " ( *num* ) , and " germany , year zero " ( *num* ) , with professional actors such as anna magnani and a number of non-professional actors , attempted to describe the difficult economic and moral conditions of postwar italy and the changes in public mentality in everyday life .
visconti's " the earth trembles " ( *num* ) was shot on location in a sicilian fishing village , and utilized local non-professional actors .
giuseppe de santis , on other hand , used actors such as silvana mangano and vittorio gassman in his *num* film , " bitter rice " , which is set in the po valley during rice-harvesting season .
poetry and cruelty of life were harmonically combined in the works that vittorio de sica wrote and directed together with screenwriter cesare zavattini : among them , " shoeshine " ( *num* ) , " the bicycle thief " ( *num* ) and " miracle in milan " ( *num* ) .
the *num* film " umberto d .
" showed a poor old man with his little dog , who must beg for alms against his dignity in the loneliness of the new society .
this work is perhaps de sica's masterpiece and one of the most important works in italian cinema .
it was not a commercial success and since then it has been shown on italian television only a few times .
yet it is perhaps the most violent attack , in the apparent quietness of the action , against the rules of the new economy , the new mentality , the new values , and it embodies both a conservative and a progressive view .
although " umberto d .
" is considered the end of the neorealist period , later films such as federico fellini's " la strada " ( *num* ) and de sica's *num* film " two women " ( for which sophia loren won the oscar for best actress ) are grouped with the genre .
director pier paolo pasolini's first film , " accattone " ( *num* ) , shows a strong neorealist influence .
italian neorealist cinema influenced filmmakers around the world , and helped inspire other film movements , such as the french new wave and the polish film school .
the neorealist period is often simply referred to as " the golden age " of italian cinema by critics , filmmakers , and scholars .
it has been said that after " umberto d .
" nothing more could be added to neorealism .
possibly because of this , neorealism effectively ended with that film ; subsequent works turned toward lighter atmospheres , perhaps more coherent with the improving conditions of the country , and this genre has been called " pink neorealism " .
this trend allowed better-"equipped " actresses to become real celebrities , such as sophia loren , gina lollobrigida , silvana pampanini , lucia bosé , barbara bouchet , eleonora rossi drago , silvana mangano , virna lisi , claudia cardinale and stefania sandrelli .
soon pink neorealism , such as " pane , amore e gelosia " ( *num* , released in the us as " frisky " ) with vittorio desica and gina lollobrigida , was replaced by the " commedia all'italiana " , a unique genre that , born on an ideally humouristic line , talked instead very seriously about important social themes .
at this time , on the more commercial side of production , the phenomenon of totò , a neapolitan actor who is acclaimed as the major italian comic , exploded .
his films ( often with peppino de filippo and almost always with mario castellani ) expressed a sort of neorealistic satire , in the means of a " guitto " ( a " hammy " actor ) as well as with the art of the great dramatic actor he also was .
a " film-machine " who produced dozens of titles per year , his repertoire was frequently repeated .
his personal story ( a prince born in the poorest " rione " ( section of the city ) of naples ) , his unique twisted face , his special mimic expressions and his gestures created an inimitable personage and made him one of the most beloved italians of the 1960s .
italian comedy is generally considered to have started with mario monicelli's " i soliti ignoti " ( " big deal on madonna street " , *num* ) and derives its name from the title of pietro germi's " divorzio all'italiana " ( " divorce italian style " , *num* ) .
for a long time this definition was used with a derogatory intention .
vittorio gassman , marcello mastroianni , ugo tognazzi , alberto sordi , claudia cardinale , monica vitti and nino manfredi were among the stars of these movies , that described the years of the economical reprise and investigated italian customs , a sort of self-ethnological research .
in *num* dino risi directed " una vita difficile " ( " a difficult life " ) , then " il sorpasso " ( the easy life ) , now a cult-movie , followed by : " i mostri " ( " the monsters " , also known as " *num* from rome " ) , " in nome del popolo italiano " ( " in the name of the italian people " ) and " profumo di donna " ( " scent of a woman " ) .
monicelli's works include " la grande guerra " ( " the great war " ) , " i compagni " ( " comrades " , also known as " the organizer " ) , " l'armata brancaleone " , " vogliamo i colonnelli " ( " we want the colonels " ) , " romanzo popolare " ( popular novel ) and the " amici miei " series .
a series of black-and-white films based on don camillo character created by the italian writer and journalist giovannino guareschi were made between *num* and *num* .
these were french-italian coproductions , and starred fernandel as don camillo and gino cervi as peppone .
the titles are : " the little world of don camillo " , " the return of don camillo " , " don camillo's last round " , " " , and " don camillo in moscow " .
mario camerini began filming the film " don camillo e i giovani d'oggi " but had to stop filming due to fernandel's falling ill , which resulted in his untimely death .
the film was then completed in *num* with gastone moschin playing the role of don camillo and lionel stander as peppone .
a don camillo ( " the world of don camillo " ) film was remade in *num* , an italian production with terence hill directing and also starring as don camillo .
colin blakely performed peppone in one of his last film roles .
in the late 1940s , hollywood studios began to shift production abroad to europe .
italy was , along with britain , one of the major destinations for american film companies .
shooting at cinecittà , large-budget films such as " quo vadis " ( *num* ) , " roman holiday " ( *num* ) , " ben-hur " ( *num* ) , and " cleopatra " ( *num* ) were made in english with international casts and sometimes , but not always , italian settings or themes .
the heyday of what was dubbed ' " hollywood on the tiber " was between *num* and *num* , during which time many of the most famous names in world cinema made films in italy .
with the release of 1958's " hercules " , starring american bodybuilder steve reeves , the italian film industry gained entree to the american film market .
these films , many with mythological or bible themes , were low-budget costume / adventure dramas , and had immediate appeal with both european and american audiences .
besides the many films starring a variety of muscle men as hercules , heroes such as samson and italian fictional hero maciste were common .
sometimes dismissed as low-quality escapist fare , the peplums allowed newer directors such as sergio leone and mario bava a means of breaking into the film industry .
some , such as mario bava's " hercules in the haunted world " ( italian : ercole al centro della terra ) are considered seminal works in their own right .
as the genre matured , budgets sometimes increased , as evidenced in 1962's " i sette gladiatori " ( " the seven gladiators " in *num* us release ) , a wide-screen epic with impressive sets and matte-painting work .
most peplum films were in color , whereas previous italian efforts had often been black and white .
on the heels of the peplum craze , a related genre , the spaghetti western arose and was popular both in italy and elsewhere .
these films differed from traditional westerns by being filmed in europe on limited budgets , but featured vivid cinematography .
the most popular spaghetti westerns were those of sergio leone , whose dollars trilogy ( " a fistful of dollars " , " for a few dollars more " , and " the good , the bad and the ugly " ) , featuring clint eastwood and scores by ennio morricone , came to define the genre along with " once upon a time in the west " .
also considered spaghetti westerns is a film genre which combined traditional western ambiance with a commedia all'italiana-type comedy ; films including " they call me trinity " and " trinity is still my name ! " , which featured bud spencer and terence hill , the stage names of carlo pedersoli and mario girotti .
italy has produced many important cinematography " auteurs " , including federico fellini , michelangelo antonioni , roberto rossellini , vittorio de sica , luchino visconti , ettore scola , sergio leone , luigi comencini , pier paolo pasolini , bernardo bertolucci , franco zeffirelli , ermanno olmi , valerio zurlini , florestano vancini , mario monicelli , marco ferreri , elio petri , dino risi and mauro bolognini .
these directors ' works often span many decades and genres .
present " auteurs " include giuseppe tornatore , marco bellocchio , nanni moretti , gabriele salvatores , gianni amelio , dario argento and paolo sorrentino .
in *num* sophia loren won the academy award for best actress for her role as a woman who is raped in world war ii , along with her adolescent daughter , in vittorio de sica's " two women " .
she was the first actress to win an academy award for a performance in any foreign language , and the second italian leading lady oscar-winner ( after anna magnani ) .
during the 1960s and 70s , italian filmmakers mario bava , riccardo freda , antonio margheriti and dario argento developed " giallo " horror films that become classics and influenced the genre in other countries .
representative films include : " black sunday " , " castle of blood " , " twitch of the death nerve " , " the bird with the crystal plumage " , " deep red " and " suspiria .
" due to the success of the james bond film series the italian film industry made large amounts of imitations and spoofs in the eurospy genre from 1964-1967 .
following the 1960s boom of shockumentary " mondo films " such as gualtiero jacopetti's " mondo cane " , during the late 1970s and early 1980s , italian cinema became internationally synonymous with violent horror films .
these films were primarily produced for the video market and were credited with fueling the " video nasty " era in the united kingdom .
directors in this genre included lucio fulci , joe d'amato , umberto lenzi and ruggero deodato .
some of their films faced legal challenges in the united kingdom ; after the video recordings act of *num* , it became a legal offense to sell a copy of such films as " cannibal holocaust " and " ss experiment camp " .
italian films of this period are usually grouped together as exploitation films .
several countries charged italian studios with exceeding the boundaries of acceptability with their late-1970s nazi exploitation films , inspired by american movies such as " ilsa , she wolf of the ss " .
the italian works included the notorious but comparatively tame " ss experiment camp " and the far more graphic " last orgy of the third reich " ( italian : l'ultima orgia del iii reich ) .
these films showed , in great detail , sexual crimes against prisoners at concentration camps .
these films may still be banned in the united kingdom and other countries .
poliziotteschi ( ; plural of poliziottesco ) films constitute a subgenre of crime and action film that emerged in italy in the late 1960s and reached the height of their popularity in the 1970s .
they are also known as polizieschi , italo-crime , euro-crime or simply italian crime films .
most notable international actors acted in this genre of films such alain delon , henry silva , fred williamson , charles bronson , tomas milian and others international stars .
between the late 1970s and mid 1980s , italian cinema was in crisis ; " art films " became increasingly isolated , separating from the mainstream italian cinema .
among the major artistic films of this era were " la città delle donne " , " e la nave va " , " ginger and fred " by fellini , " l'albero degli zoccoli " by ermanno olmi ( winner of the palme d'or at the cannes film festival ) , " la notte di san lorenzo " by paolo and vittorio taviani , antonioni's " identificazione di una donna " , and " bianca " and " la messa è finita " by nanni moretti .
although not entirely italian , bertolucci's " the last emperor " , winner of *num* oscars , and " once upon a time in america " of sergio leone came out of this period also .
during this time , commedia sexy all'italiana films , described as " trash films " , were popular in italy .
these comedy films were of little artistic value and reached their popularity by confronting italian social taboos , most notably in the sexual sphere .
actors such as lino banfi , diego abatantuono , alvaro vitali , gloria guida , barbara bouchet and edwige fenech owe much of their popularity to these films .
also considered part of the trash genre are films which feature fantozzi , a comic personage invented by paolo villaggio .
although villaggio's movies tend to bridge trash comedy with a more elevated social satire ; this character had a great impact on italian society , to such a degree that the adjective " fantozziano " entered the lexicon .
of the many films telling of fantozzi's misadventures , the most notable were " fantozzi " and " il secondo tragico fantozzi " .
a new generation of directors has helped return italian cinema to a healthy level since the end of the 1980s .
probably the most noted film of the period is " nuovo cinema paradiso " , for which giuseppe tornatore won a *num* oscar ( awarded in *num* ) for best foreign language film .
this award was followed when gabriele salvatores's " mediterraneo " won the same prize for *num* .
" " ( *num* ) , directed by and starring massimo troisi , received five nominations at the academy awards , and won for best original score .
another exploit was in *num* when roberto benigni won three oscars for his movie " life is beautiful " ( " la vita è bella ) " ( best actor , best foreign film , best music ) .
in *num* nanni moretti's film " the son's room " ( " la stanza del figlio " ) received the palme d'or at the cannes film festival .
other noteworthy recent italian films include : " jona che visse nella balena " directed by roberto faenza , " il grande cocomero " by francesca archibugi , " the profession of arms " ( " il mestiere delle armi " ) by olmi , " l'ora di religione " by marco bellocchio , " il ladro di bambini " , " lamerica " , " the keys to the house " ( " le chiavi di casa " ) by gianni amelio , " i'm not scared " ( " io non ho paura " ) by gabriele salvatores , " le fate ignoranti " , " facing windows " ( " la finestra di fronte " ) by ferzan özpetek , " good morning , night " ( " buongiorno , notte " ) by marco bellocchio , " the best of youth " ( " la meglio gioventù " ) by marco tullio giordana , " the beast in the heart " ( " la bestia nel cuore " ) by cristina comencini .
in *num* paolo sorrentino's " il divo " , a biographical film based on the life of giulio andreotti , won the jury prize and " gomorra " , a crime drama film , directed by matteo garrone won the gran prix at the cannes film festival .
paolo sorrentino's " the great beauty " ( " la grande bellezza " ) won the *num* academy award for best foreign language film .
the two highest-grossing italian films have both been directed by gennaro nunziante and starred checco zalone : " sole a catinelle " ( *num* ) with €51 .
*num* million , and " quo vado ? " ( *num* ) with €65 .
*num* million .
"they call me jeeg " , a *num* critically acclaimed superhero film directed by gabriele mainetti and starring claudio santamaria , won many awards , such as eight david di donatello , two nastro d'argento , and a globo d'oro .
gianfranco rosi's documentary film " fire at sea " ( *num* ) won the golden bear at the *ord* berlin international film festival .
" they call me jeeg " and " fire at sea " were also selected as the italian entry for the best foreign language film at the *ord* academy awards , but they were not nominated .
other successful 2010s italian films include : " vincere " by marco bellocchio , " the first beautiful thing " ( " la prima cosa bella " ) , " human capital " ( " il capitale umano " ) and " like crazy " ( " la pazza gioia " ) by paolo virzì , " we have a pope " ( " habemus papam " ) and " mia madre " by nanni moretti , " caesar must die " ( " cesare deve morire " ) by paolo and vittorio taviani , " don't be bad " ( " non essere cattivo " ) by claudio caligari , " romanzo criminale " by michele placido ( that spawned a tv series , " romanzo criminale - la serie " ) , " youth " ( " la giovinezza " ) by paolo sorrentino , " suburra " by stefano sollima , " perfect strangers " ( " perfetti sconosciuti " ) by paolo genovese , " italian race " ( " veloce come il vento " ) by matteo rovere , and " mediterranea " and " a ciambra " by jonas carpignano .
"call me by your name " ( *num* ) , the final installment in luca guadagnino's thematic " desire " trilogy , following " i am love " ( *num* ) and " a bigger splash " ( *num* ) , received widespread acclaim and numerous accolades , including the academy award for best adapted screenplay in *num* .
bastarnae the bastarnae ( latin variants : " bastarni " , or " basternae " ; ) were an ancient people who between *num* bc and *num* ad inhabited the region between the carpathian mountains and the river dnieper , to the north and east of ancient dacia .
the peucini , denoted a branch of the bastarnae by greco-roman writers , occupied the region north of the danube delta .
the ethno-linguistic affiliation of the bastarnae was probably celtic , which is supported by earliest historians .
however , later historian sources imply a germanic or scytho-sarmatian origins .
often they are associated with the germans , or the peoples " between the celts and the germans " .
the most likely scenario is that they were originally a celtic tribe , originally resident in the lower vistula river valley .
in ca .
*num* bc , these tribes then migrated , possibly accompanied by some germanic elements , southeastwards into the north pontic region .
some elements appear to have become assimilated , to some extent , by the surrounding sarmatians by the *ord* century .
although largely sedentary , some elements may have adopted a semi-nomadic lifestyle .
it has not , so far , been possible to identify archaeological sites which can be conclusively attributed to the bastarnae .
the archaeological horizons most often associated by scholars with the bastarnae are the zarubintsy and poienesti-lukashevka cultures .
the bastarnae first came into conflict with the romans during the *ord* century bc , when , in alliance with dacians and sarmatians , they unsuccessfully resisted roman expansion into moesia and pannonia .
later , they appear to have maintained friendly relations with the roman empire during the first two centuries ad .
this changed from c .
*num* , when the bastarnae are recorded as participants in an invasion of roman territory , once again in alliance with sarmatian and dacian elements .
in the *ord* century , the bastarnae were part of a gothic-led grand coalition of lower danube tribes that repeatedly invaded the balkan provinces of the roman empire .
large numbers of bastarnae were resettled within the roman empire in the late *ord* century .
according to polybius ( *num* – *num* bc ) : ""a mission from the dardanians now arrived , telling of the bastarnae , their numbers , the huge size and the valour of their warriors , and also pointing out that perseus and the galatians were in league with this tribe .
they said they were much more afraid of him than of the bastarnae , and they begged for aid .
" " according to livy ( *num* bc – *num* ad ) : ""the way to the hadriatic and to italy lay through the scordisci ; that was the only practicable route for an army , and the scordisci were expected to grant a passage to the bastarnae without any difficulty , for neither in speech nor habits were they dissimilar , and it was hoped that they would unite forces with them when they saw that they were going to secure the plunder of a very wealthy nation .
" " according to strabo ( *num* bc – *num* ad ) : ""however , it is clear from the " climata " and the parallel distances that if one travels longitudinally towards the east , one encounters the regions that are about the borysthenes and that are to the north of the pontus ; but what is beyond germany and what beyond the countries which are next after germany — whether one should say the bastarnae , as most writers suspect , or say that others lie in between , either the iazyges , or the roxolani , or certain other of the wagon-dwellers — it is not easy to say ; nor yet whether they extend as far as the ocean along its entire length , or whether any part is uninhabitable by reason of the cold or other cause , or whether even a different race of people , succeeding the germans , is situated between the sea and the eastern germans .
and this same ignorance prevails also in regard to the rest of the peoples that come next in order on the north ; for i know neither the bastarnae , nor the sauromatae , nor , in a word , any of the peoples who dwell above the pontus , nor how far distant they are from the atlantic sea , nor whether their countries border upon it .
" " accroding to plutarch ( ad *num* – *num* ad ) : ""he also secretly stirred up the gauls settled along the danube , who are called basternae , an equestrian host and warlike ; and he invited the illyrians , through genthius their king , to take part with him in the war .
and a report prevailed that the barbarians had been hired by him to pass through lower gaul , along the coast of the adriatic , and make an incursion into italy .
" """ according to tacitus ( *num* – *num* ad ) : ""as to the tribes of the peucini , veneti , and fenni i am in doubt whether i should class them with the germans or the sarmatæ , although indeed the peucini called by some bastarnæ , are like germans in their language , mode of life , and in the permanence of their settlements .
they all live in filth and sloth , and by the intermarriages of the chiefs they are becoming in some degree debased into a resemblance to the sarmatæ .
" " according to cassius dio ( *num* – *num* ad ) : ""during the same period in which these events occurred marcus crassus was sent into macedonia and greece and carried on war with the dacians and bastarnae .
i have already stated who the former were and why they had become hostile ; the bastarnae , on the other hand , who are properly classed as scythians , had at this time crossed the ister and subdued the part of moesia opposite them , and afterwards subdued the triballi who adjoin this district and the dardani who inhabit the triballian country .
" " according to zosismus ( 490s – *num* ad ) : ""he likewise left in thrace the bastarnae , a scythian people , who submitted to him , giving them land to inhabit there ; on which account they observed the roman laws and customs .
" " the origin of the tribal name is uncertain .
it is not even clear whether it was an exonym ( a name ascribed to them by outsiders ) or an endonym ( a name by which the bastarnae described themselves ) .
a related question is whether the groups denoted " bastarnae " by the romans considered themselves a distinct ethnic group at all ( endonym ) or whether it was a generic exonym used by the greco-romans to denote a disparate group of tribes of the carpathian region that could not be classified as dacians or sarmatians .
one possible derivation is from the proto-germanic word " *bastjan " ( from proto-indo-european root *"bʰas- " ) means " binding " or " tie " .
in this case , " bastarnae " may have had the original meaning of a coalition or " bund " of tribes .
it is possible that the roman term " basterna " , denoting a type of wagon or litter , is derived from the name of this people ( or , if it is an exonym , the name of the people is derived from it ) which was known , like many germanic tribes , to travel with a wagon-train for their families .
it has also been suggested that the name is linked with the germanic word " bastard " , meaning illegitimate or mongrel .
but batty considers this derivation unlikely .
if the name is an endonym , then this derivation is unlikely , as most endonyms have flattering meanings ( e .
g .
" brave " , " strong " , " noble " ) .
trubačev proposes a derivation from old persian , avestan " bast- " " bound , tied ; slave " ( cf .
ossetic bættən " bind " , bast " bound " ) and iranian " *arna- " " offspring " , equating it with the " δουλόσποροι " " slave sporoi " mentioned by nonnus and cosmas , where sporoi is the people procopius mentions as the ancestors of the slavs .
the original homeland of the bastarnae remains uncertain .
babeş and shchukin argue in favour of an origin in eastern pomerania on the baltic coast of nw poland , on the grounds of correspondences in archaeological material e .
g .
a pomeranian-style fibula found in a poieneşti site in moldavia ( although batty considers the evidence insufficient ) .
babeş identifies the sidoni , a branch of the bastarnae which strabo places north of the danube delta with the " sidini " located by ptolemy in pomerania .
batty argues that greco-roman sources of the *ord* century ad locate the bastarnae homeland on the northern side of the northern carpathian mountain range , encompassing s .
e .
poland and sw ukraine ( i .
e .
the region traditionally known as galicia ) .
pliny locates the bastarnae between the suebi and the dacians ( " contermini dacis " ) .
the peutinger map ( produced in ca .
*num* ad , but including material from as early as the *ord* century ) shows the bastarnae ( mis-spelt " blastarni " ) north of the carpathian mountains and appears to name the galician carpathians as the " alpes bastarnicae " .
from galicia , the bastarnae expanded into modern-day moldavia and bessarabia , reaching the danube delta .
strabo describes the bastarnae as inhabiting the territory " between the " ister " ( river danube ) and the " borysthenes " ( river dnieper ) " .
he identifies three sub-tribes of the bastarnae : the atmoni , sidoni and peucini .
the latter derived their name from peuce , a large island in the danube delta , which they had colonised .
the 2nd-century geographer ptolemy states that the " carpiani " or carpi ( believed to have occupied moldavia ) separated the peucini from the other bastarnae " above dacia " ( i .
e .
north of dacia ) .
it thus appears that the bastarnae were settled in a vast arc stretching around the northern and eastern flanks of the carpathians from se poland to the danube delta .
the larger group inhabited the northern and eastern slopes of the carpathians and the region between the prut and dnieper rivers ( moldova republic / western ukraine ) , while a separate group ( the peucini , sidoni and atmoni ) dwelt in and north of the danube delta region .
scholars hold divergent theories about the ethnicity of the bastarnae .
the view , following what appears to be the most authoritative view among earliest scholars , is that they spoke celtic .
however others hold that they were scythian / germanic , or mixed germanic / sarmatian .
a fringe theory is that they were proto-slavic .
shchukin argues that ethnicity of the bastarnae was unique and rather than trying to label the bastanae as celtic , germanic or sarmatian , it should be accepted that the " basternae were the basternae " .
batty argues that assigning an " ethnicity " to the bastarnae is meaningless , as in the context of the iron age pontic-danubian region , with its multiple overlapping peoples and languages , ethnicity was a very fluid concept : it could and did change rapidly and frequently , according to socio-political vicissitudes .
this was especially true of the bastarnae , who are attested over a relatively vast area .
a leading reason to consider the bastarnae as celtic is that the regions they are documented to have occupied ( northern and eastern slopes of the carpathians ) overlapped to a great extent with the locations of celtic tribes attested in the northern carpathians .
indeed , a large part of this region , galicia , may derive its name from its former celtic inhabitants the taurisci , osi , cotini and anartes of slovakia and northern romania and the britogalli of the danubian mouth region .
in addition , archaeological cultures , which some scholars have linked to the bastarnae ( poieneşti-lukashevka asnd zarubintsy ) , display pronounced celtic affinities .
finally , the arrival of the bastarnae in the pontic-danubian region , which can be dated to 233-216 bc according to two ancient sources , coincides with the latter phase of celtic migration into the region ( 400-200 bc ) .
the earliest historians give a celtic or gallic origin to the bastarnae .
roman historian livy , writing in c .
ad *num* , attest that the bastarnae spoke celtic .
relating the bastarnic invasion of the balkans of *num* bc ( see conflict with rome below ) , he describes them then as " "they were not very different in either language or manners" " to the celtic tribe of the scordisci , a tribe of pannonia .
the scordisci are described as celtic by strabo ( although he adds that they had mingled with illyrians and thracians ) .
the greeks historian plutarch infrom us that the roman consul hostilius " "secretly stirred up the gauls settled along the danube , who are called basternae " .
" however , a celtic identity for the bastarnae is apparently contradicted by polybius ( writing ca .
*num* bc ) , who was an actual contemporary of the events described , unlike livy , who was writing some *num* years later .
polybius clearly distinguishes the bastarnae from the " galatae " ( i .
e .
celts ) : " an embassy from the dardani arrived [ at the roman senate ] , talking of the bastarnae , their huge numbers , the strength and valour of their warriors , and also reporting that perseus [ king of macedon ] and the galatae were in league with this tribe " .
in addition , inscription ae ( *num* ) *num* , recording a campaign on the hungarian plain by the augustan-era general marcus vinucius ( *num* bc or *num* bc ) , also appears to distinguish the bastarnae from neighbouring celtic tribes : " marcus vinucius .

" the names of three bastarnae leaders are preserved in the ancient sources are of celtic origin : cotto , clondicus , and teutagonus greco-roman geographers of the *ord* century ad are unanimous and specific that the bastarnae were germanic in language and culture .
the greek geographer strabo ( writing c .
ad 5-20 ) says the bastarnae are " of germanic stock " .
the roman geographer pliny the elder ( c .
ad *num* ) , classifies the bastarnae and peucini as constituting one of the *num* main subdivisions of germanic peoples ( he lists the other subdivisions as the " inguaeones " , " istuaeones " and " hermiones " ( west germanic tribes ) , and the " vandili " ( vandals , east germanic , but he classifies differently than the bastarnae ) .
the roman historian tacitus ( c .
ad *num* ) describes the bastaenae as germans with substantial sarmatian influence , but moves on to state : " the peucini , however , who are sometimes called bastarnae , are like the germans in their language , way of life and types of dwelling .
" strabo includes the roxolani , generally considered by scholars to have been a sarmatian tribe , in a list of bastarnae subgroups .
however , this may simply be an error due to the close proximity of the two peoples north of the danube delta .
in the *ord* century , the greek historian dio cassius states that the " bastarnae are properly classed as scythians " and " members of the scythian race " .
likewise , the 6th-century historian zosimus , reporting events around ad *num* , refers to " the bastarnae , a scythian people " .
however , it appears that these late greco-roman chroniclers used the term " scythian " more often in a geographical sense ( i .
e .
inhabitants of the region they called scythia i .
e .
the pontic region north of the danube ) rather than in an ethnic one ( i .
e .
members of the scythian people , steppe nomads of iranic origin , related to the sarmatians , who had supplanted the scythians ' dominance of the steppes in the period bc ) .
for example , zosimus also routinely refers to the goths , who were undoubtedly germanic-speakers , as " scythians " .
it is possible that some bastarnae may have been assimilated by the surrounding ( and possibly dominant ) sarmatians , perhaps adopting their tongue ( which belonged to the iranian group of indo-european languages ) and / or sarmatian customs .
thus tacitus ' comment that " mixed marriages are giving [ the bastarnae ] to some extent the vile appearance of the sarmatians " .
on the other hand , the bastarnae maintained a separate name-identity until ca .
ad *num* , probably implying retention of their distinctive ethno-linguistic heritage until that time .
it seems , on balance , likely that the core population of bastarnae had always been , and continued to be , germanic in language and culture .
according to todd , traditional archaeology has not been able to construct a typology of bastarnae material culture , and thus to ascribe particular archaeological sites to the bastarnae .
a complicating factor is that the regions where bastarnae are attested contained a patchwork of peoples and cultures ( sarmatians , scythians , dacians , thracians , celts , germans and others ) , some sedentary , some nomadic .
in any event , post-1960s archaeological theory questions the validity of equating material " cultures " , as defined by archaeologists , with distinct ethnic groups .
on this view , it is impossible to attribute a " culture " to a particular ethnic group : it is likely that the material cultures discerned in the region belonged to several , if not all , of the groups inhabiting it .
these cultures probably represent relatively large-scale socio-economic interactions between disparate communities of the broad region , possibly including mutually antagonistic groups .
it is not even certain whether the bastarnae were sedentary or nomadic ( or semi-nomadic ) .
tacitus ' statement that they were " german in their way of life and types of dwelling " implies a sedentary bias , but their close relations with the sarmatians , who were nomadic , may indicate a more nomadic lifestyle for some bastarnae , as does the wide geographical range of their attested inhabitation .
if the bastarnae were nomadic , then the sedentary " cultures " identified by archaeologists in their " lebensraum " would not represent them .
nomadic peoples generally leave scant traces , due to the impermanent materials and foundations used in the construction of their dwellings .
scholars have identified two closely related sedentary " cultures " as possible candidates to represent the bastarnae ( among other peoples ) as their locations broadly correspond to where ancient sources placed the basternae : the zarubintsy culture lying in the forest-steppe zone in northern ukraine-southern belarus , and the poieneşti-lukashevka ( lucăşeuca ) culture in northern moldavia .
these cultures were characterised by agriculture , documented by numerous finds of sickles .
dwellings were either of surface or semi-subterranean types , with posts supporting the walls , a hearth in the middle , and large conical pits located nearby .
some sites were defended by ditches and banks , structures thought to have been built to defend against nomadic tribes from the steppe .
inhabitants practiced cremation .
cremated remains were either placed in large , hand-made ceramic urns , or were placed in a large pit and surrounded by food and ornaments such as spiral bracelets and middle to late la tène-type " fibulae " ( attesting the continuing strength of celtic influence in this region ) .
a major problem with associating lukashevka and zarubintsy with the bastarnae is that both cultures had disappeared by the early *ord* century ad , although the bastarnae continue to be attested in those regions throughout the roman principate .
another issue is that the poieneşti-lukashevka culture has also been attributed to the costoboci , a people considered ethnic-dacian by mainstream scholarship , which inhabited northern moldavia , according to ptolemy ( ca .
ad *num* ) .
indeed , mircea babeş and silvia theodor , the two romanian archaeologists who identified lukashevka as bastarnic , nevertheless insisted that the majority of the population in the lukashevka sphere ( n .
moldavia ) was " geto-dacian " .
a further problem is that neither of these cultures were present in the danube delta region , where a major concentration of bastarnae are attested by the ancient sources .
starting in about ad *num* , the chernyakhov culture became established in the w .
ukraine / moldova region inhabited by the bastarnae .
the culture is characterised by a high degree of sophistication in the production of metal and ceramic artefacts , as well as of uniformity over a vast area .
although this culture has conventionally been identified with the migration of the gothic " ethnos " into the region from the northwest , todd argues that its most important origin is scytho-sarmatian .
although the goths certainly contributed to it , so probably did other peoples of the region such as the dacians , proto-slavs , carpi , and possibly the bastarnae .
the bastarnae first appear in the historical record in *num* bc , when they crossed the danube in massive force .
they did so at the invitation of their long-time ally , king philip v of macedon , a direct descendant of antigonus , one of the diadochi , the generals of alexander the great who had shared out his empire after his death in *num* bc .
the macedonian king had suffered a disastrous defeat at the hands of the romans in the second macedonian war ( 200-197 bc ) , which had reduced him from a powerful hellenistic monarch to the status of a petty client-king with a much-reduced territory and a tiny army .
after nearly *num* years of slavish adherence to the roman senate's dictats , philip had been goaded beyond endurance by the incessant and devastating raiding of the dardani , a warlike thraco-illyrian tribe on his northern border , which his treaty-limited army was too small to counter effectively .
counting on the bastarnae , with whom he had forged friendly relations in earlier times , he plotted a strategy to deal with the dardani and then to regain his lost territories in greece and his political independence .
first , he would unleash the bastarnae against the dardani .
after the latter had been crushed , philip planned to settle bastarnae families in dardania ( southern kosovo / skopje region ) , to ensure that the region was permanently subdued .
in a second phase , philip aimed to launch the bastarnae on an invasion of italy via the adriatic coast .
although he was aware that the bastarnae were hardly likely to achieve the same success as hannibal some *num* years earlier , and would most likely end up cut to pieces by the romans , philip hoped that the romans would be distracted long enough to allow him to reoccupy his former possessions in greece .
but philip , now *num* years of age , died before the bastarnae could arrive .
the bastarnae host was still " en route " through thrace , where it became embroiled in hostilities with the locals , who were unable ( or unwilling ) to provide them with sufficient food at affordable prices as they marched through .
probably in the vicinity of philippopolis ( modern plovdiv , bulgaria ) , the bastarnae broke out of their marching columns and pillaged the land far and wide .
the terrified local thracians took refuge with their families and animal herds on the slopes of " mons donuca " , the highest mountain in thrace ( mt .
, bulgaria ) .
a large force of bastarnae chased them up the mountain , but were driven back and scattered by a massive hailstorm .
then the thracians ambushed them , turning their descent into a panic-stricken rout .
back at their wagon-laager in the plain , around half the demoralised bastarnae decided to return home , leaving c .
*num* , *num* to press on to macedonia .
philip's son and successor perseus , while protesting his loyalty to rome , deployed his bastarnae guests in winter quarters in a valley in dardania , presumably as a prelude to a campaign against the dardani the following summer .
but in the depths of winter their camp was attacked by the dardani .
the bastarnae easily beat off the attackers , chased them back to their chief town , and besieged them .
but they were surprised in the rear by a second force of dardani , which had approached their camp stealthily by mountain paths , and proceeded to storm and ransack it .
having lost their entire baggage and supplies , the bastarnae were obliged to withdraw from dardania and to return home .
most perished as they crossed the frozen danube on foot , only for the ice to give way .
despite the failure of philip's bastarnae strategy , the suspicion aroused by these events in the roman senate , which had been warned by the dardani of the bastarnae invasion , ensured the demise of macedonia as an independent state .
rome declared war on perseus in *num* bc and after the macedonian army was crushed at the battle of pydna ( *num* bc ) , macedonia was split up into *num* roman puppet-cantons ( *num* bc ) .
*num* years later , these were in turn abolished and annexed to the roman republic as the province of macedonia ( *num* bc ) .
the bastarnae first came into direct conflict with rome as a result of expansion into the lower danube region by the proconsuls ( governors ) of macedonia in the period 75-72 bc .
gaius scribonius curio ( proconsul 75-3 bc ) campaigned successfully against the dardani and the moesi , becoming the first roman general to reach the river danube with his army .
his successor , marcus licinius lucullus ( brother of the famous lucius lucullus ) , campaigned against the thracian bessi tribe and the moesi , ravaging the whole of moesia , the region between the haemus ( balkan ) mountain range and the danube .
in *num* bc , his troops occupied the greek coastal cities of scythia minor ( modern dobruja region , romania / bulgaria ) , which had sided with rome's hellenistic arch-enemy , king mithridates vi of pontus , in the third mithridatic war ( 73-63 bc ) .
the presence of roman forces in the danube delta was seen as a major threat by all the neighbouring transdanubian peoples : the peucini bastarnae , the sarmatians and , most importantly , by burebista ( ruled 82-44 bc ) , king of the getae .
the getae occupied the region today called wallachia as well as scythia minor and were either a dacian- or thracian- speaking people .
burebista had unified the getae tribes into a single kingdom , for which the greek cities were vital trade outlets .
in addition , he had established his hegemony over neighbouring sarmatian and bastarnae tribes .
at its peak , the getae kingdom reportedly was able to muster *num* , *num* warriors .
burebista led his transdanubian coalition in a struggle against roman encroachment , conducting many raids against roman allies in moesia and thrace , penetrating as far as macedonia and illyria .
the coalition's main chance came in *num* bc , when the greek cities rebelled against roman rule .
in *num* bc , the notoriously oppressive and militarily incompetent proconsul of macedonia , gaius antonius , nicknamed " hybrida " ( " the monster " , an uncle of the famous mark antony ) led an army against the greek cities .
as his army approached histria ( sinoe ) , antonius detached his entire mounted force from the marching column and led it away on a lengthy excursion , leaving his infantry without cavalry cover , a tactic he had already used with disastrous results against the dardani .
dio implies that he did so out of cowardice , in order to avoid the imminent clash with the opposition .
but it is more likely that he was pursuing a large enemy cavalry force , probably sarmatians .
a bastarnae host , which had crossed the danube to assist the histrians , promptly attacked , surrounded and massacred the roman infantry , capturing several of their " vexilla " ( military standards ) .
this battle resulted in the collapse of the roman position on the lower danube .
burebista apparently annexed the greek cities ( 55-48 bc ) .
at the same time , the subjugated " allied " tribes of moesia and thrace evidently repudiated their treaties with rome , as they had to be re-conquered by augustus in 29-8 bc ( see below ) .
for *num* bc , roman dictator-for-life julius caesar planned to lead a major campaign to crush burebista and his allies once and for all , but he was assassinated before it could start .
however , the campaign was made redundant by burebista's overthrow and death in the same year , after which his getae empire fragmented into *num* , later *num* independent petty kingdoms .
these were militarily far weaker , as strabo assessed their combined military potential at just *num* , *num* armed men , and were often involved in internecine warfare .
the geto-dacians did not again become a threat to roman hegemony in the lower danube until the rise of decebal *num* years later ( ad *num* ) .
once he had established himself as sole ruler of the roman state in *num* bc , caesar's grand-nephew and adopted son augustus inaugurated a strategy of advancing the empire's southeastern european border to the line of the danube from the alps , the dinaric alps and macedonia .
the primary objective was to increase strategic depth between the border and italy and also to provide a major fluvial supply-route between the roman armies in the region .
on the lower danube , which was given priority over the upper danube , this required the annexation of moesia .
the romans ' target were thus the tribes which inhabited moesia , namely ( from west to east ) the triballi , moesi and those getae who dwelt south of the danube .
the bastarnae were also a target because they had recently subjugated the triballi , whose territory lay on the southern bank of the danube between the tributary rivers " utus " ( vit ) and " ciabrus " ( tsibritsa ) , with their chief town at oescus ( gigen , bulgaria ) .
in addition , augustus wanted to avenge the defeat of c .
antonius at histria ( sinoe ) *num* years before and to recover the lost military standards .
these were held in a powerful fortress called genucla ( isaccea , near modern tulcea , romania , in the danube delta region ) , controlled by zyraxes , the local getan king .
the man selected for the task was marcus licinius crassus , grandson of crassus the triumvir and an experienced general at *num* years of age , who was appointed proconsul of macedonia in *num* bc .
the bastarnae provided the " casus belli " by crossing the haemus and attacking the dentheletae , a thracian tribe who were roman allies .
crassus marched to the dentheletae's assistance , but the bastarnae host hastily withdrew over the haemus at his approach .
crassus followed them closely into moesia but they would not be drawn into battle , withdrawing beyond the tsibritsa .
crassus now turned his attention to the moesi , his prime target .
after a successful campaign which resulted in the submission of a substantial section of the moesi , crassus again sought out the bastarnae .
discovering their location from some peace envoys they had sent to him , he lured them into battle near the tsibritsa by a stratagem .
hiding his main body of troops in a wood , he stationed as bait a smaller vanguard in open ground before the wood .
as expected , the bastarnae attacked the vanguard in force , only to find themselves entangled in the full-scale pitched battle with the romans that they had tried to avoid .
the bastarnae tried to retreat into the forest but were hampered by the wagon-train carrying their women and children , as these could not move through the trees .
trapped into fighting to save their families , the bastarnae were routed .
crassus personally killed their king , deldo , in combat , a feat which qualified him for rome's highest military honour , " spolia opima " , but augustus refused to award it on a technicality .
thousands of fleeing bastarnae perished , many asphyxiated in nearby woods by encircling fires set by the romans , others drowned trying to swim across the danube .
nevertheless , a substantial force dug themselves into a powerful hillfort .
crassus laid siege to fort , but had to enlist the assistance of rholes , a getan petty king , to dislodge them , for which service rholes was granted the title of " socius et amicus populi romani " ( " ally and friend of the roman people " ) .
the following year ( *num* bc ) , crassus marched on genucla .
petty king zyraxes escaped with his treasure and fled over the danube into scythia to seek aid from the bastarnae .
but before he was able to bring reinforcements , genucla fell to a combined land and fluvial assault by the romans .
the strategic result of crassus ' campaigns was the permanent annexation of moesia by rome .
about a decade later , in *num* bc , the bastarnae again clashed with rome during augustus ' conquest of pannonia ( the " bellum pannonicum " 14–9 bc ) .
inscription ae ( *num* ) *num* records a campaign on the hungarian plain by the augustan-era general marcus vinucius : " marcus vinucius .
.
.
[ patronymic ] , consul [ in *num* bc ] .
.

.
.
[ missing tribal name ] and anartii to the power of the emperor augustus and of the people of rome .
" most likely , the bastarnae , in alliance with dacians , were attempting to assist the hard-pressed illyrian / celtic tribes of pannonia in their resistance to rome .
it appears that in the final years of augustus ' rule , the bastarnae made their peace with rome .
the " res gestae divi augusti " ( " acts of the divine augustus " ad *num* ) , a self-congratulatory inscription commissioned by augustus to list his achievements , states that he received an embassy from the bastarnae seeking a treaty of friendship .
it appears that a treaty was concluded and apparently proved remarkably effective , as no hostilities with the bastarnae are recorded in surviving ancient sources until c .
*num* , some *num* years after augustus ' inscription was carved .
but surviving evidence for the history of this period is so thin that it cannot be excluded that the bastarnae clashed with rome during it .
the bastarnae may have been involved in the dacian wars of domitian ( 86-88 ) and trajan ( 101-102 and 105-106 ) , since these took place in the lower danube region and it is known that both sides were supported by neighbouring indigenous tribes .
in the late *ord* century , the " historia augusta " mentions that in the rule of marcus aurelius ( 161-80 ) , an alliance of lower danube tribes including the bastarnae , the sarmatian roxolani and the costoboci took advantage of the emperor's difficulties on the upper danube ( the marcomannic wars ) to invade roman territory .
during the late *ord* century , the main ethnic change in the northern black sea region was the immigration , from the vistula valley in the north , of the goths and accompanying germanic tribes such as the taifali and the hasdingi , a branch of the vandal people .
this migration was part of a series of major population movements in the european " barbaricum " ( the roman term for regions outside their empire ) .
the goths appear to have established a loose political hegemony over the existing tribes in the region .
under the leadership of the goths , a series of major invasions of the roman empire were launched by a grand coalition of lower danubian tribes from c .
*num* onwards .
the participation of the bastarnae in these is likely but largely unspecified , due to zosimus ' and other chroniclers ' tendency to lump all these tribes under the general term " scythians " - meaning all the inhabitants of scythia , rather than the specific iranic-speaking people called the scythians .
thus , in 250-1 , the bastarnae were probably involved in the gothic and sarmatian invasions which culminated in the roman defeat at the battle of abrittus and the slaying of the emperor decius ( *num* ) .
this disaster was the start of the third century crisis of the roman empire , a period of military and economic chaos .
at this critical moment , the roman army was crippled by the outbreak of a second smallpox pandemic , the plague of cyprian ( 251-70 ) .
the effects are described by zosimus as even worse than the earlier antonine plague ( 166-80 ) , which probably killed 15-30 % of the empire's inhabitants .
taking advantage of roman military disarray , a vast number of barbarian peoples overran much of the empire .
the sarmato-gothic alliance of the lower danube carried out major invasions of the balkans region in *num* , and in the periods 253-8 and 260-8 .
the peucini bastarnae are specifically mentioned in the *num* / *num* invasion , when the coalition built a fleet in the estuary of the river " tyras " ( dnieper ) .
the peucini bastarnae would have been critical to this venture since , as coastal and delta dwellers , they would have had seafaring experience that the nomadic sarmatians and goths lacked .
the barbarians sailed along the black sea coast to tomis in moesia inferior , which they tried to take by assault without success .
they then attacked the provincial capital marcianopolis ( devnya , bulg .
) , also in vain .
sailing on through the bosporus , the expedition laid siege to thessalonica in macedonia .
driven off by roman forces , the coalition host moved overland into thracia , where finally it was crushed by emperor claudius ii ( r .
268-70 ) at naissus ( *num* ) .
claudius ii was the first of a sequence of military emperors ( the so-called " illyrian emperors " from their main ethnic origin ) who restored order in the empire in the late *ord* century .
these emperors followed a policy of large-scale resettlement within the empire of defeated barbarian tribes , granting them land in return for an obligation of military service much heavier than the usual conscription quota .
the policy had the triple benefit , from the roman point of view , of weakening the hostile tribe , repopulating the plague-ravaged frontier provinces ( bringing their abandoned fields back into cultivation ) and providing a pool of first-rate recruits for the army .
but it could also be popular with the barbarian prisoners , who were often delighted by the prospect of a land grant within the empire .
in the *ord* century , such communities were known as " laeti " .
the emperor probus ( r .
276-82 ) is recorded as resettling *num* , *num* bastarnae in moesia , in addition to other peoples ( goths , gepids and vandals ) .
the bastarnae are reported to have honoured their oath of allegiance to the emperor , while the other resettled peoples mutinied while probus was distracted by usurpation attempts and ravaged the danubian provinces far and wide .
a further massive transfer of bastarnae was carried out by emperor diocletian ( ruled 284-305 ) after he and his colleague galerius defeated a coalition of bastarnae and carpi in *num* .
the remaining transdanubian bastarnae disappear into historical obscurity in the late empire .
neither of the main ancient sources for this period , ammianus marcellinus and zosimus , mention the bastarnae in their accounts of the *ord* century , possibly implying the loss of their separate identity , presumably assimilated by the regional hegemons , the goths .
such assimilation would have been facilitated if , as is possible , the bastarnae spoke an east germanic language closely related to gothic .
if the bastarnae remained an identifiable group , it is highly likely that they participated in the vast gothic-led migration , driven by hunnic pressure , that was admitted into moesia by emperor valens in *num* and eventually defeated and killed valens at adrianople in *num* .
although ammianus refers to the migrants collectively as " goths " , he states that , in addition , " taifali and other tribes " were involved .
however , after a gap of *num* years , there is a final mention of bastarnae in the *ord* century .
in *num* , the hunnic leader attila invaded gaul with a large army which was ultimately routed at the battle of châlons by a roman-led coalition under the general aetius .
attila's host , according to jordanes , included contingents from the " innumerable tribes that had been brought under his sway .
" one such were the bastarnae , according to the gallic nobleman sidonius apollinaris .
however , e .
a .
thompson argues that sidonius ' mention of bastarnae at chalons is probably false : his purpose was to write a panegyric and not a history , and sidonius added some spurious names to the list of real participants ( e .
g .
burgundians , sciri and franks ) for dramatic effect .
bi-directional text bi-directional text is text containing text in both text directionalities , both right-to-left ( rtl or dextrosinistral ) and left-to-right ( ltr or sinistrodextral ) .
it generally involves text containing different types of alphabets , but may also refer to boustrophedon , which is changing text directionality in each row .
some writing systems of the world , including the arabic and hebrew scripts or derived systems such as the persian , urdu , and yiddish scripts , are written in a form known as right-to-left ( rtl ) , in which writing begins at the right-hand side of a page and concludes at the left-hand side .
this is different from the left-to-right ( ltr ) direction used by the dominant latin script .
when ltr text is mixed with rtl in the same paragraph , each type of text is written in its own direction , which is known as " bi-directional text " .
this can get rather complex when multiple levels of quotation are used .
many computer programs fail to display bi-directional text correctly .
for example , the hebrew name sarah ( שרה ) is spelled : sin ( ש ) ( which appears rightmost ) , then resh ( ר ) , and finally heh ( ה ) ( which should appear leftmost ) .
"note : some web browsers may display the hebrew text in this article in the opposite direction .
" bidirectional script support is the capability of a computer system to correctly display bi-directional text .
the term is often shortened to " bidi " or " bidi " .
early computer installations were designed only to support a single writing system , typically for left-to-right scripts based on the latin alphabet only .
adding new character sets and character encodings enabled a number of other left-to-right scripts to be supported , but did not easily support right-to-left scripts such as arabic or hebrew , and mixing the two was not practical .
right-to-left scripts were introduced through encodings like iso / iec 8859-6 and iso / iec 8859-8 , storing the letters ( usually ) in writing and reading order .
it is possible to simply flip the left-to-right display order to a right-to-left display order , but doing this sacrifices the ability to correctly display left-to-right scripts .
with bidirectional script support , it is possible to mix scripts from different scripts on the same page , regardless of writing direction .
in particular , the unicode standard provides foundations for complete bidi support , with detailed rules as to how mixtures of left-to-right and right-to-left scripts are to be encoded and displayed .
the unicode standard calls for characters to be ordered ' logically ' , i .
e .
in the sequence they are intended to be interpreted , as opposed to ' visually ' , the sequence they appear .
this distinction is relevant for bidi support because at any bidi transition , the visual presentation ceases to be the ' logical ' one .
thus , in order to offer bidi support , unicode prescribes an algorithm for how to convert the logical sequence of characters into the correct visual presentation .
for this purpose , the unicode encoding standard divides all its characters into one of four types : ' strong ' , ' weak ' , ' neutral ' , and ' explicit formatting ' .
strong characters are those with definite directionality .
examples of this type of character include most alphabetic characters , syllabic characters , han ideographs , non-european or non-arabic digits , and punctuation characters " that are specific to only those scripts " .
weak characters are those with vague directionality .
examples of this type of character include european digits , eastern arabic-indic digits , arithmetic symbols , and currency symbols .
unless a directional override is present numbers are always encoded ( and entered ) big-endian , and the numerals rendered ltr .
the weak directionality only applies to the placement of the number in its entirety .
neutral characters have directionality indeterminable without context .
examples include paragraph separators , tabs , and most other whitespace characters .
punctuation symbols that are common to many scripts , such as the colon , comma , full-stop , and the no-break-space also fall within this category .
explicit formatting characters , also referred to as " directional formatting characters " , are special unicode sequences that direct the unicode algorithm to modify its default behavior .
these characters are subdivided into " marks " , " embeddings " , " isolates " , and " overrides " .
their effects continue until the occurrence of either a paragraph separator , or a " pop " character .
if a " weak " character is followed by another " weak " character , the algorithm will look at the first neighbouring " strong " character .
sometimes this leads to unintentional display errors .
these errors are corrected or prevented with " pseudo-strong " characters .
such unicode control characters are called " marks " .
the mark ( or ) is to be inserted into a location to make an enclosed weak character inherit its writing direction .
for example , to correctly display the for an english name brand ( ltr ) in an arabic ( rtl ) passage , an lrm mark is inserted after the trademark symbol if the symbol is not followed by ltr text ( e .
g .
" " ) .
if the lrm mark is not added , the weak character ™ will be neighbored by a strong ltr character and a strong rtl character .
hence , in an rtl context , it will be considered to be rtl , and displayed in an incorrect order ( e .
g .
" " ) .
the " embedding " directional formatting characters are the classical unicode method of explicit formatting , and as of unicode *num* .
*num* , are being discouraged in favor of " isolates " .
an " embedding " signals that a piece of text is to be treated as directionally distinct .
the text within the scope of the embedding formatting characters is not independent of the surrounding text .
also , characters within an embedding can affect the ordering of characters outside .
unicode *num* .
*num* recognized that directional embeddings usually have too strong an effect on their surroundings and are thus unnecessarily difficult to use .
the " isolate " directional formatting characters signal that a piece of text is to be treated as directionally isolated from its surroundings .
as of unicode *num* .
*num* , these are the formatting characters that are being encouraged in new documents – once target platforms are known to support them .
these formatting characters were introduced after it became apparent that directional embeddings usually have too strong an effect on their surroundings and are thus unnecessarily difficult to use .
unlike the legacy ' embedding ' directional formatting characters , ' isolate ' characters have no effect on the ordering of the text outside their scope .
isolates can be nested , and may be placed within embeddings and overrides .
the " override " directional formatting characters allow for special cases , such as for part numbers ( e .
g .
to force a part number made of mixed english , digits and hebrew letters to be written from right to left ) , and are recommended to be avoided wherever possible .
as is true of the other directional formatting characters , " overrides " can be nested one inside another , and in embeddings and isolates .
the " pop " directional formatting characters terminate the scope of the most recent " embedding " , " override " , or " isolate " .
in the algorithm , each sequence of concatenated strong characters is called a " run " .
a " weak " character that is located between two " strong " characters with the same orientation will inherit their orientation .
a " weak " character that is located between two " strong " characters with a different writing direction , will inherit the main context's writing direction ( in an ltr document the character will become ltr , in an rtl document , it will become rtl ) .
egyptian hieroglyphs can be written bi-directionally , where the signs had a distinct " head " that faced the beginning of a line and " tail " that faced the end .
chinese characters can be written in either direction as well as vertically ( top to bottom then right to left ) , especially in signs ( such as plaques ) , but the orientation of the individual characters is never changed .
this can often be seen on tour buses in china , where the company name customarily runs from the front of the vehicle to its rear — that is , from right to left on the right side of the bus , and from left to right on the left side of the bus .
english texts on the right side of the vehicle are also quite commonly written in reverse order .
( see pictures of tour bus and post vehicle below .
) likewise , other cjk scripts made up of the same square characters , such as the japanese writing system and korean writing system , can also be written in any direction , although left-to-right , top-to-bottom and top-to-bottom , right-to-left are most common .
boustrophedon is a writing style found in ancient greek inscriptions and in hungarian runes .
this method of writing alternates direction , and usually reverses the individual characters , on each successive line .
moon type is an embossed adaptation of the latin alphabet invented as a tactile alphabet for the blind .
initially the text changed direction ( but not character orientation ) at the end of the lines .
special embossed lines connected the end of a line and the beginning of the next .
around *num* , it changed to a left-to-right orientation .
dartmoor dartmoor is a moor in southern devon , england .
protected by national park status as dartmoor national park , it covers .
the granite which forms the uplands dates from the carboniferous period of geological history .
the moorland is capped with many exposed granite hilltops known as tors , providing habitats for dartmoor wildlife .
the highest point is high willhays , above sea level .
the entire area is rich in antiquities and archaeology .
dartmoor is managed by the dartmoor national park authority , whose *num* members are drawn from devon county council , local district councils and government .
parts of dartmoor have been used as military firing ranges for over *num* years .
the public is granted extensive land access rights on dartmoor ( including restricted access to the firing ranges ) and it is a popular tourist destination .
dartmoor includes the largest area of granite in britain , with about at the surface , though most of it is under superficial peat deposits .
the granite ( or more specifically adamellite ) was intruded at depth as a pluton into the surrounding sedimentary rocks during the carboniferous period , probably about *num* million years ago .
it is generally accepted that the present surface is not far below the original top of the pluton ; evidence for this includes partly digested shale xenoliths , contamination of the granite and the existence of two patches of altered sedimentary rock on top of the granite .
a considerable gravity anomaly is associated with the dartmoor pluton as with other such plutons .
measurement of the anomaly has helped to determine the likely shape and extent of the rock mass at depth .
dartmoor is known for its tors – hills topped with outcrops of bedrock , which in granite country such as this are usually rounded boulder-like formations .
more than *num* of the hills of dartmoor have the word " tor " in their name but quite a number do not .
however , this does not appear to relate to whether or not there is an outcrop of rock on their summit .
the tors are the focus of an annual event known as the ten tors challenge , when around *num* people aged between *num* and *num* walk for distances of *num* , *num* or *num* km ( *num* , *num* or *num* mi ) between ten tors on many differing routes .
the highest points on dartmoor are on the northern moor : high willhays , , ( ) and yes tor , , ( ) the highest points on the southern moor are ryder's hill , , ( ) , snowdon , ( ) , and an unnamed point , at ( ) , between langcombe hill and shell top .
the best-known tor on dartmoor is haytor ( called hey tor by william crossing ) , , ( ) .
for a more complete list see list of dartmoor tors and hills .
the high ground of dartmoor forms the catchment area for many of devon's rivers .
as well as shaping the landscape , these have traditionally provided a source of power for moor industries such as tin mining and quarrying .
the moor takes its name from the river dart , which starts as the east dart and west dart and then becomes a single river at dartmeet .
it leaves the moor at buckfastleigh , flowing through totnes below where it opens up into a long ria , reaching the sea at dartmouth .
for a full list , expand the " rivers of dartmoor " navigational box at the bottom of this page .
much more rain falls on dartmoor than in the surrounding lowlands .
as much of the national park is covered in thick layers of peat ( decaying vegetation ) , the rain is usually absorbed quickly and distributed slowly , so the moor is rarely dry .
in areas where water accumulates , dangerous bogs or mires can result .
some of these , topped with bright green moss , are known to locals as " feather beds " or " quakers " , because they can shift ( or ' quake ' ) beneath a person's feet .
quakers result from sphagnum moss growing over the water that accumulates in the hollows in the granite .
the vegetation of the bogs depends on the type and location .
blanket bog , which forms on the highest land where the rainfall exceeds a year , consists mainly of cotton-grass ( " eriophorum " species ) , sedges ( " carex " and " rhynchospora " ) , " bog asphodel " and " common tormentil " , with " sphagnum " thriving in the wettest patches .
the valley bogs have lush growth of rushes , with sphagnum , cross-leaved heath , sundews and several other species .
some of the bogs on dartmoor have achieved notoriety .
fox tor mires was supposedly the inspiration for great grimpen mire in conan doyle's novel " the hound of the baskervilles " , although there is a waymarked footpath across it .
sabine baring-gould , in his " book of dartmoor " ( *num* ) related the story of a man who was making his way through aune mire at the head of the river avon when he came upon a top-hat brim down on the surface of the mire .
he kicked it , whereupon a voice called out : " what be you a-doin ' to my ' at ? " the man replied , " be there now a chap under'n ? " " ees , i reckon , " was the reply , " and a hoss under me likewise .
" along with the rest of south west england , dartmoor has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than locations at similar height in the rest of england .
at princetown , near the centre of the moor at a height of , january and february are the coldest months with mean minimum temperatures around .
july and august are the warmest months with mean daily maxima not reaching .
compared with teignmouth , which is on the coast about to the east , the average maximum and minimum temperatures are and lower respectively , and frost is at least five times as frequent .
on the highest ground , in the north of the moor , the growing season is less than *num* days – this contrasts with some *num* days along most of the south coast of the county .
rainfall tends to be associated with atlantic depressions or with convection .
in summer , convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of rainfall falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year .
the wettest months are november and december and on the highest parts of the moor the average annual total rainfall is over .
this compares with less than in the lower land to the east around the exe estuary , which is in the rain shadow of the moor .
due to the influence of the gulf stream snowfall is not common , though due to its high altitude it is more vulnerable to snowfall than surrounding regions .
between *num* and *num* met office data shows that there was an average of *num* days when snow fell on the moor , and over *num* days a year with hail , which is as high as anywhere else in the country .
this results when cold polar maritime air that has travelled over a large expanse of warmer ocean is forced to rise over high country .
when average temperatures at princetown between *num* and *num* are compared , the average annual temperature in the decade 1990–2000 was up by and the late winter temperature increased by .
because of dartmoor's height and granite geology , it experiences strong winds and has acidic soils .
in consequence it has been subject to very little intensive farming , and all these factors combine to form the basis of the important ecosystems found here .
the landscape is one of granite with peat bogs overlying it .
while the moors topped with granite tors are the most iconic part of dartmoor's landscape , only about half of dartmoor is actually moorland .
equally important for wildlife are the blanket bogs , upland heaths and the oak woodlands which are all of global importance .
dartmoor is a special area of conservation ( sac ) with four habitats ( " northern atlantic wet heaths with erica tetralix " ; " european dry heaths " ; " blanket bog"s and " old sessile oak woods with ilex and blechnum in the british isles " ) being listed as primary reasons for the selection of dartmoor as a sac .
in addition the area has a population of the southern damselfly which is also a primary reason for its selection along with populations of atlantic salmon and otter being qualifying reasons .
wistman's wood is one of the old sessile oak woods which contribute to the listing of dartmoor as a sac and is possibly a surviving fragment from the earliest neolithic woodland clearances .
it is home to exceptional epiphytic mosses , liverworts and lichens .
nearly *num* species of moss and liverwort are found in the wood along with *num* types of lichen , including smith's horsehair lichen , speckled sea-storm lichen and pendulous wing-moss .
over *num* species of lichens grow on the exposed surfaces of the granite tors , including granite-speck rim-lichen , purple rock lichen , brown cobblestone lichen and goldspot lichen and many rare lichen grow on rocks exposed by mining which are rich in heavy metals .
on the upland heaths heather ( ling ) and bell heather are common along with western gorse .
in dry grassy areas tormentil , heath bedstraw and heath milkwort are all common .
cross-leaved heath and purple moor grass grow in wetter spots and in the boggy areas many different species of sphagnum and other mosses can be found along with liverworts , hare's-tail cotton-grass , round-leaved sundew and bog asphodel and in the valley bottoms , many different sedges , bogbean and pale butterwort all grow .
a large variety of bird species can be found on dartmoor including ones that have declined elsewhere in the uk , such as skylark and snipe , or are even rare nationally , such as the ring ouzel and the cuckoo .
there are internationally important populations of meadow pipit and stonechat .
woodland birds include a number of migrant species , like the pied flycatcher , the wood warbler or the common redstart .
mammals found here include otters , hazel dormice and nearly all of the uk's *num* bat species .
three rare species , the barbastelle , and the greater and lesser horseshoe bats are of particular importance .
the upper reaches of the rivers , are spawning grounds for salmon and trout and palmate newts , frogs and toads breed in the numerous small pools .
two shrimp species can be found on dartmoor : fairy shrimp that can be found in temporary pools and in underground streams very rare cave shrimp .
the world's largest land slug , the ash black , is also found .
reptiles include common lizards and adders .
the farmland in the wet valleys around the edge of the moors is the most important habitat for insects including the marsh fritillary butterfly , southern damselfly , narrow-bordered bee hawkmoth and bog hoverfly .
areas of bracken are home to the high brown fritillary and pearl-bordered fritillary .
insects found in the heathlands include the emperor moth , green hairstreak and the bilberry bumblebee .
the old oak woodlands have a distinctive group of insects including the blue ground beetle and heckford's pygmy moth , a species found nowhere else in the world .
the majority of the prehistoric remains on dartmoor date back to the late neolithic and early bronze age .
indeed , dartmoor contains the largest concentration of bronze age remains in the united kingdom , which suggests that this was when a larger population moved onto the hills of dartmoor .
the large systems of bronze age fields , divided by reaves , cover an area of over of the lower moors .
the climate at the time was warmer than today , and much of today's moorland was covered with trees .
the prehistoric settlers began clearing the forest , and established the first farming communities .
fire was the main method of clearing land , creating pasture and swidden types of fire-fallow farmland .
areas less suited for farming tended to be burned for livestock grazing .
over the centuries these neolithic practices greatly expanded the upland moors , and contributed to the acidification of the soil and the accumulation of peat and bogs .
after a few thousand years the mild climate deteriorated leaving these areas uninhabited and consequently relatively undisturbed to the present day .
the highly acidic soil has ensured that no organic remains have survived , but the durability of the granite has meant that the remains of buildings , enclosures and monuments have survived well , as have flint tools .
it should be noted that a number of remains were " restored " by enthusiastic victorians and that , in some cases , they have placed their own interpretation on how an area may have looked .
numerous prehistoric menhirs ( more usually referred to locally as standing stones or longstones ) , stone circles , kistvaens , cairns and stone rows are to be found on the moor .
the most significant sites include : there are also an estimated *num* , *num* hut circles still surviving although many have been raided over the centuries by the builders of the traditional dry stone walls .
these are the remnants of bronze age houses .
the smallest are around in diameter , and the largest may be up to five times this size .
some have l-shaped porches to protect against wind and rain ; some particularly good examples are to be found at grimspound .
it is believed that they would have had a conical roof , supported by timbers and covered in turf or thatch .
there are also numerous kistvaens , neolithic stone box-like tombs .
the climate became wetter and cooler over the course of a thousand years from around *num* bc , resulting in much of high dartmoor being largely abandoned by its early inhabitants .
it was not until the early mediaeval period that the weather again became warmer , and settlers moved back onto the moors .
like their ancient forebears , they also used the natural granite to build their homes , preferring a style known as the longhouse — some of which are still inhabited today , although they have been clearly adapted over the centuries .
many are now being used as farm buildings , while others were abandoned and fell into ruin .
the earliest surviving farms , still in operation today , are known as the ancient tenements .
most of these date back to the *ord* century and sometimes earlier .
some way into the moor stands the town of princetown , the site of dartmoor prison , which was originally built by isbell rowe & company , plymouth , for prisoners of war from the napoleonic wars and the war of *num* .
the prison has an incorrect reputation for being escape-proof , due to both the buildings themselves and its physical location .
the dartmoor landscape is scattered with the marks left by the many generations who have lived and worked there over the centuries – such as the remains of the dartmoor tin-mining industry , and farmhouses long since abandoned .
indeed , the industrial archaeology of dartmoor is a subject in its own right .
dartmoor is known for its myths and legends .
it is reputedly the haunt of pixies , a headless horseman , a mysterious pack of " spectral hounds " , and a large black dog , among others .
during the great thunderstorm of *num* , the moorland village of widecombe-in-the-moor was even said to have been visited by the devil .
many landmarks have ancient legends and ghost stories associated with them , such as the allegedly haunted jay's grave , the ancient burial site of childe's tomb , the rock pile called bowerman's nose , and the stone crosses that mark former mediaeval routes across the moor .
a few stories have emerged in recent decades , such as the " hairy hands " , that are said to attack motorists on the b3212 near two bridges ; and the " beast of dartmoor " , a supposed big cat .
dartmoor has inspired a number of artists and writers , such as sir arthur conan doyle in " the hound of the baskervilles " and " the adventure of silver blaze " , r .
d .
blackmore , eden phillpotts , beatrice chase , agatha christie , rosamunde pilcher , and the reverend sabine baring-gould .
in " harry potter and the goblet of fire " , the fictional *num* quidditch world cup final between ireland and bulgaria was hosted on the moor .
over half of dartmoor national park ( *num* .
*num* % ) is private land ; the forest of dartmoor being the major part of this , owned by the duke of cornwall .
the ministry of defence owns *num* % ( see below ) , *num* .
*num* % is owned by water companies ( see dartmoor reservoirs ) , *num* .
*num* % by the national trust , *num* .
*num* % by the forestry commission and *num* .
*num* % by dartmoor's national park authority .
about *num* % of dartmoor is common land .
dartmoor differs from some other national parks in england and wales , in that since the dartmoor commons act *num* much of it has been designated as ' access land ' , which , although it remains privately owned , has no restrictions on where walkers can roam .
in addition to this access land , there are about of public rights of way on dartmoor , and many kilometres of permitted footpaths and bridleways where the owner allows access .
because of the *num* act , dartmoor was largely unaffected by the countryside and rights of way act *num* , which established similar rights in other rural parts of the country , but in *num* , this act opened up much of the remaining restricted land to walkers .
there is a tradition of military usage of dartmoor dating back to the napoleonic wars .
today , a large british army training camp remains at okehampton — also the site of an airbase during the second world war .
the ministry of defence ( mod ) uses three areas of the northern moor for manoeuvres and live-firing exercises , totalling , or just over *num* % of the national park .
red and white posts mark the boundaries of these military areas ( shown on ordnance survey *num* : *num* , *num* scale maps ) .
flagpoles on many tors in and around the ranges fly red flags when firing is taking place .
at other times , members of the public are allowed access .
blank rounds may also be used , but the mod does not notify the public of this in advance .
some " challenge " and charitable events take place with assistance of the military on dartmoor including the long established ten tors event and the more recent dartmoor beast .
dartmoor's fictional use as an mod centre for animal testing called baskerville was referenced in the bbc drama " sherlock " episode " the hounds of baskerville " .
the disused rippon tor rifle range was built to train soldiers during the second world war , and remained in use until its closure in *num* .
throughout human history , the landscape has been exploited for industrial purposes .
in recent years , controversy has surrounded the work of industrial conglomerates imerys and sibelco ( formerly watts blake bearne ) , who have used parts of the moor for china clay mining .
licences were granted by the british government but were recently renounced after sustained public pressure from bodies such as the dartmoor preservation association .
the british government has made promises to protect the integrity of the moor ; however , the cost of compensating companies for these licences , which may not have been granted in today's political climate , could prove prohibitive .
the military use of the moor has been another source of controversy , such as when training was extended in january *num* .
the national park authority received *num* , *num* objections before making the decision .
objectors claimed that dartmoor should be an area for recreation , and that the training disturbs the peace .
those who objected included the open spaces society and the dartmoor preservation association .
during her lifetime , lady sayer was another outspoken critic of the damage which she perceived that the army was doing to the moor .
dartmoor has a resident population of about *num* , *num* , which swells considerably during holiday periods with incoming tourists .
the largest settlements within the national park are ashburton ( the largest with a population of about *num* , *num* ) , buckfastleigh , moretonhampstead , princetown , yelverton , horrabridge , south brent , christow , and chagford .
for a full list , expand the " settlements of dartmoor " navigational box at the bottom of this page .
until the early *ord* century dartmoor was not considered to be a place worth visiting : in the 1540s john leland wrote in his " itinerary " that " dartmore is muche a wilde morish and forest ground " , and even by *num* richard gough's opinion was that it is a " dreary mountainous tract " .
at the turn of the *ord* century john swete was one of the first people to visit dartmoor for pleasure and his journals and watercolour paintings now provide a valuable historical resource .
the oldest leisure pursuit on the moor is hill walking .
william crossing's definitive " guide to dartmoor " was published in *num* , and in *num* a plaque and letterbox in his memory were placed at duck's pool on the southern moor .
parts of the abbots way , two moors way and the templer way are on dartmoor .
letterboxing originated on dartmoor in the *ord* century and has become increasingly popular in recent decades .
watertight containers , or ' letterboxes ' , are hidden throughout the moor , each containing a visitor's book and a rubber stamp .
visitors take an impression of the letterbox's rubber stamp as proof of finding the box and record their visit by stamping their own personal stamp in the letterbox's logbook .
a recent related development is geocaching .
geocache clues make use of gps coordinates , whereas letterboxing clues tend to consist of grid references and compass bearings .
whitewater kayaking and canoeing are popular on the rivers due to the high rainfall and their high quality , though for environmental reasons access is restricted to the winter months .
the river dart is the most prominent meeting place , the section known as the loop being particularly popular .
other white water rivers are the erme , tavy , plym and meavy .
other activities are rock climbing on the granite tors and outcrops , some of the well-known venues being haytor , hound tor and the dewerstone ; horse riding , which can be undertaken on any of the common land ; cycling ( but not on open moorland ) ; and angling for wild brown trout , sea trout and salmon—although much of the river fishing on dartmoor is privately owned , permits are available for some stretches .
the park's main visitor centre is located in princetown and features exhibits about dartmoor's history , culture and wildlife , as well as changing displays of local art .
the visitor centres located in postbridge and haytor feature information , maps , guidebooks and items for exploring the area .
alexander jagiellon alexander i jagiellon ( ; ) ( *num* august *num* – *num* august *num* ) of the house of jagiellon was the grand duke of lithuania and later also king of poland .
he was the fourth son of casimir iv jagiellon .
he was elected grand duke of lithuania on the death of his father ( *num* ) , and king of poland on the death of his brother john i albert ( *num* ) .
alexander was born as the fourth son of king casimir iv jagiellon of poland and elisabeth habsburg of hungary , daughter of the king albert of hungary .
at the time of his father's death in *num* , his eldest brother vladislaus had already become king of bohemia ( *num* ) and hungary and croatia ( *num* ) , and the next oldest brother , casimir , had died ( *num* ) after leading an ascetic and pious life in his final years , resulting in his eventual canonization .
while the third oldest brother , john i albert was chosen by the polish nobility ( " szlachta " ) to be the next king of poland , the lithuanians instead elected alexander to be their next grand duke .
the greatest challenge that alexander faced upon assuming control of the grand duchy was an attack on lithuania by grand duke of muscovy ivan iii and his allies , the tatars of the crimean khanate , which commenced shortly after his coronation .
ivan iii considered himself the heir to the lands of kievan rus ' , and was striving to take back the territory previously gained by lithuania .
unable to successfully stop the incursions , alexander sent a delegation to moscow to make a peace settlement , which was signed in *num* and ceded extensive land over to the grand duchy of muscovy .
in an additional effort to instill a peace between lithuania and muscovy , alexander was betrothed to helena , the daughter of ivan iii ; they were married in vilnius on *num* february *num* .
the peace did not last long , however , as ivan iii resumed hostilities in *num* .
the most the grand duke of lithuania could do was to garrison smolensk and other strongholds and employ his wife helena to mediate another truce between him and her father after the disastrous battle of vedrosha ( *num* ) .
in the terms of this truce , lithuania had to surrender about a third of its territory to the nascent expansionist russian state .
on *num* june *num* , alexander's older brother john i albert died suddenly , and alexander was crowned king of poland on *num* december of that year .
alexander's shortage of funds immediately made him subservient to the polish senate and " szlachta " , who deprived him of control of the mint ( then one of the most lucrative sources of revenue for the polish kings ) , curtailed his prerogatives , and generally endeavored to reduce him to a subordinate position .
in *num* , the " sejm " passed the act of " nihil novi " , which forbade the king to issue laws without the consent of the nobility , represented by the two legislative chambers , except for laws governing royal cities , crown lands , mines , fiefdoms , royal peasants , and jews .
this was another step in poland's progression towards a " noble's democracy " .
during alexander's reign , poland suffered additional humiliation at the hands of her subject principality , moldavia .
only the death of stephen , the great " hospodar " of moldavia , enabled poland still to hold her own on the danube river .
meanwhile the liberality of pope julius ii , who issued no fewer than *num* bulls in favor of poland and granted alexander peter's pence and other financial help , enabled him to restrain somewhat the arrogance of the teutonic order .
alexander jagiellon never felt at home in poland , and bestowed his favor principally upon his fellow lithuanians , the most notable of whom was the wealthy lithuanian magnate michael glinski , who justified his master's confidence by his great victory over the tatars at kleck ( *num* august *num* ) , news of which was brought to alexander on his deathbed in vilnius .
it is important to note that alexander was the last known ruler of the gediminid dynasty to have maintained the family's ancestral lithuanian language .
after his death , polish became the sole language of the family , thus fully polonising the jagiellons .
in *num* , during the refurbishment of vilnius cathedral , the forgotten sarcophagus of alexander was discovered , and has since been put on display .
armageddon according to the book of revelation in the new testament of the bible , armageddon ( , from " harmagedōn " , late latin : , from hebrew : har megiddo ) is the prophesied location of a gathering of armies for a battle during the end times , variously interpreted as either a literal or a symbolic location .
the term is also used in a generic sense to refer to any end of the world scenario .
"mount " tel megiddo is not actually a mountain , but a tell ( a hill created by many generations of people living and rebuilding on the same spot ) on which ancient forts were built to guard the via maris , an ancient trade route linking egypt with the northern empires of syria , anatolia and mesopotamia .
megiddo was the location of various ancient battles , including one in the *ord* century bc and one in *num* bc .
modern megiddo is a town approximately west-southwest of the southern tip of the sea of galilee in the kishon river area in israel .
the word " armageddon " appears only once in the greek new testament , in .
the word is transliterated to greek from hebrew " har məgiddô " ( ) , " har " ( strong h2022 ) meaning " a mountain or range of hills ( sometimes used figuratively ) : - hill ( country ) , mount ( -ain ) , x promotion .
" this is a shortened form of " harar " ( strong h2042 ) " to loom up ; a mountain ; -hill , mount " .
" megiddo " ( strong מְגִדּוֹן h4023 ) / meg-id-do' / " megiddon or megiddo , a place of crowds .
" ) the name refers to a fortification made by king ahab ( 869–850 bc ) that dominated the plain of jezreel .
megiddo is mentioned twelve times in the old testament , ten times in reference to the ancient city of megiddo , and twice with reference to " the plain of megiddo " , most probably simply meaning " the plain next to the city " .
none of these old testament passages describes the city of megiddo as being associated with any particular prophetic beliefs .
the one new testament reference to the city of armageddon found in also makes no specific mention of any armies being predicted to one day gather in this city , but instead seems to predict only that " they ( will gather ) the kings together to .
.
.
armageddon " .
the text does however seem to imply , based on the text from the earlier passage of revelation *num* : *num* , that the purpose of this gathering of kings in the " place called armageddon " is " for the war of the great day of god , the almighty " .
because of the seemingly highly symbolic and even cryptic language of this one new testament passage , some christian scholars conclude that mount armageddon must be an idealized location .
r .
j .
rushdoony says , " there are no mountains of megiddo , only the plains of megiddo .
this is a deliberate destruction of the vision of any literal reference to the place .
" other scholars , including c .
c .
torrey , kline and jordan argue that the word is derived from the hebrew " moed " ( ) , meaning " assembly " .
thus , " armageddon " would mean " mountain of assembly , " which jordan says is " a reference to the assembly at mount sinai , and to its replacement , mount zion .
" the traditional viewpoint interprets this bible prophecy to be symbolic of the progression of the world toward the " great day of god , the almighty " in which the great looming mountain of god's just and holy wrath is poured out against unrepentant sinners , led by satan , in a literal end-of-the-world final confrontation .
armageddon is the symbolic name given to this event based on scripture references regarding divine obliteration of god's enemies .
the hermeneutical method supports this position by referencing judges *num* and *num* where god miraculously destroys the enemy of his elect , israel , at megiddo .
christian scholar william hendriksen says : in his discussion of armageddon , j .
dwight pentecost has devoted a chapter to the subject , titled " the campaign of armageddon " , in which he discusses armageddon as a campaign and not a specific battle , which will be fought in the middle east .
pentecost writes : pentecost then discusses the location of this campaign , and mentions the " hill of megiddo " and other geographic locations such as " the valley of jehoshaphat " and " the valley of the passengers " , " lord coming from edom or idumea , south of jerusalem , when he returns from the judgment " ; and jerusalem itself .
pentecost further describes the area involved : pentecost then outlines the biblical time period for this campaign to occur and with further arguments concludes that it must take place with the *ord* week of daniel .
the invasion of israel by the northern confederacy " will bring the beast and his armies to the defense of israel as her protector " .
he then uses daniel to further clarify his thinking : ( dan .
*num* : 40b-45 ) .
again , events are listed by pentecost in his book : after the destruction of the beast at the second coming of jesus , the promised kingdom is set up , in which jesus and the saints will rule for a thousand years .
satan is then loosed " for a season " and goes out to deceive the nations , specifically , gog and magog .
the army mentioned attacks the saints in the new jerusalem , they are defeated by a judgment of fire coming down from heaven , and then comes the great white throne judgment , which includes all of those through the ages and these are cast into the lake of fire , which event is also known as the " second death " and gehenna , not to be confused with hell , which is satan's domain .
pentecost describes this as follows : jehovah's witnesses believe that armageddon is the means by which god will fulfill his purpose for the earth to be populated with happy healthy humans free of sin and death .
they teach that the armies of heaven will eradicate all who oppose the kingdom of god , wiping out all wicked humans on earth , leaving only righteous mankind .
they believe that the gathering of all the nations of the earth refers to the uniting of the world's political powers , as a gradual process beginning in *num* and seen later in manifestations such as the league of nations and the united nations following the first and second world wars .
these political powers are said to be influenced by satan and his demons in opposition to god's kingdom .
babylon the great is interpreted as the world empire of false religion , and that it will be destroyed by the beast just prior to armageddon .
witnesses believe that after all other religions have been destroyed , the governments will turn to persecute them , and that god will then intervene , precipitating armageddon .
jehovah's witnesses teach that the armies of heaven , led by jesus , will then destroy all forms of human government and then jesus , along with a selected *num* , *num* humans , will rule earth for *num* , *num* years .
they believe that satan and his demons will be bound for that period , unable to influence mankind .
after the *num* , *num* years are ended , and the second resurrection has taken place , satan is released and allowed to tempt the perfect human race one last time .
those who follow satan are destroyed , along with him , leaving the earth , and humankind at peace with god forever , free of sin and death .
the religion's current teaching on armageddon originated in *num* with former watch tower society president j .
f .
rutherford , who based his interpretations on the books of exodus , jeremiah , ezekiel and psalms as well as additional material from the books of samuel , kings and chronicles .
the doctrine marked a further break from the teachings of watch tower society founder charles taze russell , who for decades had taught that the final war would be an anarchistic struggle for domination on earth .
tony wills , author of a historical study of jehovah's witnesses , wrote that rutherford seemed to relish his descriptions of how completely the wicked would be destroyed at armageddon , dwelling at great length on prophecies of destruction .
he stated that towards the close of his ministry rutherford allocated about half the space available in " the watchtower " magazines to discussion of armageddon .
the teachings of the seventh-day adventist church state that the terms " armageddon " , " day of the lord " and " the second coming of christ " all describe the same event .
seventh-day adventists further teach that the current religious movements taking place in the world are setting the stage for armageddon , and they are concerned by an anticipated unity between spiritualism , american protestantism and roman catholicism .
a further significant difference in seventh-day adventist theology is the teaching that the events of armageddon will leave the earth desolate for the duration of the millennium .
they teach that the righteous will be taken to heaven while the rest of humanity will be destroyed , leaving satan with no one to tempt and effectively " bound .
" the final re-creation of a " new heaven and a new earth .
" then follows the millennium .
for christadelphians , armageddon marks the " great climax of history when the nations would be gathered together ' into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon ' , and the judgment on them would herald the setting up of the kingdom of god .
" from bahá'í literature a number of interpretations of the expectations surrounding the battle of armageddon may be inferred , three of them being associated with events surrounding the world wars .
the first interpretation deals with a series of tablets written by bahá'u'lláh , founder of the bahá'í faith , to be sent to various kings and rulers .
the second , and best-known one , relates to events near the end of world war i involving general allenby and the battle of megiddo ( *num* ) wherein world powers are said to have drawn soldiers from many parts of the world to engage in battle at megiddo .
in winning this battle allenby also prevented the ottomans from killing ' abdu'l-baha , then head of the baha'i faith , whom they had intended to crucify .
a third interpretation reviews the overall progress of the world wars , and the situation in the world before and after .
the idea that a final battle of armageddon will be fought at tel megiddo has had a wide influence , especially in the us .
according to donald e .
wagner , professor of religion and director of the center for middle eastern studies at north park university , ronald reagan was an adherent of " armageddon theology , " and " seemed to blend his political analysis with his armageddon theology quite naturally .
" an american militia group called hutaree , based on the idea that it will soon defend itself from the antichrist's armies , received wide attention in *num* , when several members were indicted for plotting to kill a police officer and plant roadside bombs along the funeral procession .
the charges were dismissed .
digital synthesizer a digital synthesizer is a synthesizer that uses digital signal processing ( dsp ) techniques to make musical sounds .
this in contrast to older analog synthesizers , which produce music using analog electronics , and samplers , which play back digital recordings of acoustic , electric , or electronic instruments .
some digital synthesizers emulate analog synthesizers ; others include sampling capability in addition to digital synthesis .
the very earliest digital synthesis experiments were made with computers , as part of academic research into sound generation .
in *num* , the japanese company yamaha licensed the algorithms for frequency modulation synthesis ( fm synthesis ) from john chowning , who had experimented with it at stanford university since *num* .
yamaha's engineers began adapting chowning's algorithm for use in a commercial digital synthesizer , adding improvements such as the " key scaling " method to avoid the introduction of distortion that normally occurred in analog systems during frequency modulation , though it would take several years before yamaha were to release their fm digital synthesizers .
in the 1970s , yamaha were granted a number of patents , under the company's former name " nippon gakki seizo kabushiki kaisha " , evolving chowning's early work on fm synthesis technology .
yamaha built the first prototype digital synthesizer in *num* .
released in *num* , the casio vl-1 was the first commercial digital synthesizer , selling for $69 .
*num* .
yamaha eventually commercialized their fm synthesis technology and released the first fm digital synthesizer in *num* , the yamaha gs-1 , but at an expensive retail price of $16 , *num* .
early commercial digital synthesizers used simple hard-wired digital circuitry to implement techniques such as additive synthesis and fm synthesis .
other techniques , such as wavetable synthesis and physical modeling , only became possible with the advent of high-speed microprocessor and digital signal processing technology .
two other early commercial digital synthesizers were the fairlight cmi , introduced in *num* , and the new england digital synclavier ii , introduced in *num* .
the fairlight cmi was a sampling synthesizer , while the synclavier originally used fm synthesis technology licensed from yamaha , before adding sampling synthesis later in the 1980s .
the fairlight cmi and the synclavier were both expensive systems , retailing for more than $20 , *num* in the early 1980s .
the cost of digital synthesizers began falling rapidly in the early 1980s .
e-mu systems introduced the emulator sampling synthesizer in *num* at a retail price of $7 , *num* .
although not as flexible or powerful as either the fairlight cmi or the synclavier , its lower cost and portability made it popular .
introduced in *num* , the yamaha dx7 was the breakthrough digital synthesizer to have a major impact , both innovative and affordable , and thus spelling the decline of analog synthesizers .
it used fm synthesis and , although it was incapable of the sampling synthesis of the fairlight cmi , its price was around $2 , *num* , putting it within range of a much larger number of musicians .
the dx-7 was also known for its " key scaling " method to avoid distortion and for its recognizabley bright tonality that was partly due to its high sampling rate of *num* khz .
it became indispensable to many music artists of the 1980s , and would become one of the best-selling synthesizers of all time .
in *num* , roland released its own influential synthesizer of the time , the d-50 .
this popular synth broke new ground in affordably combining short samples and digital oscillators , as well as the innovation of built-in digital effects ( reverb .
, chorus , equalizer ) .
roland called this linear arithmetic ( la ) synthesis .
this instrument is responsible for some of the very recognisable preset synthesizer sounds of the late 1980s , such as the pizzagogo sound used on enya's " orinoco flow .
" it gradually became feasible to include high quality samples of existing instruments as opposed to synthesizing them .
in *num* , korg introduced the last of the hugely popular trio of digital synthesizers of the 1980s after the dx7 and d50 , the m1 .
this heralded both the increasing popularisation of digital sample-based synthesis , and the rise of ' workstation ' synthesizers .
after this time , many popular modern digital synthesizers have been described as not being full synthesizers in the most precise sense , as they play back samples stored in their memory .
however , they still include options to shape the sounds through use of envelopes , lfos , filters and effects such as reverb .
the yamaha motif and roland fantom series of keyboards are typical examples of this type , described as ' romplers ' ; at the same time , they are also examples of " workstation " synthesizers .
with the addition of sophisticated sequencers on board , now added to built-in effects and other features , the ' workstation ' synthesizer had been born .
these always include a multi-track sequencer , and can often record and playback samples , and in later years full audio tracks , to be used to record an entire song .
these are usually also romplers , playing back samples , to give a wide variety of realistic instrument and other sounds such as drums , string instruments and wind instruments to sequence and compose songs , along with popular keyboard instrument sounds such as electric pianos and organs .
as there was still interest in analog synthesizers , and with the increase of computing power , over the 1990s another type of synthesizer arose : the analog modeling , or " virtual analog " synthesizer .
these use computing power to simulate traditional analog waveforms and circuitry such as envelopes and filters , with the most popular examples of this type of instrument including the nord lead and access virus .
as the cost of processing power and memory fell , new types of synthesizers emerged , offering a variety of novel sound synthesis options .
the korg oasys was one such example , packaging multiple digital synthesizers into a single unit .
digital synthesizers can now be completely emulated in software ( " softsynth " ) , and run on conventional pc hardware .
such soft implementations require careful programming and a fast cpu to get the same latency response as their dedicated equivalents .
to reduce latency , some professional sound card manufacturers have developed specialized digital signal processing ( [ dsp ] ) hardware .
dedicated digital synthesizers have the advantage of a performance-friendly user interface ( physical controls like buttons for selecting features and enabling functionality , and knobs for setting variable parameters ) .
on the other hand , software synthesizers have the advantages afforded by a rich graphical display .
with focus on performance-oriented keyboards and digital computer technology , manufacturers of commercial electronic instruments created some of the earliest digital synthesizers for studio and experimental use with computers being able to handle built-in sound synthesis algorithms .
the main difference is that a digital synthesizer uses digital processors and analog synthesizers use analog circuitry .
a digital synthesizer is in essence a computer with ( often ) a piano-keyboard and an lcd as an interface .
an analog synthesizer is made up of sound-generating circuitry and modulators .
because computer technology is rapidly advancing , it is often possible to offer more features in a digital synthesizer than in an analog synthesizer at a given price .
however , both technologies have their own merit .
some forms of synthesis , such as , for instance , sampling and additive synthesis are not feasible in analog synthesizers , while on the other hand , many musicians prefer the character of analog synthesizers over their digital equivalent .
the new wave era of the 1980s first brought the digital synthesizer to the public ear .
bands like talking heads and duran duran used the digitally made sounds on some of their most popular albums .
other more pop-inspired bands like hall & oates began incorporating the digital synthesizer into their sound in the 1980s .
through breakthroughs in technology in the 1990s many modern synthesizers use dsp .
working in more or less the same way , every digital synthesizer appears similar to a computer .
at a steady sample rate , digital synthesis produces a stream of numbers .
sound from speakers is then produced by a conversion to analog form .
through signal generation , voice and instrument-level processing , a signal flow is created and controlled either by midi capabilities or voice and instrument-level controls .
glossary of french expressions in english around *num* % of english vocabulary is of french origin , most coming from the anglo-norman spoken by the upper classes in england for several hundred years after the norman conquest , before the language settled into what became modern english .
thoroughly english words of french origin , such as " art " , " competition " , " force " , " machine " , " money " , " police " , " publicity " , " role " , " routine " and " table " , are pronounced according to english rules of phonology , rather than french , and are commonly used by english speakers without any consciousness of their french origin .
this article , on the other hand , covers french words and phrases that have entered the english lexicon without ever losing their character as gallicisms : they remain unmistakably " french " to an english speaker .
they are most common in written english , where they retain french diacritics and are usually printed in italics .
in spoken english , at least some attempt is generally made to pronounce them as they would sound in french ; an entirely english pronunciation is regarded as a solecism .
some of them were never " good french " , in the sense of being grammatical , idiomatic french usage .
some others were once normal french but have become very old-fashioned , or have acquired different meanings and connotations in the original language , to the extent that they would not be understood ( either at all , or in the intended sense ) by a native french speaker .

difference engine a difference engine created by charles babbage is an automatic mechanical calculator designed to tabulate polynomial functions .
its name is derived from the method of divided differences , a way to interpolate or tabulate functions by using a small set of polynomial coefficients .
most mathematical functions commonly used by engineers , scientists and navigators , including logarithmic and trigonometric functions , can be approximated by polynomials , so a difference engine can compute many useful tables of numbers .
the historical difficulty in producing error-free tables by teams of mathematicians and human " computers " spurred charles babbage's desire to build a mechanism to automate the process .
the notion of a mechanical calculator for mathematical functions can be traced back to the antikythera mechanism of the *ord* century bc , while early modern examples are attributed to pascal and leibniz in the *ord* century .
in *num* j .
h .
müller , an engineer in the hessian army , devised and built an adding machine and described the basic principles of a difference machine in a book published in *num* ( the first written reference to a difference machine is dated to *num* ) , but he was unable to obtain funding to progress with the idea .
charles babbage began to construct a small difference engine in c .
*num* and had completed it by *num* ( difference engine *num* ) .
he announced his invention on june *num* , *num* , in a paper to the royal astronomical society , entitled " note on the application of machinery to the computation of astronomical and mathematical tables " .
this machine used the decimal number system and was powered by cranking a handle .
the british government was interested , since producing tables was time-consuming and expensive and they hoped the difference engine would make the task more economical .
in *num* , the british government gave babbage £1700 to start work on the project .
although babbage's design was feasible , the metalworking techniques of the era could not economically make parts in the precision and quantity required .
thus the implementation proved to be much more expensive and doubtful of success than the government's initial estimate .
in *num* , babbage and joseph clement produced a small working model ( *num* / *num* of the calculating section of difference engine no .
*num* , which was intended to operate on 20-digit numbers and sixth-order differences ) which operated on 6-digit numbers and second-order differences .
lady byron described seeing the working prototype in *num* : " we both went to see the thinking machine ( for so it seems ) last monday .
it raised several nos .
to the *ord* and *ord* powers , and extracted the root of a quadratic equation .
" work on the larger engine was suspended in *num* .
by the time the government abandoned the project in *num* , babbage had received and spent over £17 , *num* on development , which still fell short of achieving a working engine .
the government valued only the machine's output ( economically produced tables ) , not the development ( at unknown and unpredictable cost to complete ) of the machine itself .
babbage did not , or was unwilling to , recognize that predicament .
meanwhile , babbage's attention had moved on to developing an analytical engine , further undermining the government's confidence in the eventual success of the difference engine .
by improving the concept as an analytical engine , babbage had made the difference engine concept obsolete , and the project to implement it an utter failure in the view of the government .
the incomplete difference engine no .
*num* was put on display to the public at the *num* international exhibition in south kensington , london .
babbage went on to design his much more general analytical engine , but later produced an improved " difference engine no .
*num* " design ( 31-digit numbers and seventh-order differences ) , between *num* and *num* .
babbage was able to take advantage of ideas developed for the analytical engine to make the new difference engine calculate more quickly while using fewer parts .
inspired by babbage's difference engine in *num* , per georg scheutz built several experimental models .
in *num* his son edward proposed to construct a working model in metal , and in *num* finished the calculating part , capable of calculating series with 5-digit numbers and first-order differences , which was later extended to third-order ( *num* ) .
in *num* , after adding the printing part , the model was completed .
in *num* , funded by the government , construction of the larger and improved ( 15-digit numbers and fourth-order differences ) machine began , and finished in *num* .
the machine was demonstrated at the world's fair in paris , *num* and then sold in *num* to the dudley observatory in albany , new york ( delivered in *num* ) .
in *num* british government ordered next scheutz's difference machine , which was built in *num* .
it had the same basic construction as the previous one .
weighed about .
martin wiberg improved scheutz's construction ( c .
*num* , his machine has the same capacity as scheutz's - 15-digit and fourth-order ) but used his device only for producing and publishing printed tables ( interest tables in *num* , and logarithmic tables in *num* ) .
alfred deacon of london in c .
*num* produced a small difference engine ( 20-digit numbers and third-order differences ) .
american george b .
grant started working on his calculating machine in *num* , unaware of the works of babbage and scheutz ( schentz ) .
one year later ( *num* ) he learned about difference engines and proceed to design one himself , describing his construction in *num* .
in *num* the boston thursday club raised a subscription for the construction of a large-scale model , which was built in *num* .
it could be expanded to enhance precision , weighed about .
christel hamann built one machine ( 16-digit numbers and second-order differences ) in *num* for the " tables of bauschinger and peters " ( " logarithmic-trigonometrical tables with eight decimal places " ) , which was first published in leipzig in *num* .
weighed about .
burroughs corporation in about *num* built a machine for nautical almanac office which was used as a difference engine of second-order .
it was later replaced in *num* by a burroughs class *num* ( 13-digit numbers and second-order differences , or 11-digit numbers and [ at least up to ] / fifth-order differences ) .
alexander john thompson about *num* built " integrating and differencing machine " ( 13-digit numbers and fifth-order differences ) for his table of logarithms " logarithmetica britannica " .
this machine was composed of four modified triumphator calculators .
leslie comrie in *num* described how to use the brunsviga-dupla calculating machine as a difference engine of second-order ( 15-digit numbers ) .
he also noted in *num* that national accounting machine class *num* could be used as a difference engine of sixth-order .
during the 1980s , allan g .
bromley , an associate professor at the university of sydney , australia , studied babbage's original drawings for the difference and analytical engines at the science museum library in london .
this work led the science museum to construct a working calculating section of difference engine no .
*num* from *num* to *num* , under doron swade , the then curator of computing .
this was to celebrate the *ord* anniversary of babbage's birth in *num* .
in *num* , the printer which babbage originally designed for the difference engine was also completed .
the conversion of the original design drawings into drawings suitable for engineering manufacturers ' use revealed some minor errors in babbage's design ( possibly introduced as a protection in case the plans were stolen ) , which had to be corrected .
once completed , both the engine and its printer worked flawlessly , and still do .
the difference engine and printer were constructed to tolerances achievable with 19th-century technology , resolving a long-standing debate as to whether babbage's design would actually have worked .
( one of the reasons formerly advanced for the non-completion of babbage's engines had been that engineering methods were insufficiently developed in the victorian era .
) the printer's primary purpose is to produce stereotype plates for use in printing presses , which it does by pressing type into soft plaster to create a flong .
babbage intended that the engine's results be conveyed directly to mass printing , having recognized that many errors in previous tables were not the result of human calculating mistakes but from error in the manual typesetting process .
the printer's paper output is mainly a means of checking the engine's performance .
in addition to funding the construction of the output mechanism for the science museum's difference engine no .
*num* , nathan myhrvold commissioned the construction of a second complete difference engine no .
*num* , which was on exhibit at the computer history museum in mountain view , california from *num* may *num* until *num* january *num* .
it has since been transferred to intellectual ventures in seattle where it is on display just outside the main lobby .
the difference engine consists of a number of columns , numbered from *num* to n .
the machine is able to store one decimal number in each column .
the machine can only add the value of a column " n" + *num* to column " n " to produce the new value of " n " .
column " n " can only store a constant , column *num* displays ( and possibly prints ) the value of the calculation on the current iteration .
the engine is programmed by setting initial values to the columns .
column *num* is set to the value of the polynomial at the start of computation .
column *num* is set to a value derived from the first and higher derivatives of the polynomial at the same value of x .
each of the columns from *num* to " n " is set to a value derived from the formula_1 first and higher derivatives of the polynomial .
in the babbage design , one iteration ( i .
e .
, one full set of addition and carry operations ) happens for each rotation of the main shaft .
odd and even columns alternately perform an addition in one cycle .
the sequence of operations for column formula_2 is thus : steps *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* occur for every odd column , while steps *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* occur for every even column .
while babbage's original design placed the crank directly on the main shaft , it was later realized that the force required to crank the machine would have been too great for a human to handle comfortably .
therefore , the two models that were built incorporate a *num* : *num* reduction gear at the crank , and four revolutions of the crank are required to perform one full cycle .
each iteration creates a new result , and is accomplished in four steps corresponding to four complete turns of the handle shown at the far right in the picture below .
the four steps are : the engine represents negative numbers as ten's complements .
subtraction amounts to addition of a negative number .
this works in the same manner that modern computers perform subtraction , known as two's complement .
the principle of a difference engine is newton's method of divided differences .
if the initial value of a polynomial ( and of its finite differences ) is calculated by some means for some value of x , the difference engine can calculate any number of nearby values , using the method generally known as the method of finite differences .
for example , consider the quadratic polynomial with the goal of tabulating the values " p " ( *num* ) , " p " ( *num* ) , " p " ( *num* ) , " p " ( *num* ) , " p " ( *num* ) , and so forth .
the table below is constructed as follows : the second column contains the values of the polynomial , the third column contains the differences of the two left neighbors in the second column , and the fourth column contains the differences of the two neighbors in the third column : the numbers in the third values-column are constant .
in fact , by starting with any polynomial of degree " n " , the column number " n" + *num* will always be constant .
this is the crucial fact behind the success of the method .
this table was built from left to right , but it is possible to continue building it from right to left down a diagonal in order to compute more values .
to calculate " p " ( *num* ) use the values from the lowest diagonal .
start with the fourth column constant value of *num* and copy it down the column .
then continue the third column by adding *num* to *num* to get *num* .
next continue the second column by taking its previous value , *num* and adding the *num* from the third column .
thus " p " ( *num* ) is *num* + *num* = *num* .
in order to compute " p " ( *num* ) , we iterate the same algorithm on the " p " ( *num* ) values : take *num* from the fourth column , add that to the third column's value *num* to get *num* , then add that to the second column's value *num* to get *num* , which is " p " ( *num* ) .
this process may be continued ad infinitum .
the values of the polynomial are produced without ever having to multiply .
a difference engine only needs to be able to add .
from one loop to the next , it needs to store *num* numbers—in this example ( the last elements in the first and second columns ) .
to tabulate polynomials of degree " n " , one needs sufficient storage to hold " n " numbers .
babbage's difference engine no .
*num* , finally built in *num* , could hold *num* numbers of *num* decimal digits each and could thus tabulate *ord* degree polynomials to that precision .
the best machines from scheutz could store *num* numbers with *num* digits each .
the initial values of columns can be calculated by first manually calculating n consecutive values of the function and by backtracking , i .
e .
calculating the required differences .
col formula_6 gets the value of the function at the start of computation formula_7 .
col formula_8 is the difference between formula_9 and formula_7 .
.
.
if the function to be calculated is a polynomial function , expressed as the initial values can be calculated directly from the constant coefficients " a " , " a " , " a " , .
.
.
, " a " without calculating any data points .
the initial values are thus : many commonly used functions are analytic functions , which can be expressed as power series , for example as a taylor series .
the initial values can be calculated to any degree of accuracy ; if done correctly the engine will give exact results for first n steps .
after that , the engine will only give an approximation of the function .
the taylor series expresses the function as a sum obtained from its derivatives at one point .
for many functions the higher derivatives are trivial to obtain ; for instance , the sine function at *num* has values of *num* or formula_19 for all derivatives .
setting *num* as the start of computation we get the simplified maclaurin series the same method of calculating the initial values from the coefficients can be used as for polynomial functions .
the polynomial constant coefficients will now have the value the problem with the methods described above is that errors will accumulate and the series will tend to diverge from the true function .
a solution which guarantees a constant maximum error is to use curve fitting .
a minimum of " n " values are calculated evenly spaced along the range of the desired calculations .
using a curve fitting technique like gaussian reduction an " *ord* degree polynomial interpolation of the function is found .
with the optimized polynomial , the initial values can be calculated as above .
william gibson and bruce sterling's " the difference engine " is an alternate history novel that looks how society would have progressed had the difference engine worked the way babbage envisioned it .
the story takes places in victorian england where technological advancement is on the rise .
this is due to the effect of the success of babbage's analytical machine .
the convention of steampunk where victorian fashion is combined with the technological elements of the industrial revolution is seen throughout the story due to technology being so advanced in that era .

apollo program the apollo program , also known as project apollo , was the third united states human spaceflight program carried out by the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , which succeeded in landing the first humans on the moon from *num* to *num* .
first conceived during dwight d .
eisenhower's administration as a three-man spacecraft to follow the one-man project mercury which put the first americans in space , apollo was later dedicated to president john f .
kennedy's national goal of " landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth " by the end of the 1960s , which he proposed in an address to congress on may *num* , *num* .
it was the third us human spaceflight program to fly , preceded by the two-man project gemini conceived in *num* to extend spaceflight capability in support of apollo .
kennedy's goal was accomplished on the apollo *num* mission when astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin landed their apollo lunar module ( lm ) on july *num* , *num* , and walked on the lunar surface , while michael collins remained in lunar orbit in the command and service module ( csm ) , and all three landed safely on earth on july *num* .
five subsequent apollo missions also landed astronauts on the moon , the last in december *num* .
in these six spaceflights , twelve men walked on the moon .
apollo ran from *num* to *num* , with the first manned flight in *num* .
it achieved its goal of manned lunar landing , despite the major setback of a *num* apollo *num* cabin fire that killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test .
after the first landing , sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunar geological and astrophysical exploration .
budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these .
five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings , but the apollo *num* landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the moon , which destroyed the service module's capability to provide electrical power , crippling the csm's propulsion and life support systems .
the crew returned to earth safely by using the lunar module as a " lifeboat " for these functions .
apollo used saturn family rockets as launch vehicles , which were also used for an apollo applications program , which consisted of skylab , a space station that supported three manned missions in 1973–74 , and the apollo–soyuz test project , a joint us-soviet union earth-orbit mission in *num* .
apollo set several major human spaceflight milestones .
it stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low earth orbit .
apollo *num* was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body , while the final apollo *num* mission marked the sixth moon landing and the ninth manned mission beyond low earth orbit .
the program returned of lunar rocks and soil to earth , greatly contributing to the understanding of the moon's composition and geological history .
the program laid the foundation for nasa's subsequent human spaceflight capability and funded construction of its johnson space center and kennedy space center .
apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and manned spaceflight , including avionics , telecommunications , and computers .
the apollo program was conceived during the eisenhower administration in early *num* , as a follow-up to project mercury .
while the mercury capsule could only support one astronaut on a limited earth orbital mission , apollo would carry three astronauts .
possible missions included ferrying crews to a space station , circumlunar flights , and eventual manned lunar landings .
the program was named after apollo , the greek god of light , music , and the sun , by nasa manager abe silverstein , who later said that " i was naming the spacecraft like i'd name my baby .
" silverstein chose the name at home one evening , early in *num* , because he felt " apollo riding his chariot across the sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program .
" in july *num* , nasa deputy administrator hugh l .
dryden announced the apollo program to industry representatives at a series of space task group conferences .
preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with a " mission module " cabin separate from the " command module " ( piloting and reentry cabin ) , and a " propulsion and equipment module " .
on august *num* , a feasibility study competition was announced , and on october *num* , three study contracts were awarded to general dynamics / convair , general electric , and the glenn l .
martin company .
meanwhile , nasa performed its own in-house spacecraft design studies led by maxime faget , to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs .
in november *num* , john f .
kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised american superiority over the soviet union in the fields of space exploration and missile defense .
up to the election of *num* , kennedy had been speaking out against the " missile gap " that he and many other senators felt had developed between the soviet union and united states due to the inaction of president eisenhower .
beyond military power , kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige , pledging to make the us not " first but , first and , first if , but first period .
" despite kennedy's rhetoric , he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the apollo program once he became president .
he knew little about the technical details of the space program , and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned moon landing .
when kennedy's newly appointed nasa administrator james e .
webb requested a *num* percent budget increase for his agency , kennedy supported an acceleration of nasa's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue .
on april *num* , *num* , soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person to fly in space , reinforcing american fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the soviet union .
at a meeting of the us house committee on science and astronautics one day after gagarin's flight , many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that america would catch up .
kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news , refusing to make a commitment on america's response to the soviets .
on april *num* , kennedy sent a memo to vice president lyndon b .
johnson , asking johnson to look into the status of america's space program , and into programs that could offer nasa the opportunity to catch up .
johnson responded approximately one week later , concluding that " we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership .
" his memo concluded that a manned moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the united states would achieve it first .
on may *num* , *num* , twenty days after the first us manned spaceflight " freedom *num* " , kennedy proposed the manned moon landing in a " special message to the congress on urgent national needs " : now it is time to take longer strides - time for a great new american enterprise - time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement , which in many ways may hold the key to our future on earth .
.
.
.
i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal , before this decade is out , of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth .
no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind , or more important in the long-range exploration of space ; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish .
at the time of kennedy's proposal , only one american had flown in space—less than a month earlier—and nasa had not yet sent an astronaut into orbit .
even some nasa employees doubted whether kennedy's ambitious goal could be met .
by *num* , kennedy even came close to agreeing to a joint us-ussr moon mission , to eliminate duplication of effort .
with the clear goal of a manned landing replacing the more nebulous goals of space stations and circumlunar flights , nasa decided that , in order to make progress quickly , it would discard the feasibility study designs of convair , ge , and martin , and proceed with faget's command and service module design .
the mission module was determined to be only useful as an extra room , and therefore deemed unnecessary .
they used faget's design as the specification for another competition for spacecraft procurement bids in october *num* .
on november *num* , *num* , it was announced that north american aviation had won the contract , although its bid was not rated as good as martin's .
webb , dryden and robert seamans chose it in preference due to north american's longer association with nasa and its predecessor .
landing men on the moon by the end of *num* required the most sudden burst of technological creativity , and the largest commitment of resources ( $25 billion ; $ in dollars ) ever made by any nation in peacetime .
at its peak , the apollo program employed *num* , *num* people and required the support of over *num* , *num* industrial firms and universities .
on july *num* , *num* , nasa established the marshall space flight center ( msfc ) in huntsville , alabama .
msfc designed the heavy lift-class saturn launch vehicles , which would be required for apollo .
it became clear that managing the apollo program would exceed the capabilities of robert r .
gilruth's space task group , which had been directing the nation's manned space program from nasa's langley research center .
so gilruth was given authority to grow his organization into a new nasa center , the manned spacecraft center ( msc ) .
a site was chosen in houston , texas , on land donated by rice university , and administrator webb announced the conversion on september *num* , *num* .
it was also clear nasa would soon outgrow its practice of controlling missions from its cape canaveral air force station launch facilities in florida , so a new mission control center would be included in the msc .
in september *num* , by which time two project mercury astronauts had orbited the earth , gilruth had moved his organization to rented space in houston , and construction of the msc facility was under way , kennedy visited rice to reiterate his challenge in a famous speech : the msc was completed in september *num* .
it was renamed by the us congress in honor of lyndon johnson soon after his death in *num* .
it also became clear that apollo would outgrow the canaveral launch facilities in florida .
the two newest launch complexes were already being built for the saturn i and ib rockets at the northernmost end : lc-34 and lc-37 .
but an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the manned lunar mission , so land acquisition was started in july *num* for a launch operations center ( loc ) immediately north of canaveral at merritt island .
the design , development and construction of the center was conducted by kurt h .
debus , a member of dr .
wernher von braun's original v-2 rocket engineering team .
debus was named the loc's first director .
construction began in november *num* .
upon kennedy's death , president johnson issued an executive order on november *num* , *num* , to rename the loc and cape canaveral in honor of kennedy .
the loc included launch complex *num* , a launch control center , and a *num* million cubic foot ( *num* .
*num* million cubic meter ) vertical assembly building ( vab ) in which the space vehicle ( launch vehicle and spacecraft ) would be assembled on a mobile launcher platform and then moved by a transporter to one of several launch pads .
although at least three pads were planned , only two , designated a and b , were completed in october *num* .
the loc also included an operations and checkout building ( ocb ) to which gemini and apollo spacecraft were initially received prior to being mated to their launch vehicles .
the apollo spacecraft could be tested in two vacuum chambers capable of simulating atmospheric pressure at altitudes up to , which is nearly a vacuum .
administrator webb realized that in order to keep apollo costs under control , he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization , so he recruited dr .
george e .
mueller for a high management job .
mueller accepted , on the condition that he have a say in nasa reorganization necessary to effectively administer apollo .
webb then worked with associate administrator ( later deputy administrator ) seamans to reorganize the office of manned space flight ( omsf ) .
on july *num* , *num* , webb announced mueller's appointment as deputy associate administrator for manned space flight , to replace then associate administrator d .
brainerd holmes on his retirement effective september *num* .
under webb's reorganization , the directors of the manned spacecraft center ( gilruth ) , marshall space flight center ( von braun ) , and the launch operations center ( debus ) reported to mueller .
based on his industry experience on air force missile projects , mueller realized some skilled managers could be found among high-ranking officers in the united states air force , so he got webb's permission to recruit general samuel c .
phillips , who gained a reputation for his effective management of the minuteman program , as omsf program controller .
phillips ' superior officer bernard a .
schriever agreed to loan phillips to nasa , along with a staff of officers under him , on the condition that phillips be made apollo program director .
mueller agreed , and phillips managed apollo from january *num* , until it achieved the first manned landing in july *num* , after which he returned to air force duty .
once kennedy had defined a goal , the apollo mission planners were faced with the challenge of designing a spacecraft that could meet it while minimizing risk to human life , cost , and demands on technology and astronaut skill .
four possible mission modes were considered : in early *num* , direct ascent was generally the mission mode in favor at nasa .
many engineers feared that a rendezvous—let alone a docking—neither of which had been attempted even in earth orbit , would be extremely difficult in lunar orbit .
dissenters including john houbolt at langley research center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the lor approach .
throughout *num* and *num* , houbolt campaigned for the recognition of lor as a viable and practical option .
bypassing the nasa hierarchy , he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to associate administrator robert seamans ; while acknowledging that he spoke " somewhat as a voice in the wilderness , " houbolt pleaded that lor should not be discounted in studies of the question .
seamans ' establishment of an ad-hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant nicholas e .
golovin in july *num* , to recommend a launch vehicle to be used in the apollo program , represented a turning point in nasa's mission mode decision .
this committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice , and recommended in favor of a hybrid eor-lor mode .
its consideration of lor—as well as houbolt's ceaseless work—played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach .
in late *num* and early *num* , members of the manned spacecraft center began to come around to support lor , including the newly hired deputy director of the office of manned space flight , joseph shea , who became a champion of lor .
the engineers at marshall space flight center ( msfc ) , which had much to lose from the decision , took longer to become convinced of its merits , but their conversion was announced by wernher von braun at a briefing on june *num* , *num* .
but even after nasa reached internal agreement , it was far from smooth sailing .
kennedy's science advisor jerome wiesner , who had expressed his opposition to manned spaceflight to kennedy before the president took office , and had opposed the decision to land men on the moon , hired golovin , who had left nasa , to chair his own " space vehicle panel " , ostensibly to monitor , but actually to second-guess nasa's decisions on the saturn v launch vehicle and lor by forcing shea , seamans , and even webb to defend themselves , delaying its formal announcement to the press on july *num* , *num* , and forcing webb to still hedge the decision as " tentative " .
wiesner kept up the pressure , even making the disagreement public during a two-day september visit by the president to marshall space flight center .
wiesner blurted out " no , that's no good " in front of the press , during a presentation by von braun .
webb jumped in and defended von braun , until kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was " still subject to final review " .
webb held firm , and issued a request for proposal to candidate lunar excursion module ( lem ) contractors .
wiesner finally relented , unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in kennedy's office , because of the president's involvement with the october cuban missile crisis , and fear of kennedy's support for webb .
nasa announced the selection of grumman as the lem contractor in november *num* .
space historian james hansen concludes that : the lor method had the advantage of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a " lifeboat " in the event of a failure of the command ship .
some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen .
in *num* an msc study concluded , " the lm [ as lifeboat ] .
.
.
was finally dropped , because no single reasonable csm failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the sps .
" ironically , just such a failure happened on apollo *num* when an oxygen tank explosion left the csm without electrical power .
the lunar module provided propulsion , electrical power and life support to get the crew home safely .
faget's preliminary apollo design employed a cone-shaped command module , supported by one of several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power , sized appropriately for the space station , cislunar , and lunar landing missions .
once kennedy's moon landing goal became official , detailed design began of a " command and service module " ( csm ) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip , after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module .
the final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the csm's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew , along with a new spacecraft , the " lunar excursion module " ( lem , later shortened to " lunar module " , lm ) which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the csm .
the command module ( cm ) was the conical crew cabin , designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an earth ocean landing .
it was the only component of the apollo spacecraft to survive without major configuration changes as the program evolved from the early apollo study designs .
its exterior was covered with an ablative heat shield , and had its own reaction control system ( rcs ) engines to control its attitude and steer its atmospheric entry path .
parachutes were carried to slow its descent to splashdown .
the module was tall , in diameter , and weighed approximately .
a cylindrical service module ( sm ) supported the command module , with a service propulsion engine and an rcs with propellants , and a fuel cell power generation system with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen reactants .
a high-gain s-band antenna was used for long-distance communications on the lunar flights .
on the extended lunar missions , an orbital scientific instrument package was carried .
the service module was discarded just before reentry .
the module was long and in diameter .
the initial lunar flight version weighed approximately fully fueled , while a later version designed to carry a lunar orbit scientific instrument package weighed just over .
north american aviation won the contract to build the csm , and also the second stage of the saturn v launch vehicle for nasa .
because the csm design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous , the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the csm off the moon , and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight .
also , there was no provision for docking with the lunar module .
a *num* program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as block i which would be used for early testing , while block ii , the actual lunar spacecraft , would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in block i development .
the apollo lunar module ( lm ) was designed to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the command module .
not designed to fly through the earth's atmosphere or return to earth , its fuselage was designed totally without aerodynamic considerations , and was of an extremely lightweight construction .
it consisted of separate descent and ascent stages , each with its own engine .
the descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant , surface stay consumables , and surface exploration equipment .
the ascent stage contained the crew cabin , ascent propellant , and a reaction control system .
the initial lm model weighed approximately , and allowed surface stays up to around *num* hours .
an extended lunar module weighed over , and allowed surface stays of over *num* days .
the contract for design and construction of the lunar module was awarded to grumman aircraft engineering corporation , and the project was overseen by thomas j .
kelly .
before the apollo program began , wernher von braun and his team of rocket engineers had started work on plans for very large launch vehicles , the saturn series , and the even larger nova series .
in the midst of these plans , von braun was transferred from the army to nasa , and made director of the marshall space flight center .
the initial direct ascent plan to send the three-man apollo command and service module directly to the lunar surface , on top of a large descent rocket stage , would require a nova-class launcher , with a lunar payload capability of over .
the june *num* , *num* , decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous enabled the saturn v to replace the nova , and the msfc proceeded to develop the saturn rocket family for apollo .
since apollo , like mercury , would require a launch escape system ( les ) in case of a launch failure , a relatively small rocket was required for qualification flight testing of this system .
a size bigger than the naa little joe would be required , so the little joe ii was built by general dynamics / convair .
after an august *num* qualification test flight , four les test flights ( a-001 through *num* ) were made at the white sands missile range between may *num* and january *num* .
since apollo , like mercury , used more than one launch vehicle for space missions , nasa used spacecraft-launch vehicle combination series numbers : as-10x for saturn i , as-20x for saturn ib , and as-50x for saturn v ( compare mercury-redstone *num* , mercury-atlas *num* ) to designate and plan all missions , rather than numbering them sequentially as in project gemini .
this was changed by the time manned flights began .
saturn i , the first us heavy lift launch vehicle , was initially planned to launch partially equipped csms in low earth orbit tests .
the s-i first stage burned rp-1 with liquid oxygen ( lox ) oxidizer in eight clustered rocketdyne h-1 engines , to produce of thrust .
the s-iv second stage used six liquid hydrogen-fueled pratt & whitney rl-10 engines with of thrust .
a planned centaur ( s-v ) third stage with two rl-10 engines never flew on saturn i .
the first four saturn i test flights were launched from lc-34 , with only live first stages , carrying dummy upper stages filled with water .
the first flight with a live s-iv was launched from lc-37 .
this was followed by five launches of boilerplate csms ( designated as-101 through as-105 ) into orbit in *num* and *num* .
the last three of these further supported the apollo program by also carrying pegasus satellites , which verified the safety of the translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of micrometeorite impacts .
in september *num* , nasa planned to launch four manned csm flights on the saturn i from late *num* through *num* , concurrent with project gemini .
the payload capacity would have severely limited the systems which could be included , so the decision was made in october *num* to use the uprated saturn ib for all manned earth orbital flights .
the saturn ib was an upgraded version of the saturn i .
the s-ib first stage increased the thrust to by uprating the h-1 engine .
the second stage replaced the s-iv with the s-ivb-200 , powered by a single j-2 engine burning liquid hydrogen fuel with lox , to produce of thrust .
a restartable version of the s-ivb was used as the third stage of the saturn v .
the saturn ib could send over into low earth orbit , sufficient for a partially fueled csm or the lm .
saturn ib launch vehicles and flights were designated with an as-200 series number , " as " indicating " apollo saturn " and the " *num* " indicating the second member of the saturn rocket family .
saturn v launch vehicles and flights were designated with an as-500 series number , " as " indicating " apollo saturn " and the " *num* " indicating saturn v .
the three-stage saturn v was designed to send a fully fueled csm and lm to the moon .
it was in diameter and stood tall with its lunar payload .
its capability grew to for the later advanced lunar landings .
the s-ic first stage burned rp-1 / lox for a rated thrust of , which was upgraded to .
the second and third stages burned liquid hydrogen , and the third stage was a modified version of the s-ivb , with thrust increased to and capability to restart the engine for translunar injection after reaching a parking orbit .
nasa's director of flight crew operations during the apollo program was donald k .
" deke " slayton , one of the original mercury seven astronauts who was medically grounded in september *num* due to a heart murmur .
slayton was responsible for making all gemini and apollo crew assignments .
thirty-two astronauts were assigned to fly missions in the apollo program .
twenty-four of these left earth's orbit and flew around the moon between december *num* and december *num* ( three of them twice ) .
half of the *num* walked on the moon's surface , though none of them returned to it after landing once .
one of the moonwalkers was a trained geologist .
of the *num* , gus grissom , ed white , and roger chaffee were killed during a ground test in preparation for the apollo *num* mission .
the apollo astronauts were chosen from the project mercury and gemini veterans , plus from two later astronaut groups .
all missions were commanded by gemini or mercury veterans .
crews on all development flights ( except the earth orbit csm development flights ) through the first two landings on apollo *num* and apollo *num* , included at least two ( sometimes three ) gemini veterans .
dr .
harrison schmitt , a geologist , was the first nasa scientist astronaut to fly in space , and landed on the moon on the last mission , apollo *num* .
schmitt participated in the lunar geology training of all of the apollo landing crews .
nasa awarded all *num* of these astronauts its highest honor , the distinguished service medal , given for " distinguished service , ability , or courage " , and personal " contribution representing substantial progress to the nasa mission " .
the medals were awarded posthumously to grissom , white , and chaffee in *num* , then to the crews of all missions from apollo *num* onward .
the crew that flew the first earth orbital test mission apollo *num* , walter m .
schirra , donn eisele , and walter cunningham , were awarded the lesser nasa exceptional service medal , because of discipline problems with the flight director's orders during their flight .
the nasa administrator in october , *num* , decided to award them the distinguished service medals , by this time posthumously to schirra and eisele .
the nominal planned lunar landing mission proceeded as follows : two block i csms were launched from lc-34 on suborbital flights in *num* with the saturn ib .
the first , as-201 launched on february *num* , reached an altitude of and splashed down downrange in the atlantic ocean .
the second , as-202 on august *num* , reached altitude and was recovered downrange in the pacific ocean .
these flights validated the service module engine and the command module heat shield .
a third saturn ib test , as-203 launched from pad *num* , went into orbit to support design of the s-ivb upper stage restart capability needed for the saturn v .
it carried a nosecone instead of the apollo spacecraft , and its payload was the unburned liquid hydrogen fuel , the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors , and a tv camera .
this flight occurred on july *num* , before as-202 , which was delayed because of problems getting the apollo spacecraft ready for flight .
two manned orbital block i csm missions were planned : as-204 and as-205 .
the block i crew positions were titled command pilot , senior pilot , and pilot .
the senior pilot would assume navigation duties , while the pilot would function as a systems engineer .
the astronauts would wear a modified version of the gemini spacesuit .
after an unmanned lm test flight as-206 , a crew would fly the first block ii csm and lm in a dual mission known as as-207 / *num* , or as-278 ( each spacecraft would be launched on a separate saturn ib ) .
the block ii crew positions were titled commander , command module pilot , and lunar module pilot .
the astronauts would begin wearing a new apollo a6l spacesuit , designed to accommodate lunar extravehicular activity ( eva ) .
the traditional visor helmet was replaced with a clear " fishbowl " type for greater visibility , and the lunar surface eva suit would include a water-cooled undergarment .
deke slayton , the grounded mercury astronaut who became director of flight crew operations for the gemini and apollo programs , selected the first apollo crew in january *num* , with grissom as command pilot , white as senior pilot , and rookie donn f .
eisele as pilot .
but eisele dislocated his shoulder twice aboard the kc135 weightlessness training aircraft , and had to undergo surgery on january *num* .
slayton replaced him with chaffee .
nasa announced the final crew selection for as-204 on march *num* , *num* , with the backup crew consisting of gemini veterans james mcdivitt and david scott , with rookie russell l .
" rusty " schweickart .
mercury / gemini veteran wally schirra , eisele , and rookie walter cunningham were announced on september *num* as the prime crew for as-205 .
in december *num* , the as-205 mission was canceled , since the validation of the csm would be accomplished on the 14-day first flight , and as-205 would have been devoted to space experiments and contribute no new engineering knowledge about the spacecraft .
its saturn ib was allocated to the dual mission , now redesignated as-205 / *num* or as-258 , planned for august *num* .
mcdivitt , scott and schweickart were promoted to the prime as-258 crew , and schirra , eisele and cunningham were reassigned as the apollo *num* backup crew .
the spacecraft for the as-202 and as-204 missions were delivered by north american aviation to the kennedy space center with long lists of equipment problems which had to be corrected before flight ; these delays caused the launch of as-202 to slip behind as-203 , and eliminated hopes the first manned mission might be ready to launch as soon as november *num* , concurrently with the last gemini mission .
eventually the planned as-204 flight date was pushed to february *num* , *num* .
north american aviation was prime contractor not only for the apollo csm , but for the saturn v s-ii second stage as well , and delays in this stage pushed the first unmanned saturn v flight as-501 from late *num* to november *num* .
( the initial assembly of as-501 had to use a dummy spacer spool in place of the stage .
) the problems with north american were severe enough in late *num* to cause manned space flight administrator george mueller to appoint program director samuel phillips to head a " tiger team " to investigate north american's problems and identify corrections .
phillips documented his findings in a december *num* letter to naa president lee atwood , with a strongly worded letter by mueller , and also gave a presentation of the results to mueller and deputy administrator robert seamans .
meanwhile , grumman was also encountering problems with the lunar module , eliminating hopes it would be ready for manned flight in *num* , not long after the first manned csm flights .
grissom , white , and chaffee decided to name their flight apollo *num* as a motivational focus on the first manned flight .
they trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at north american , and in the altitude chamber at the kennedy space center .
a " plugs-out " test was planned for january , which would simulate a launch countdown on lc-34 with the spacecraft transferring from pad-supplied to internal power .
if successful , this would be followed by a more rigorous countdown simulation test closer to the february *num* launch , with both spacecraft and launch vehicle fueled .
the plugs-out test began on the morning of january *num* , *num* , and immediately was plagued with problems .
first the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits , which delayed the sealing of the hatch .
then , communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown .
during this hold , an electrical fire began in the cabin , and spread quickly in the high pressure , *num* % oxygen atmosphere .
pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin inner wall burst , allowing the fire to erupt onto the pad area and frustrating attempts to rescue the crew .
the astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened .
nasa immediately convened an accident review board , overseen by both houses of congress .
while the determination of responsibility for the accident was complex , the review board concluded that " deficiencies existed in command module design , workmanship and quality control .
" at the insistence of nasa administrator webb , north american removed harrison storms as command module program manager .
webb also reassigned apollo spacecraft program office ( aspo ) manager joseph francis shea , replacing him with george low .
to remedy the causes of the fire , changes were made in the block ii spacecraft and operational procedures , the most important of which were use of a nitrogen / oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch , and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials .
the block ii design already called for replacement of the block i plug-type hatch cover with a quick-release , outward opening door .
nasa discontinued the manned block i program , using the block i spacecraft only for unmanned saturn v flights .
crew members would also exclusively wear modified , fire-resistant a7l block ii space suits , and would be designated by the block ii titles , regardless of whether a lm was present on the flight or not .
on april *num* , *num* , mueller published an official apollo mission numbering scheme , using sequential numbers for all flights , manned or unmanned .
the sequence would start with apollo *num* to cover the first three unmanned flights while retiring the apollo *num* designation to honor the crew , per their widows ' wishes .
in september *num* , mueller approved a sequence of mission types which had to be successfully accomplished in order to achieve the manned lunar landing .
each step had to be successfully accomplished before the next ones could be performed , and it was unknown how many tries of each mission would be necessary ; therefore letters were used instead of numbers .
the a missions were unmanned saturn v validation ; b was unmanned lm validation using the saturn ib ; c was manned csm earth orbit validation using the saturn ib ; d was the first manned csm / lm flight ( this replaced as-258 , using a single saturn v launch ) ; e would be a higher earth orbit csm / lm flight ; f would be the first lunar mission , testing the lm in lunar orbit but without landing ( a " dress rehearsal " ) ; and g would be the first manned landing .
the list of types covered follow-on lunar exploration to include h lunar landings , i for lunar orbital survey missions , and j for extended-stay lunar landings .
the delay in the csm caused by the fire enabled nasa to catch up on man-rating the lm and saturn v .
apollo *num* ( as-501 ) was the first unmanned flight of the saturn v , carrying a block i csm on november *num* , *num* .
the capability of the command module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the service module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual earth-orbital reentry speed .
apollo *num* ( as-204 ) was the first unmanned test flight of lm in earth orbit , launched from pad *num* on january *num* , *num* , by the saturn ib that would have been used for apollo *num* .
the lm engines were successfully test-fired and restarted , despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing .
the ascent engine was fired in abort mode , known as a " fire-in-the-hole " test , where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage .
although grumman wanted a second unmanned test , george low decided the next lm flight would be manned .
this was followed on april *num* , *num* , by apollo *num* ( as-502 ) which carried a csm and a lm test article as ballast .
the intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection , followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort , using the service module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry .
the saturn v experienced pogo oscillation , a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion , which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages .
two s-ii engines shut down prematurely , but the remaining engines were able to compensate .
the damage to the third stage engine was more severe , preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection .
mission controllers were able to use the service module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of apollo *num* .
based on the good performance of apollo *num* and identification of satisfactory fixes to the apollo *num* problems , nasa declared the saturn v ready to fly men , cancelling a third unmanned test .
apollo *num* , launched from lc-34 on october *num* , *num* , was the c mission , crewed by schirra , eisele and cunningham .
it was an 11-day earth-orbital flight which tested the csm systems .
apollo *num* was planned to be the d mission in december *num* , crewed by mcdivitt , scott and schweickart , launched on a saturn v instead of two saturn ibs .
in the summer it had become clear that the lm would not be ready in time .
rather than waste the saturn v on another simple earth-orbiting mission , aspo manager george low suggested the bold step of sending apollo *num* to orbit the moon instead , deferring the d mission to the next mission in march *num* , and eliminating the e mission .
this would keep the program on track .
the soviet union had sent two tortoises , mealworms , wine flies , and other lifeforms around the moon on september *num* , *num* , aboard zond *num* , and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts .
the decision was not announced publicly until successful completion of apollo *num* .
gemini veterans frank borman and jim lovell , and rookie william anders captured the world's attention by making ten lunar orbits in *num* hours , transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on christmas eve , and returning safely to earth .
the following march , lm flight , rendezvous and docking were successfully demonstrated in earth orbit on apollo *num* , and schweickart tested the full lunar eva suit with its portable life support system ( plss ) outside the lm .
the f mission was successfully carried out on apollo *num* in may *num* by gemini veterans thomas p .
stafford , john young and eugene cernan .
stafford and cernan took the lm to within of the lunar surface .
the g mission was achieved on apollo *num* in july *num* by an all-gemini veteran crew consisting of neil armstrong , michael collins and buzz aldrin .
armstrong and aldrin performed the first landing at the sea of tranquility at *num* : *num* : *num* utc on july *num* , *num* .
they spent a total of *num* hours , *num* minutes on the surface , and spent *num* hours , *num* minutes outside the spacecraft , walking on the surface , taking photographs , collecting material samples , and deploying automated scientific instruments , while continuously sending black-and-white television back to earth .
the astronauts returned safely on july *num* .
in november *num* , gemini veteran charles " pete " conrad and rookie alan l .
bean made a precision landing on apollo *num* within walking distance of the surveyor *num* unmanned lunar probe , which had landed in april *num* on the ocean of storms .
the command module pilot was gemini veteran richard f .
gordon jr .
conrad and bean carried the first lunar surface color television camera , but it was damaged when accidentally pointed into the sun .
they made two evas totaling *num* hours and *num* minutes .
on one , they walked to the surveyor , photographed it , and removed some parts which they returned to earth .
the success of the first two landings allowed the remaining missions to be crewed with a single veteran as commander , with two rookies .
apollo *num* launched lovell , jack swigert , and fred haise in april *num* , headed for the fra mauro formation .
but two days out , a liquid oxygen tank exploded , disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the lm as a " life boat " to return to earth .
another nasa review board was convened to determine the cause , which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory , and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications .
apollo was grounded again , for the remainder of *num* while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added .
the contracted batch of *num* saturn vs were enough for lunar landing missions through apollo *num* .
nasa publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites , with plans to increase the mass of the csm and lm for the last five missions , along with the payload capacity of the saturn v .
these final missions would combine the i and j types in the *num* list , allowing the cmp to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface , and allowing them to stay on the moon for over three days .
these missions would also carry the lunar roving vehicle ( lrv ) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the lm .
also , the block ii spacesuit was revised for the extended missions to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the lrv .
about the time of the first landing in *num* , it was decided to use an existing saturn v to launch the skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground , replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several saturn ib launches ; this eliminated apollo *num* .
nasa's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing , and nasa also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming space shuttle .
by *num* , the decision was made to also cancel missions *num* and *num* .
the two unused saturn vs became museum exhibits at the john f .
kennedy space center on merritt island , florida , george c .
marshall space center in huntsville , alabama , michoud assembly facility in new orleans , louisiana , and lyndon b .
johnson space center in houston , texas .
the cutbacks forced mission planners to reassess the original planned landing sites in order to achieve the most effective geological sample and data collection from the remaining four missions .
apollo *num* had been planned to be the last of the h series missions , but since there would be only two subsequent missions left , it was changed to the first of three j missions .
apollo 13's fra mauro mission was reassigned to apollo *num* , commanded in february *num* by mercury veteran alan shepard , with stuart roosa and edgar mitchell .
this time the mission was successful .
shepard and mitchell spent *num* hours and *num* minutes on the surface , and completed two evas totalling *num* hours *num* minutes , which was a record for the longest eva by a lunar crew at the time .
in august *num* , just after conclusion of the apollo *num* mission , president richard nixon proposed canceling the two remaining lunar landing missions , apollo *num* and *num* .
office of management and budget deputy director caspar weinberger was opposed to this , and persuaded nixon to keep the remaining missions .
apollo *num* was launched on july *num* , *num* , with david scott , alfred worden and james irwin .
scott and irwin landed on july *num* near hadley rille , and spent just under two days , *num* hours on the surface .
in over *num* hours of eva , they collected about of lunar material .
apollo *num* landed in the descartes highlands on april *num* , *num* .
the crew was commanded by john young , with ken mattingly and charles duke .
young and duke spent just under three days on the surface , with a total of over *num* hours eva .
apollo *num* was the last of the apollo program , landing in the taurus–littrow region in december *num* .
eugene cernan commanded ronald e .
evans and nasa's first scientist-astronaut , geologist dr .
harrison h .
schmitt .
schmitt was originally scheduled for apollo *num* , but the lunar geological community lobbied for his inclusion on the final lunar landing .
cernan and schmitt stayed on the surface for just over three days and spent just over *num* hours of total eva .
source : " apollo by the numbers : a statistical reference " ( orloff *num* ) the apollo program returned over of lunar rocks and soil to the lunar receiving laboratory in houston .
today , *num* % of the samples are stored at the lunar sample laboratory facility built in *num* .
the rocks collected from the moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on earth , as measured by radiometric dating techniques .
they range in age from about *num* .
*num* billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria , to about *num* .
*num* billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust .
as such , they represent samples from a very early period in the development of the solar system , that are largely absent on earth .
one important rock found during the apollo program is dubbed the genesis rock , retrieved by astronauts david scott and james irwin during the apollo *num* mission .
this anorthosite rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium-rich feldspar mineral anorthite , and is believed to be representative of the highland crust .
a geochemical component called kreep was discovered by apollo *num* , which has no known terrestrial counterpart .
kreep and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the moon was once completely molten ( see lunar magma ocean ) .
almost all the rocks show evidence of impact process effects .
many samples appear to be pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters , which is never seen on earth rocks , due to the thick atmosphere .
many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events .
some of the returned samples are of " impact melt " ( materials melted near an impact crater .
) all samples returned from the moon are highly brecciated as a result of being subjected to multiple impact events .
analysis of composition of the lunar samples supports the giant impact hypothesis , that the moon was created through impact of a large astronomical body with the earth .
when president kennedy first chartered the moon landing program , a preliminary cost estimate of $7 billion was generated , but this proved an extremely unrealistic guess of what could not possibly be determined precisely , and james webb used his judgment as administrator to change the estimate to $20 billion before giving it to vice president johnson .
when kennedy made his *num* speech at rice university , the annual space budget was $5 .
*num* billion , and he described this cost as *num* cents per person per week , " somewhat less than we pay for cigarettes and cigars every year " , but that the moon program would soon raise this to " more than *num* cents a week for every man , woman and child in the united states " .
webb's estimate shocked many at the time ( including the president ) but ultimately proved accurate .
in january *num* , nasa prepared an itemized estimate of the run-out cost of the apollo program .
the total came to $23 .
*num* billion , itemized as follows : the final cost of apollo was reported to congress as $25 .
*num* billion in *num* , it took up the majority of nasa's budget while it was being developed .
for example , in *num* it accounted for about *num* percent of nasa's total $5 .
*num* billion budget .
that was one of the biggest investment of the us in science , research and development , and employed thousands of american scientists .
a single saturn v launch in *num* cost up to $375 million , compared to the national science foundation's fiscal year *num* budget of $440 million .
in *num* , nasa held a symposium on project costs which presented an estimate of the apollo program costs in *num* dollars as roughly $170 billion ( $ in dollars ) .
this included all research and development costs ; the procurement of *num* saturn v rockets , *num* command and service modules , *num* lunar modules , plus program support and management costs ; construction expenses for facilities and their upgrading , and costs for flight operations .
this was based on a congressional budget office report , " a budgetary analysis of nasa's new vision for space " , september *num* .
" the space review " estimated in *num* the cost of apollo from *num* to *num* as $20 .
*num* billion , or $109 billion in *num* dollars .
( $ in dollars ) looking beyond the manned lunar landings , nasa investigated several post-lunar applications for apollo hardware .
the apollo extension series ( " apollo x " , ) proposed up to *num* flights to earth orbit , using the space in the spacecraft lunar module adapter ( sla ) to house a small orbital laboratory ( workshop ) .
astronauts would continue to use the csm as a ferry to the station .
this study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty s-ivb saturn upper stage , and grew into the apollo applications program ( aap ) .
the workshop was to be supplemented by the apollo telescope mount , which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack .
the most ambitious plan called for using an empty s-ivb as an interplanetary spacecraft for a venus fly-by mission .
the s-ivb orbital workshop was the only one of these plans to make it off the drawing board .
dubbed skylab , it was constructed complete on the ground rather than in space , and launched in *num* using the two lower stages of a saturn v .
it was equipped with an apollo telescope mount .
skylab's last crew departed the station on february *num* , *num* , and the station itself reentered the atmosphere in *num* .
the apollo-soyuz test project also used apollo hardware for the first joint nation space flight , paving the way for future cooperation with other nations in the space shuttle and international space station programs .
in september *num* , the x prize foundation and google announced the google lunar x prize , to be awarded for a robotic lunar landing mission which transmits close-up images of the apollo lunar modules and other artificial objects on the surface .
in *num* , japan aerospace exploration agency's selene probe observed evidence of the halo surrounding the apollo *num* lunar module blast crater while orbiting above the lunar surface .
in *num* , nasa's robotic lunar reconnaissance orbiter , while orbiting above the moon , began photographing the remnants of the apollo program left on the lunar surface , and photographed each site where manned apollo flights landed .
all of the u .
s .
flags left on the moon during the apollo missions were found to still be standing , with the exception of the one left during the apollo *num* mission , which was blown over during that mission's lift-off from the lunar surface and return to the mission command module in lunar orbit ; the degree to which these flags retain their original colors remains unknown .
in a november *num* , *num* , editorial , " the new york times " opined : the apollo program has been called the greatest technological achievement in human history .
apollo stimulated many areas of technology , leading to over *num* , *num* spinoff products as of *num* .
the flight computer design used in both the lunar and command modules was , along with the polaris and minuteman missile systems , the driving force behind early research into integrated circuits ( ic ) .
by *num* , apollo was using *num* percent of the united states ' production of ics .
the crucial difference between the requirements of apollo and the missile programs was apollo's much greater need for reliability .
while the navy and air force could work around reliability problems by deploying more missiles , the political and financial cost of failure of an apollo mission was unacceptably high .
the crew of apollo *num* sent the first live televised pictures of the earth and the moon back to earth , and read from the creation story in the book of genesis , on christmas eve *num* .
an estimated one quarter of the population of the world saw—either live or delayed—the christmas eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the moon , and an estimated one fifth of the population of the world watched the live transmission of the apollo *num* moonwalk .
the apollo program also affected environmental activism in the 1970s due to photos taken by the astronauts .
the most famous , taken by the apollo *num* astronauts , is " the blue marble " .
this image , which was released during a surge in environmentalism , became a symbol of the environmental movement , as a depiction of earth's frailty , vulnerability , and isolation amid the vast expanse of space .
according to " the economist " , apollo succeeded in accomplishing president kennedy's goal of taking on the soviet union in the space race , and beat it by accomplishing a singular and significant achievement , to demonstrate the superiority of the free-market system .
the publication noted the irony that in order to achieve the goal , the program required the organization of tremendous public resources within a vast , centralized government bureaucracy .
as part of apollo 11's *ord* anniversary in *num* , nasa spearheaded an effort to digitally restore the existing videotapes of the mission's live televised moonwalk .
after an exhaustive three-year search for missing tapes of the original video of the apollo *num* moonwalk , nasa concluded the data tapes had more than likely been accidentally erased .
the lunar eva video was produced with a special apollo tv camera which scanned the picture in a format incompatible with broadcast tv .
this required conversion for live television broadcast , which due to the state of *num* technology caused some degradation of picture quality .
but the unconverted picture signal was recorded on magnetic telemetry tapes .
in *num* , stanley lebar , who had led the team that designed and built the lunar television camera at westinghouse electric corporation , worked with nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes , with the goal of seeing if more modern technology could produce a broadcast-ready picture closer to the original quality .
however , in the intervening years , a magnetic tape shortage prompted nasa to recall massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the national archives and records administration to be reused to record newer satellite data .
with a budget of $230 , *num* , the surviving original lunar broadcast data from apollo *num* was compiled by nafzger and assigned to lowry digital for restoration .
the video was processed to remove random noise and camera shake without destroying historical legitimacy .
the images were from tapes in australia , the cbs news archive , and kinescope recordings made at johnson space center .
the restored video , remaining in black and white , contains conservative digital enhancements and did not include sound quality improvements .
numerous documentary films cover the apollo program and the space race , including : the apollo program , or certain missions , have been dramatized in " apollo *num* " ( *num* ) , " apollo *num* " ( *num* ) , " from the earth to the moon " ( *num* ) , " the dish " ( *num* ) , " space race " ( *num* ) , " moonshot " ( *num* ) , and " first man " ( *num* ) .
economy of brunei brunei is a country with a small , wealthy economy that is a mixture of foreign and domestic entrepreneurship , government regulation and welfare measures , and village tradition .
it is almost totally supported by exports of crude oil and natural gas , with revenues from the petroleum sector accounting for over half of gdp .
per capita gdp is high , and substantial income from overseas investment supplements income from domestic production .
the government provides for all medical services and subsidizes food and housing .
the government has shown progress in its basic policy of diversifying the economy away from oil and gas .
brunei's leaders are concerned that steadily increased integration in the world economy will undermine internal social cohesion although it has taken steps to become a more prominent player by serving as chairman for the *num* apec ( asian pacific economic cooperation ) forum .
growth in *num* was estimated at *num* .
*num* % due to higher oil prices in the second half .
brunei is the third-largest oil producer in southeast asia , averaging about .
it also is the ninth-largest producer of liquefied natural gas in the world .
this is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of brunei darussalam at market prices estimated by the international monetary fund with figures in millions of bruneian dollars .
for purchasing power parity comparisons , the us dollar is exchanged at *num* .
*num* bruneian dollars only .
mean wages were $25 .
*num* per man-hour in *num* .
the government regulates the immigration of foreign labor out of concern it might disrupt brunei's society .
work permits for foreigners are issued only for short periods and must be continually renewed .
despite these restrictions , foreigners make up a significant portion of the work force .
the government reported a total work force of *num* , *num* in *num* , with an unemployment rate of *num* .
*num* % .
oil and natural gas account for almost all exports .
since only a few products other than petroleum are produced locally , a wide variety of items must be imported .
brunei statistics show singapore as the largest point of origin of imports , accounting for *num* % in *num* .
however , this figure includes some transshipments , since most of brunei's imports transit singapore .
japan and malaysia were the second-largest suppliers .
as in many other countries , japanese products dominate local markets for motor vehicles , construction equipment , electronic goods , and household appliances .
the united states was the third-largest supplier of imports to brunei in *num* .
brunei's substantial foreign reserves are managed by the brunei investment agency ( bia ) , an arm of the ministry of finance .
bia's guiding principle is to increase the real value of brunei's foreign reserves while pursuing a diverse investment strategy , with holdings in the united states , japan , western europe , and the association of south east asian nations ( asean ) countries .
the brunei government actively encourages more foreign investment .
new enterprises that meet certain criteria can receive pioneer status , exempting profits from income tax for up to *num* years , depending on the amount of capital invested .
the normal corporate income tax rate is *num* % .
there is no personal income tax or capital gains tax .
one of the government's most important priorities is to encourage the development of brunei malays as leaders of industry and commerce .
there are no specific restrictions of foreign equity ownership , but local participation , both shared capital and management , is encouraged .
such participation helps when tendering for contracts with the government or brunei shell petroleum .
companies in brunei must either be incorporated locally or registered as a branch of a foreign company and must be registered with the registrar of companies .
public companies must have a minimum of seven shareholders .
private companies must have a minimum of two but not more than *num* shareholders .
at least half of the directors in a company must be residents of brunei .
the government owns a cattle farm in australia that supplies most of the country's beef .
at , this ranch is larger than brunei itself .
eggs and chickens are largely produced locally , but most of brunei's other food needs must be imported .
agriculture and fisheries are among the industrial sectors that the government has selected for highest priority in its efforts to diversify the economy .
the following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2017 .
brunei shell petroleum ( bsp ) , a joint venture owned in equal shares by the brunei government and the royal dutch / shell group of companies , is the chief oil and gas production company in brunei .
it also operates the country's only refinery .
bsp and four sister companies constitute the largest employer in brunei after the government .
bsp's small refinery has a distillation capacity of .
this satisfies domestic demand for most petroleum products .
the french oil company elf aquitaine became active in petroleum exploration in brunei in the 1980s .
its affiliate elf petroleum asia bv has discovered commercially exploitable quantities of oil and gas in three of the four wells drilled since *num* , including a particularly promising discovery announced in early *num* .
recently , unocal , partnered with new zealand's fletcher challenge has been granted concessions for oil exploration .
brunei is preparing to tender concessions for deep water oil and gas exploration .
brunei's oil production peaked in *num* at over .
since then it has been deliberately cut back to extend the life of oil reserves and improve recovery rates .
petroleum production is currently averaging some .
japan has traditionally been the main customer for brunei's oil exports , but its share dropped from *num* % of the total in *num* to *num* % in *num* .
in contrast , oil exports to south korea increased from only *num* % of the total in *num* to *num* % in *num* .
other major customers include taiwan ( *num* % ) , and the countries of asean ( *num* % ) .
brunei's oil exports to the united states accounted for *num* % of the total exported .
almost all of brunei's natural gas is liquefied at brunei liquefied natural gas ( lng ) plant , which opened in *num* and is one of the largest lng plants in the world .
over *num* % of brunei's lng produced is sold to japan under a long-term agreement renewed in *num* .
the agreement calls for brunei to provide over *num* million tons of lng per year to three japanese utilities .
the japanese company , mitsubishi , is a joint venture partner with shell and the brunei government in brunei lng , brunei coldgas , and brunei shell tankers , which together produce the lng and supply it to japan .
since *num* , brunei has supplied more than *num* , *num* tons of lng to the korea gas corporation as well .
in *num* , brunei's natural gas production reached *num* cargoes per day .
a small amount of natural gas is used for domestic power generation .
brunei is the fourth-largest exporter of lng in the asia-pacific region behind indonesia , malaysia , and australia .
brunei's proven oil and gas reserves are sufficient until at least *num* , and planned deep sea exploration is expected to find significant new reserves .
the government sought in the past decade to diversify the economy with limited success .
oil and gas and government spending still account for most of brunei's economic activity .
brunei's non-petroleum industries include agriculture , forestry , fishing , and banking .
in *num* , brunei registered its third year of economic recession , the only asean nation to do so .
declining oil prices and a drop in production due to maintenance and repair work at major oil wells have dented the country’s budget which will see a deficit in the fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016-17 .
in the western part of the country , liang is currently experiencing a major development with the establishment of spark , which is a *num* hectare site developed to be a world class petrochemical hub .
the first major investment at spark is the usd450 million methanol plant developed by the brunei methanol company , a joint venture between petroleum brunei and two leading japanese companies , mitsubishi chemical holdings and itochu .
the plant design will give an output of *num* , 500t of methanol per day ( *num* , 000t annually ) .
the plant was officially launched by sultan of brunei hassanal bolkiah on the *ord* of may *num* .
brunei darussalam in july *num* launched its national halal branding scheme brunei halal which allows manufacturers in brunei and in other countries to use the premium brunei halal trademark to help them penetrate lucrative markets in countries with significant numbers of muslim consumers .
the brunei halal brand is said to be the first proper attempt to put together a global halal brand that will reap the potential commercial returns of catering to the consumption needs of muslims worldwide .
as envisioned by the sultanate , the use of the brunei halal brand would signify to muslim consumers the manufacturers ' strict compliance with laws relating to islamic teachings .
brunei also aims to build confidence in the brand through strategies that will both ensure the halal integrity of the products and unfaltering compliance with set rules governing the sourcing of raw materials , manufacturing process , logistics and distribution .
a new company , government-owned brunei wafirah holdings sdn bhd , has been established as the owner of the brunei halal brand .
wafirah has entered into a joint venture with brunei global islamic investment and hong kong-based logistics firm kerry fsda limited to form ghanim international food corporation sdn bhd .
ghanim international manages the use of the brunei halal trademark .
producers that want to use the brand are required to first acquire the brunei halal label ( or the certification for compliance with accepted manufacturing and slaughtering practices under islam ) through the department of syariah affairs ' halal food control section .
they can then approach ghanim for their application to use the brand .
this is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of brunei darussalam at market prices estimated by the international monetary fund with figures in millions of bruneian dollars .
in the 1970s , brunei invested sharply increasing revenues from petroleum exports and maintained government spending at a low and constant rate .
consequently , the government was able to build its foreign reserves and invest them around the world to help provide for future generations .
part of the reserve earnings were reportedly also used to help finance the government's annual budget deficit .
since *num* , however , petroleum revenues have decreased , and government spending has increased .
the government has been running a budget deficit since *num* .
the disappearance of a revenue surplus has made brunei's economy more vulnerable to petroleum price fluctuations .
brunei's gross domestic product ( gdp ) soared with the petroleum price increases of the 1970s to a peak of $5 .
*num* billion in *num* .
it declined slightly in each of the next *num* years , then fell by almost *num* % in *num* .
this drop was caused by a combination of sharply lower petroleum prices in world markets and voluntary production cuts in brunei .
the gdp recovered somewhat since *num* , growing by *num* % in *num* , *num* % in *num* , and *num* % in *num* .
in recent years , gdp growth was *num* .
*num* % in *num* , *num* .
*num* % in *num* , *num* .
*num* % in *num* , and an estimated *num* .
*num* % in *num* .
however , the *num* gdp was still only about $4 .
*num* billion , well below the *num* peak .
the asian financial crisis in *num* and *num* , coupled with fluctuations in the price of oil have created uncertainty and instability in brunei's economy .
in addition , the *num* collapse of amedeo development corporation , brunei's largest construction firm whose projects helped fuel the domestic economy , caused the country to slip into a mild recession .
camelot camelot is a castle and court associated with the legendary king arthur .
absent in the early arthurian material , camelot first appeared in 12th-century french romances and , after the lancelot-grail cycle , eventually came to be described as the fantastic capital of arthur's realm and a symbol of the arthurian world .
the stories locate it somewhere in great britain and sometimes associate it with real cities , though more usually its precise location is not revealed .
most scholars regard it as being entirely fictional , its unspecified geography being perfect for chivalric romance writers .
nevertheless , arguments about the location of the " real camelot " have occurred since the *ord* century and continue to rage today in popular works and for tourism purposes .
the name's derivation is uncertain .
it has numerous different spellings in medieval french arthurian romances , including camaalot , camalot , chamalot , camehelot ( sometimes read as " camchilot " ) , camaaloth , caamalot , camahaloth , camaelot , kamaalot , kamaaloth , kaamalot , kamahaloth , kameloth , kamaelot , kamelot , kaamelot , cameloth , camelot and gamalaot .
arthurian scholar ernst brugger suggested that it was a corruption of the site of arthur's final battle , the battle of camlann , in welsh tradition .
roger sherman loomis believed it was derived from " cavalon " , a place name that he suggested was a corruption of avalon ( under the influence of the breton place name " cavallon " ) .
he further suggested that cavalon became arthur's capital due to confusion with arthur's other traditional court at carlion ( " caer lleon " in welsh ) .
others have suggested a derivation from the british iron age and romano-british place name camulodunum , one of the first capitals of roman britain and which would have significance in romano-british culture .
indeed , john morris , the english historian who specialized in the study of the institutions of the roman empire and the history of sub-roman britain , suggested in his book " the age of arthur " that as the descendants of romanized britons looked back to a golden age of peace and prosperity under rome , the name " camelot " of arthurian legend may have referred to the capital of britannia ( camulodunum ) in roman times .
it is unclear , however , where chrétien de troyes would have encountered the name camulodunum , or why he would render it as " camaalot " , though urban t .
holmes argued in *num* that chretien had access to book *num* of pliny's " natural history " , where it is rendered as " camaloduno " .
given chrétien's known tendency to create new stories and characters , being the first to mention the hero lancelot's love affair with queen guinevere for example , the name might also be entirely invented .
arthur's court at camelot is mentioned for the first time in chrétien's poem " lancelot , the knight of the cart " , dating to the 1170s , though it does not appear in all the manuscripts .
in the c manuscript ( paris , bibliothèque nationale de france , fonds français *num* , folio 27r ) , which might in fact contain the proper reading of chretien's original text , instead of the place name we find the old french phrase " con lui plot " , meaning " as he pleased " .
the other manuscripts spell the name variously as " chamalot " ( ms a , f .
f .
196r ) , " camehelot " ( ms e , f .
1r ) , " chamaalot " ( ms g , f .
34f ) , and " camalot " [ ms t , f .
41v ] ; the name is missing , along with the rest of the passage containing it , in ms v [ vatican , biblioteca vaticana , regina *num* ] ) .
in the tale , the court is mentioned only in passing and is not described : nothing in chrétien's poem suggests the level of importance camelot would have in later romances .
for chrétien , arthur's chief court was in caerleon in wales ; this was the king's primary base in geoffrey of monmouth's " historia regum britanniae " and subsequent literature .
chrétien depicts arthur , like a typical medieval monarch , holding court at a number of cities and castles .
it is not until the 13th-century french prose romances , including the lancelot-grail and the post-vulgate cycles , that camelot began to supersede caerleon , and even then , many descriptive details applied to camelot derive from geoffrey's earlier grand depiction of the welsh town .
most arthurian romances of this period produced in english or welsh did not follow this trend ; camelot was referred to infrequently , and usually in translations from french .
one exception is " sir gawain and the green knight " , which locates arthur's court at " camelot " ; however , in britain , arthur's court was generally located at caerleon , or at carlisle , which is usually identified with the " carduel " of the french romances .
the romancers ' versions of camelot drew on earlier descriptions of arthur's fabulous court .
from geoffrey's grand description of caerleon , camelot gains its impressive architecture , its many churches and the chivalry and courtesy of its inhabitants .
geoffrey's description in turn drew on an already established tradition in welsh oral tradition of the grandeur of arthur's court .
the tale " culhwch and olwen " , associated with the " mabinogion " and perhaps written in the *ord* century , draws a dramatic picture of arthur's hall and his many powerful warriors who go from there on great adventures , placing it in celliwig , an uncertain locale in cornwall .
the lancelot-grail cycle and the texts it influenced depict the city of camelot as standing along a river , downstream from astolat .
it is surrounded by plains and forests , and its magnificent cathedral , st .
stephen's , is the religious centre for arthur's knights of the round table .
there , arthur and guinevere are married and there are the tombs of many kings and knights .
in a mighty castle stands the round table ; it is here that galahad conquers the siege perilous , and where the knights see a vision of the holy grail and swear to find it .
jousts are held in a meadow outside the city .
its imprecise geography serves the romances well , as camelot becomes less a literal place than a powerful symbol of arthur's court and universe .
in the " palamedes " and other works , the castle is eventually destroyed by king mark of cornwall after the loss of arthur at the battle of camlann .
there is a kamaalot featured as the home of percival's mother in the romance " perlesvaus " .
although the court at celliwig is the most prominent in remaining early welsh manuscripts , the various versions of the welsh triads agree in giving arthur multiple courts , one in each of the areas inhabited by the celtic britons : cornwall , wales and the hen ogledd .
this perhaps reflects the influence of widespread oral traditions common by *num* which are recorded in various place names and features such as arthur's seat , indicating arthur was a hero known and associated with many locations across brittonic areas of britain as well as brittany .
even at this stage arthur could not be tied to one location .
many other places are listed as a location where arthur holds court in the later romances , carlisle and london perhaps being the most prominent .
in the late *ord* century , thomas malory created the image of camelot most familiar to english speakers today in his " le morte d'arthur " , a work based mostly on the french romances .
he firmly identifies camelot with winchester in england , an identification that remained popular over the centuries , though it was rejected by malory's own editor , william caxton , who preferred a welsh location .
arthurian scholar norris j .
lacy commented that " camelot , located no where in particular , can be anywhere .
" the romancers ' versions of camelot draw on earlier traditions of arthur's fabulous court .
the celliwig of " culhwch and olwen " appears in the welsh triads as well ; this early welsh material places wales ' greatest leader outside its national boundaries .
geoffrey's description of caerleon is probably based on his personal familiarity with the town and its roman ruins ; it is less clear that caerleon was associated with arthur before geoffrey .
several french romances ( " perlesvaus " , the didot " perceval " attributed to robert de boron , and even the early romances of chrétien such as " erec and enide " and " yvain , the knight of the lion " ) have arthur hold court at " carduel in wales , " a northern city based on the real carlisle .
malory's identification of camelot as winchester was probably partially inspired by the latter city's history : it had been the capital of wessex under alfred the great , and boasted the winchester round table , an artifact constructed in the *ord* century but widely believed to be the original by malory's time .
caxton rejected the association , saying camelot was in wales and that its ruins could still be seen ; this is a likely reference to the roman ruins at caerwent .
in *num* , john leland reported the locals around cadbury castle , formerly known as camalet , in somerset considered it to be the original camelot .
this theory , which was repeated by later antiquaries , is bolstered , or may have derived from , cadbury's proximity to the river cam and the villages of queen camel and west camel , and remained popular enough to help inspire a large-scale archaeological dig in the *ord* century .
these excavations , led by archaeologist leslie alcock from 1966–70 , were titled " cadbury-camelot " and won much media attention .
the dig revealed that the site seems to have been occupied as early as the *ord* millennium and to have been refortified and occupied by a major brittonic ruler and his war band from .
this early medieval settlement continued until around *num* .
the works were by far the largest known fortification of the period , double the size of comparative " caers " and with mediterranean artifacts representing extensive trade and saxon ones showing possible conquest .
the use of the name camelot and the support of geoffrey ashe helped ensure much publicity for the finds , but alcock himself later grew embarrassed by the supposed arthurian connection to the site .
following the arguments of david dumville , alcock felt the site was too late and too uncertain to be a tenable camelot .
modern archaeologists follow him in rejecting the name , calling it instead cadbury castle hill fort .
despite this , cadbury remains widely associated with camelot .
the name of the romano-british town of camulodunum ( modern colchester ) was derived from the celtic god camulus .
however , it was located well within territory usually thought to have been conquered early in the *ord* century by saxons , so it is unlikely to have been the location of any " true " camelot .
the town was definitely known as colchester as early as the " anglo-saxon chronicle " in *num* .
even colchester museum argues strongly regarding the historical arthur : " it would be impossible and inconceivable to link him to the colchester area , or to essex more generally , " pointing out that the connection between the name camulodunum and colchester was unknown until the *ord* century .
professor peter field has suggested that another camulodunum , a former roman fort , is a likely location of king arthur's camelot and that " slack , on the outskirts of huddersfield in west yorkshire , " is where arthur would have held court .
this is because of the name , and also regarding its strategic location : it is but a few miles from the extreme south-west of hen ogledd ( also making close to north wales ) , and would have been a great flagship point in staving off attacks to the celtic kingdoms from the angles and others .
other places in britain with names related to " camel " have also been suggested , such as camelford in cornwall , located down the river camel from where geoffrey places camlann , the scene of arthur's final battle .
the area's connections with camelot and camlann are merely speculative .
further north camelon and its connections with arthur's o'on have been mentioned in relation to camelot , but camelon may be an antiquarian neologism coined after the *ord* century , with its earlier name being " carmore " or " carmure " .
camelot has become a permanent fixture in interpretations of the arthurian legend .
the symbolism of camelot so impressed alfred , lord tennyson that he wrote up a prose sketch on the castle as one of his earliest attempts to treat the legend .
modern stories typically retain camelot's lack of precise location and its status as a symbol of the arthurian world , though they typically transform the castle itself into romantically lavish visions of a high middle ages palace .
some writers of the " realist " strain of modern arthurian fiction have attempted a more sensible camelot .
inspired by alcock's cadbury-camelot excavation , some authors such as marion zimmer bradley and mary stewart place their camelots in that place and describe it accordingly .
camelot lends its name to the musical " camelot " , which was adapted into a film of the same title , featuring the castle of coca , segovia as camelot .
an arthurian television series " camelot " was also named after the castle , as were some other works including the video game " camelot " and the comic book series " camelot *num* " .
french television series " kaamelott " presents a humorous alternative version of the arthurian legend ; camelot theme park is a now-abandoned arthurian theme park resort located in the english county of lancashire .
in american contexts , camelot refers to the presidency of john f .
kennedy .
in a *num* " life " interview , jacqueline , his widow , referenced a line from the lerner and loewe musical to describe the kennedy white house : " don't let it be forgot , that once there was a spot , for one brief shining moment , that was known as camelot .
" she indicated that it was one of kennedy's favorite lyrics from the musical and added , " there'll be great presidents again , but there'll never be another camelot again .
[ … ] it will never be that way again .
french guinea french guinea ( ) was a french colonial possession in west africa .
its borders , while changed over time , were in *num* those of the current independent nation of guinea .
french guinea was established by france in *num* , within the same borders as its previous colony known as rivières du sud ( 1882–1891 ) .
prior to *num* , the coastal portions of french guinea were part of the french colony of senegal .
in *num* , rivières du sud was placed under the colonial lieutenant governor at dakar , who had authority over the french coastal regions east to porto-novo ( modern benin ) .
in *num* rivières du sud , cote d'ivoire and dahomey were separated into ' independent ' colonies , with rivières du sud being renamed as the colony of french guinea .
in *num* , french guinea was made one of several dependent colonies and its governor became one of several lieutenant governors who reported to a governor-general in dakar .
in *num* , this federation of colonies was formalised as french west africa .
french guinea , senegal , dahomey , cote d'ivoire and upper senegal and niger , were each ruled by a lieutenant governor , under the governor general in dakar .
guinea was ruled by france until *num* .
it became independent from france in *num* following its voters ' rejection of charles de gaulle's constitution of *num* .
at the time french guinea was the only colony to reject the new constitution .
french guinea became the modern-day country of guinea , keeping french as its official language .
film stock film stock is an analog medium that is used for recording motion pictures or animation .
it is a strip or sheet of transparent plastic film base coated on one side with a gelatin emulsion containing microscopically small light-sensitive silver halide crystals .
the sizes and other characteristics of the crystals determine the sensitivity , contrast and resolution of the film .
the emulsion will gradually darken if left exposed to light , but the process is too slow and incomplete to be of any practical use .
instead , a very short exposure to the image formed by a camera lens is used to produce only a very slight chemical change , proportional to the amount of light absorbed by each crystal .
this creates an invisible latent image in the emulsion , which can be chemically developed into a visible photograph .
in addition to visible light , all films are sensitive to x-rays and high-energy particles .
most are at least slightly sensitive to invisible ultraviolet ( uv ) light .
some special-purpose films are sensitive into the infrared ( ir ) region of the spectrum .
in black-and-white photographic film there is usually one layer of silver salts .
when the exposed grains are developed , the silver salts are converted to metallic silver , which blocks light and appears as the black part of the film negative .
color film has at least three sensitive layers .
dyes , which adsorb to the surface of the silver salts , make the crystals sensitive to different colors .
typically the blue-sensitive layer is on top , followed by the green and red layers .
during development , the exposed silver salts are converted to metallic silver , just as with black-and-white film .
but in a color film , the by-products of the development reaction simultaneously combine with chemicals known as color couplers that are included either in the film itself or in the developer solution to form colored dyes .
because the by-products are created in direct proportion to the amount of exposure and development , the dye clouds formed are also in proportion to the exposure and development .
following development , the silver is converted back to silver salts in the " bleach step " .
it is removed from the film in the " fix step " .
fixing leaves behind only the formed color dyes , which combine to make up the colored visible image .
later color films , like kodacolor ii , have as many as *num* emulsion layers , with upwards of *num* different chemicals in each layer .
early motion picture experiments in the 1880s were performed using a fragile paper roll film , with which it was difficult to view a single , continuously moving image without a complex apparatus .
the first transparent and flexible film base material was celluloid , which was discovered and refined for photographic use by john carbutt , hannibal goodwin , and george eastman .
eastman kodak made celluloid film commercially available in *num* ; thomas henry blair , in *num* , was his first competitor .
the stock had a frosted base to facilitate easier viewing by transmitted light .
emulsions were orthochromatic .
by november *num* william dickson , at edison's laboratory , was using blair's stock for kinetoscope experiments .
blair's company supplied film to edison for five years .
between *num* and *num* , eastman experienced problems with production .
because of patent lawsuits in *num* , blair left his american company and established another in britain .
eastman became edison's supplier of film .
blair's new company supplied european filmmaking pioneers , including birt acres , robert paul , george albert smith , charles urban , and the lumiere brothers .
by *num* the new movie projector required a fully transparent film base that blair's american operation could not supply .
eastman shortly thereafter bought the company out and became the leading supplier of film stock .
louis lumiere worked with victor planchon to adapt the lumiere " blue label " ( etiquette bleue ) photographic plate emulsion for use on celluloid roll film , which began in early *num* .
eastman's first motion picture film stock was offered in *num* .
at first the film was the same as photographic film .
by *num* , separate " cine type " films were offered .
from *num* , eastman supplied their motion picture roll film in rolls of *num* feet , while blair's rolls were *num* feet .
if longer lengths were needed , the unexposed negative rolls could be cemented in a darkroom , but this was largely undesirable by most narrative filmmakers .
the makers of actuality films were much more eager to undertake this method , however , in order to depict longer actions .
they created cemented rolls as long as *num* feet .
american mutoscope and biograph was the first known company to use such film for the jeffries-sharkey fight on november *num* , *num* .
as the quantity of film and filmmakers grew , the demand for standardization increased .
between *num* and *num* , film formats gradually became standardized and film stocks improved .
a number of film gauges were made .
eastman increased the length of rolls to *num* feet without major adjustments to the emulsion , retaining a large market share .
lumiere reformulated its stock to match the speed of eastman film , naming it ' etiquette violette ' ( violet label ) .
blair sold his english company to pathé in *num* and retired to the us .
pathe began to supplement its operation in *num* by purchasing film prints , stripping the emulsion from the film base and re-coating it .
35mm film began to become the dominant gauge because of the popularity of edison's and lumière's cameras .
consumers usually purchased unperforated film and had to punch it by perforators that were often imprecise , causing difficulty in making prints for the opposite perforation format .
in *num* , the perforators began to be made by bell and howell .
eastman kodak used the bell and howell's machine to perforate its films .
in *num* , edison's organization of the motion picture patents trust agreed to what would become the standard : *num* mm gauge , with edison perforations and a *num* .
*num* aspect ratio .
agfa began to produce motion picture film in *num* , but remained a largely local supplier until world war i boycotts of popular french , american and italian film stocks allowed the ufa film studio to flourish , boosting agfa's orders .
all film stocks were manufactured on a nitrate film base , which is highly flammable .
nitrate film fires were difficult to extinguish .
a significant number of fatal accidents occurred in theatrical projection booths , where the heat of the projector lamp made ignition most likely .
amateur filmmaking ( home movies ) slowly developed during this period .
kodak developed a heat-resistant ' safety base ' for home projection .
in *num* , tests showed cellulose diacetate to be a viable replacement base , and kodak began selling acetate-base films the following year in *num* mm widths for edison's work on the home kinetoscope , which was commercially released in *num* .
eastman kodak introduced a non-inflammable *num* mm film stock in *num* .
the plasticizers used to make the film flexible evaporated quickly , making the film dry and brittle , causing splices to part and perforations to tear .
in *num* the major american film studios returned to using nitrate stock .
more amateur formats began to use acetate-based film , and several , including kodak's own *num* mm format , were designed specifically to be manufactured with safety base .
kodak released cine negative film type e in *num* and type f ( later known as negative film par speed type *num* ) in *num* .
as both of these orthochromatic films were no faster than previous offeringst , he improvements were in granularity and sharpness .
film stock manufacturers began to diversify their products .
each manufacturer had previously offered one negative stock ( usually orthochromatic ) and one print stock .
in *num* , a variant of type f film known as x-back was introduced to counteract the effects of static electricity on the film , which can cause sparking and create odd exposure patterns on the film .
a resin backing was used on the film , which rendered the film too opaque to allow focusing through the back of the film , a common technique for many cameras of that era .
the x-back stock was popular on the east coast of the us .
other manufacturers were established in the 1920s , including american e .
i .
dupont de nemours in *num* and belgian gevaert in *num* .
panchromatic film stock became more common .
created in *num* for use in color film processes such as kinemacolor , panchromatic was first used in a black-and-white film for exterior sequences in " queen of the sea " ( *num* ) and originally available as a special order product .
the stock's increased sensitivity to red light made it an attractive option for day for night shooting .
kodak financed a feature in *num* , shot entirely with panchromatic stock , " the headless horseman " , to promote the film when kodak introduced it as a standard option .
panchromatic film stock was expensive and no motion pictures were produced in entirety on it for several years .
the cross-cutting between panchromatic and orthochromatic stocks caused continuity problems with costume tones and panchromatic film was often avoided .
orthochromatic film remained dominant until the mid-1920s due to kodak's lack of competition in the panchromatic market .
in *num* , gevaert introduced an orthochromatic stock with limited color sensitivity and a fully panchromatic stock , pan-23 .
in *num* , kodak lowered the price of panchromatic stock to parity with its orthochromatic offering and the panchromatic stock began to overtake the orthochromatic stock's market share within a few years .
similar panchromatic film stocks were manufactured by agfa and pathé , the shift to panchromatic stocks had largely been completed by *num* , and kodak discontinued orthochromatic stock in *num* .
experiments with colour films were made as early as the late *ord* century , but practical colour film was not commercially viable until *num* , and for amateur use when kodak introduced kodachrome for *num* mm in *num* and *num* mm in *num* .
before *num* , commercially successful colour processes used special cameras loaded with black-and-white separation stocks rather than colour negative .
kinemacolor ( 1908–1914 ) , technicolor processes *num* through *num* ( 1917–1954 ) , and cinecolor used one , two or three strips of monochrome film stock sensitized to certain primary colours or exposed behind colour filters in special cameras .
technicolor introduced a colour reversal stock , called monopack , for location shooting in *num* ; it was ultimately a *num* mm version of kodachrome that could be used in standard motion picture cameras .
eastman kodak introduced their first 35mm colour negative stock , eastman colour negative film *num* , in *num* .
a higher quality version in *num* , eastman colour negative film *num* , was quickly adopted by hollywood for colour motion picture production , replacing both the expensive three-strip technicolor process and monopack .
there are several variables in classifying stocks ; in practice , one orders raw stock by a code number , based on desired sensitivity to light .
a piece of film consists of a light-sensitive emulsion applied to a tough , transparent base , sometimes attached to anti-halation backing or " rem-jet " layer ( now only on camera films ) .
originally the highly flammable cellulose nitrate was used .
in the 1930s , film manufacturers introduced " safety film " with a cellulose triacetate plastic base .
all amateur film stocks were safety film , but the use of nitrate persisted for professional releases .
kodak discontinued the manufacture of nitrate base in *num* , and the industry transitioned entirely to safety film in *num* in the united states and by *num* internationally .
since the late 1990s , almost all release prints have used polyester film stock .
the emulsion consists of silver halide grains suspended in a gelatin colloid ; in the case of color film , there are three layers of silver halide , which are mixed with color couplers and interlayers that filter specific light spectra .
these end up creating yellow , cyan , and magenta layers in the negative after development .
development chemicals applied to an appropriate film can produce either a positive ( showing the same densities and colors as the subject ) or negative image ( with dark highlights , light shadows , and , in principle , complementary colors ) .
the first films were darkened by light : negative films .
later films that produce a positive image became known as reversal films ; processed transparent film of this type can be projected onto a screen .
negative images need to be transferred onto photographic paper or other substrate which reverses the image again , producing a final positive image .
creating a positive image from a negative film can also be done by scanning the negative to create a computer file which can then be reversed by software .
different emulsions and development processes exist for a variety of image recording possibilities : the two most common of which are black and white , and color .
however , there are also variant types , such as infrared film ( in black and white or false color ) ; specialist technical films , such as those used for x-rays ; and obsolete processes , such as orthochromatic film .
generally , however , the vast majority of stock used today is " normal " ( visible spectrum ) color , although " normal " black and white also commands a significant minority percentage .
film is also classified according to its gauge and the arrangement of its perforations— gauges range from *num* mm to *num* mm or more , while perforations may vary in shape , pitch , and positioning .
the film is also distinguished by how it is wound with regard to perforations and base or emulsion side , as well as whether it is packaged around a core , a daylight spool , or within a cartridge .
depending on the manufacturing processes and camera equipment , lengths can vary anywhere from *num* to *num* feet .
common lengths include *num* feet for *num* mm , *num* feet for super *num* , *num* and *num* feet for *num* mm , *num* and *num* feet for *num* mm , and *num* for *num* / *num* mm .
a critical property of a stock is its film speed , determined by asa or its sensitivity to light listed by a measurement on the raw stock which must be chosen with care .
speed determines the range of lighting conditions under which the film can be shot , and is related to granularity and contrast , which influence the look of the image .
the stock manufacturer will usually give an exposure index ( ei ) number equal to the asa which they recommend exposing for .
however , factors such as forced or non-standard development ( such as bleach bypass or cross processing ) , compensation for filters or shutter angle , as well as intended under- and over-exposure may cause the cinematographer to actually " rate " the stock differently from the ei .
this new rating is not a change to the stock itself — it is merely a way of calculating exposure without figuring out the compensation after each light reading .
another important quality of colour film stock in particular is its colour balance , which is defined by the colour temperature at which it accurately records white .
tungsten lighting is defined at *num* k , which is considered " warmer " in tone and shifted towards orange ; daylight is defined at *num* k , which is considered " colder " and shifted towards blue .
this means that unfiltered tungsten stock will look normal shot under tungsten lights , but blue if shot during daylight .
conversely , daylight stock shot in daylight will look normal , but orange if shot under tungsten lights .
colour temperature issues such as these can be compensated for by other factors such as lens filters and colour gels placed in front of the lights .
the colour temperature of a film stock is generally indicated next to the film speed number — e .
g .
500t stock is colour film stock with an asa of *num* and balanced for tungsten light ; 250d would have an asa of *num* and be balanced for daylight .
while black-and-white film has no colour temperature itself , the silver halide grains themselves tend to be slightly more responsive to blue light , and therefore will have daylight and tungsten speeds — e .
g .
kodak's double-x stock is rated 250d / 200t , since the tungsten light will give slightly less exposure than an equivalent amount of daylight .
all plastic is subject to deterioration through physical or chemical means , and thus , motion picture film is subject to the same deterioration .
films deteriorate over time , which can damage individual frames or even lead to the entire film being destroyed .
cellulose nitrate , cellulose diacetate and triacetate are known to be unstable mediums : improperly preserved film can deteriorate in a period of time much faster than many photographs or other visual presentations .
cellulose nitrate , because of its unstable chemistry , eventually breaks down , releasing nitric acid , further catalyzing the decomposition .
in the final stages of celluloid decomposition , the film turns into a rust-like powder .
likewise , tri-acetate stock is also vulnerable to deterioration .
because of the small gauge of the film , owners of home-made films often find that their film can become shrunken and brittle to the point where the film is unwatchable in the space of a few years .
in general , decaying acetate film breaks down into acetic acid , and similar to celluloid decomposition , leads to an auto-catylictic breakdown of the base that cannot be reversed .
the result of the acetic acid released is a strong odor of vinegar , which is why the decay process in the archival community is known as " vinegar syndrome " .
modern polyester-based stocks are far more stable by comparison and are rated to last hundreds of years if stored properly .
the distinction between camera stocks and print stocks involves a difference in the recording process .
when the work print or edit master has been approved , the original camera negative ( ocn ) is assembled by a negative cutter using the edited work print or edl ( edit decision list ) as a guide .
a series of answer prints are then made from the ocn .
during the answer print stage , corrections in the film's density and color are corrected ( timed ) to the filmmakers ' tastes .
interpositive ( ip ) prints are struck from the ocn , checked to make sure they look the same as the custom timed answer print , and then each ip is used to make one or more dupe negative ( dn ) copies .
the release prints are then generated from the dn ( s ) .
recently , with the development of digital intermediate ( di ) , it has become possible to completely edit , composite visual effects , and color grade the image digitally at full resolution and bit-depth .
in this workflow , the answer print is generated digitally and then written out to the ip stage using a laser film printer .
due to the specialized nature of the exposure and the higher degree of control afforded by the film lab equipment , these intermediate and release stocks are specially designed solely for these applications and are generally not feasible for camera shooting .
because intermediates only function to maintain the image information accurately across duplication , each manufacturer tends to only produce one or two different intermediate stocks .
similarly , release print stocks usually are available only in two varieties : a " normal " print or a deluxe print ( on more-costly print film like kodak vision premiere ) with slightly greater saturation and contrast .
use of film remained the dominant form of cinematography until the early *ord* century when digital formats supplanted the use of film in many applications .
this has also led to the replacement of film projectors with digital projection .
yet , digital videos are sometimes deliberately altered to achieve a film look , such as adding film grain or other noise for artistic effect .
list of major biblical figures the bible is a canonical collection of texts considered sacred in judaism or christianity .
different religious groups include different books within their canons , in different orders , and sometimes divide or combine books , or incorporate additional material into canonical books .
christian bibles range from the sixty-six books of the protestant canon to the eighty-one books of the ethiopian orthodox church canon .
according to the book of genesis , the israelites were descendants of the sons of jacob , who was renamed israel after wrestling with an angel .
his twelve male children become the ancestors of the twelve tribes of israel .
list of major league baseball career total bases leaders in baseball statistics , total bases ( tb ) is the number of bases a player has gained with hits .
it is a weighted sum for which the weight value is *num* for a single , *num* for a double , *num* for a triple and *num* for a home run .
only bases attained from hits count toward this total .
reaching base by other means ( such as a base on balls ) or advancing further after the hit ( such as when a subsequent batter gets a hit ) does not increase the player's total bases .
the total bases divided by the number of at bats is the player's slugging average .
hank aaron is the career leader in total bases with *num* , *num* .
stan musial ( *num* , *num* ) and willie mays ( *num* , *num* ) are the only other players with at least *num* , *num* career total bases .
freikorps freikorps ( , " free corps " ) were german volunteer units that existed from the *ord* to the early *ord* centuries , which effectively fought as mercenary or private armies , regardless of their own nationality .
in german-speaking countries , the first so-called " freikorps " ( " free regiments " , ) were formed in the *ord* century from native volunteers , enemy renegades and deserters .
these sometimes exotically equipped units served as infantry and cavalry ( or more rarely as artillery ) , sometimes in just company strength , sometimes in formations up to several thousand strong ; there were also various mixed formations or legions .
the prussian " von kleist freikorps " included infantry , jäger , dragoons and hussars .
the french volontaires de saxe combined uhlans and dragoons .
in the aftermath of world war i and during the german revolution of 1918–19 , " freikorps " consisting largely of world war i veterans were raised as right-wing paramilitary militias , ostensibly to fight on behalf of the government against the soviet-backed german communists attempting to overthrow the weimar republic .
however , the " freikorps " also largely despised the republic and were involved in assassinations of its supporters .
the very first " freikorps " were recruited by frederick the great during the seven years ' war .
on *num* july *num* , frederick ordered the creation of a squadron of volunteer hussars to be attached to the *ord* regiment of hussars ( von kleist's own ) .
he entrusted the creation and command of this new unit to colonel friedrich wilhelm von kleist .
this first squadron ( *num* men ) was raised in dresden and consisted mainly of hungarian deserters .
this squadron was placed under the command of lieutenant johann michael von kovacs .
at the end of *num* , the first four squadrons of dragoons ( also called horse grenadiers ) of the " freikorps " were organised .
they initially consisted of prussian volunteers from berlin , magdeburg , mecklenburg and leipzig , but later recruited deserters .
the " freikorps " were regarded as unreliable by regular armies , so they were mainly used as sentries and for minor duties .
these early " freikorps " appeared during the war of the austrian succession and especially the seven years ' war , when france , prussia and the habsburg monarchy embarked on an escalation of petty warfare while conserving their regular regiments .
even during the last kabinettskrieg , the war of the bavarian succession , " freikorp " formations were formed in *num* .
germans , hungarians , poles , lithuanians and south slavs , as well as turks , tatars and cossacks , were believed by all warring parties to be inherently good fighters .
the nationality of many soldiers can no longer be ascertained as the ethnic origin was often described imprecisely in the regimental lists .
slavs ( croats , serbs ) were often referred to as " hungarians " or just " croats " , and muslim recruits ( albanians , bosnians , tatars ) as " turks " .
for prussia , the pandurs , who were made up of croats and serbs , were a clear model for the organization of such " free " troops .
frederick the great created *num* " free infantry " ( " frei-infanterie " ) units , mainly between *num* and *num* , which were intended to be attractive to those soldiers who wanted military " adventure " , but did not want to have to do military drill .
a distinction should be made between the " freikorps " formed up to *num* for the final years of the war , which operated independently and disrupted the enemy with surprise attacks and the free infantry which consisted of various military branches ( such as infantry , hussars , dragoons , " jäger " ) and were used in combination .
they were often used to ward off maria theresa's pandurs .
in the era of linear tactics , light troops had been seen necessary for outpost , reinforcement and reconnaissance duties .
during the war , eight such volunteer corps were set up : because , with some exceptions , they were seen as undisciplined and less battleworthy , they were used for less onerous guard and garrison duties .
in the so-called " petty wars " , the " freikorps " interdicted enemy supply lines with guerrilla warfare .
in the case of capture , their members were at risk of being executed as irregular fighters .
in prussia the " freikorps " , which frederick the great had despised as " vermin " , were disbanded .
their soldiers were given no entitlement to pensions or invalidity payments .
in france , many corps continued to exist until *num* .
they were attached to regular dragoon regiments as " jäger " squadrons .
during the napoleonic wars , austria recruited various " freikorps " of slavic origin .
the slavonic wurmser " freikorps " fought in alsace .
the combat effectiveness of the six viennese " freikorps " ( *num* , *num* infantrymen and cavalrymen ) , however , was low .
an exception were the border regiments of croats and serbs who served permanently on the austro-ottoman border .
"freikorps " in the modern sense emerged in germany during the course of the napoleonic wars .
they fought not so much for money but rather out of patriotic motives , seeking to shake off the french confederation of the rhine .
after the french under emperor napoleon had either conquered the german states or forced them to collaborate , remnants of the defeated armies continued to fight on in this fashion .
famous formations included the king's german legion , who had fought for britain in french-occupied spain and were mainly recruited from hanoverians , the lützow free corps and the black brunswickers .
the " freikorps " attracted many nationally disposed citizens and students .
" freikorps " commanders such as ferdinand von schill , ludwig adolf wilhelm von lützow or frederick william , duke of brunswick-wolfenbüttel , known as the " black duke " , led their own attacks on napoleonic occupation forces in germany .
those led by schill were decimated in the battle of stralsund ( *num* ) ; many were killed in battle or executed at napoleon's command in the aftermath .
the " freikorps " were very popular during the period of the german war of liberation ( 1813–15 ) , during which von lützow , a survivor of schill's " freikorps " , formed his lützow free corps .
the anti-napoleonic " freikorps " often operated behind french lines as a kind of commando or guerrilla force .
throughout the *ord* century , these anti-napoleonic " freikorps " were greatly praised and glorified by german nationalists , and a heroic myth built up around their exploits .
this myth was invoked , in considerably different circumstances , in the aftermath of germany's defeat in world war i .
even in the aftermath of the napoleonic era , " freikorps " were set up with varying degrees of success .
during the march *num* riots , student " freikorps " were set up in munich .
in first schleswig war of *num* the " freikorps " of " von der tann " , " zastrow " and others distinguished themselves .
in *num* in mexico , the french formed the so-called " contreguerrillas " under former prussian hussar officer , milson .
in italy , garibaldi formed his famous " freischars " , notably the " thousand of marsala " , which landed in sicily in *num* .
even before the franco-prussian war of *num* / *num* , " freikorps " were developed in france that were known as franc-tireurs .
the meaning of the word " freikorps " changed over time .
after *num* , the term was used for the paramilitary organizations that sprang up around germany as soldiers returned in defeat from world war i .
they were the key weimar paramilitary groups active during that time .
many german veterans felt disconnected from civilian life , and joined a " freikorps " in search of stability within a military structure .
others , angry at their sudden , apparently inexplicable defeat , joined up in an effort to put down communist uprisings , such as the spartacist uprising , or exact some form of revenge on those they considered responsible for the armistice .
they received considerable support from minister of defence gustav noske , a member of the social democratic party of germany .
noske used them to crush the german revolution of 1918–19 and the marxist spartacist league , including arresting karl liebknecht and rosa luxemburg , who were killed on *num* january *num* .
they were also used to defeat the bavarian soviet republic in may *num* .
on *num* may *num* , members of " freikorps " lützow in perlach near munich , acted on a tip from a local cleric and arrested and killed twelve alleged communist workers ( most of them actually members of the social democratic party ) .
a memorial on pfanzeltplatz in munich today commemorates the incident .
"freikorps " also fought against the communists in the baltics , silesia , poland and east prussia after the end of world war i , including aviation combat , often with significant success .
anti-slavic racism was sometimes present , although the ethnic cleansing ideology and anti-semitism that would be expressed in later years had not yet developed .
in the baltics they fought against communists as well as against the newborn independent democratic countries estonia and latvia .
in latvia , freikorps murdered *num* civilians in mitau who were suspected of having " bolshevik sympathies " .
after the capture of riga , another *num* alleged communists were killed , including summary executions of 50–60 prisoners daily .
though officially disbanded in *num* , some of them continued to exist for several years and many freikorps ' attempted , unsuccessfully , to overthrow the government in the kapp putsch in march *num* .
their attack was halted when german citizens loyal to the government went on strike , cutting off many services and making daily life so problematic that the coup was called off .
in *num* , adolf hitler had just begun his political career as the leader of the tiny and as-yet-unknown deutsche arbeiterpartei / dap german workers ' party , which was soon renamed the nationalsozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei / nsdap ( national socialist german workers party ) or nazi party in munich .
numerous future members and leaders of the nazi party had served in the " freikorps " , including ernst röhm , future head of the sturmabteilung , or sa , heinrich himmler , future head of the schutzstaffel , or ss , and rudolf höß , the future " kommandant " of the auschwitz concentration camp .
hermann ehrhardt , founder and leader of marinebrigade ehrhardt , and his deputy commander eberhard kautter , leaders of the viking league , refused to help hitler and erich ludendorff in their beer hall putsch and conspired against them .
hitler eventually viewed some of them as threats .
a huge ceremony was arranged on *num* november *num* in which the " freikorps " leaders symbolically presented their old battle flags to hitler's sa and ss .
it was a sign of allegiance to their new authority , the nazi state .
when hitler's internal purge of the party , the night of the long knives , came in *num* , a large number of freikorps leaders were targeted for killing or arrest , including ehrhardt and röhm .
historian robert gl waite claims that in hitler's " röhm purge " speech to the " reichstag " on *num* july *num* , he implied that the freikorps were one of the groups of " pathological enemies of the state " .
in french , the freikorps are referred to as " corps franc .
" starting in october *num* , the french army stood up a number of corps franc units with the mission of carrying out ambush , raid , and harassing operations forward of the maginot line during the period known as the phoney war ( drôle de guerre ) .
they were tasked with attacking german troops guarding the siegfried line .
future vichy collaborationist , anti-bolshevik and ss major joseph darnand was one of the more famous participants in these commando actions .
in may of *num* , the experience of the phoney war era corps franc was an influence in creating the groupes francs motorisé de cavalerie ( gfc ) who played storied role in the delaying operations and last stands of the battle of france , notably in the defenses of the seine and the loire .
on november *num* *num* , in the immediate aftermath of the allied invasion of vichy french north africa the corps francs d'afrique ( cfa ) ( african corps franc ) was stood up in french morocco within the free french forces by general giraud .
giraud drew the members of the all-volunteer unit from moroccans of diverse religious backgrounds ( christian , jew , and muslim ) and gave them the title of " vélite " a name inspired by the elite light infantry of napoleon's imperial guard who were named after the roman velites .
much of the corps was drawn from henri d'astier de la vigerie and josé aboulker's géo gras french resistance group which had been responsible for the algiers insurrection where the resistance seized control of algiers on the night of november *num* *num* in coordination with the allied landings happening that same night .
in taking over algiers , they managed to capture both admiral darlan and general juin which led to the darlan deal wherein vichy french forces came over to the allied side .
darlan was later assassinated by fernand bonnier de la chapelle an early member of the corps franc d'afrique .
they functioned as the free french equivalent to the british commandos .
the corps francs d'afrique went on to fight rommel's afrikakorps in tunisia with the u .
s .
*ord* army .
they fought alongside the british *ord* brigade at kassarine and sidi nasr where they famously conducted a heroic bayonet charge , facing two to one odds , against the italian *ord* battalion of the *ord* bersaglieri near the mountain of kef zilia on the road to bizerte , taking *num* prisoners , killing the italian battalion commander , and capturing the plans for operation auslading .
they participated in the capture of bizerte in may *num* .
for its actions , the corps franc d'afrique was awarded the croix de guerre .
the cfa was formally dissolved on july *num* *num* , with its members and equipment forming the corps of the newly created african commando group ( gca ) on july *num* *num* in dupleix , algeria , today seen as a forbear to the post war parachutist shock battalions and the modern day *ord* rdp .
the gca went on to fight at pianosa , elba , salerno , provence , belfort , giromagny , alsace , cernay , guebwiller , buhl , and the invasion of germany .
emperor yūryaku yūryaku is remembered as a patron of sericulture .
no firm dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign , but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from *num* to *num* .
yūryaku was a 5th-century monarch .
the reign of emperor kinmei ( – *num* ad ) , the *ord* emperor , is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates ; however , the conventionally accepted names and dates of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as " traditional " until the reign of emperor kanmu ( 737–806 ) , the *ord* sovereign of the yamato dynasty .
according to the " kojiki " , this emperor is said to have ruled from the thirteenth day of the eleventh month of *num* ( heishin ) until his death on the seventh day of the eight month of *num* ( kibi ) .
according to " kojiki " and " nihon shoki " , yūryaku was named prince ōhatsuse wakatake ( 大泊瀬 幼武 ) at birth .
swords unearthed from some kofun tombs , such as the inariyama sword pictured at right , indicate his name was waka takeru ( ōkimi ) .
yūryaku is a name posthumously assigned to him by a much later era .
he was the fifth and youngest son of emperor ingyō .
after his elder brother emperor ankō was murdered , he won the struggle against his other brothers and became the new emperor .
his title in his own lifetime was certainly not " tennō " , but presumably " ōkimi " and / or " sumeramikoto " ( 治天下大王 - amenoshita shiroshimesu ōkimi , or sumera no mikoto , great king who rules all under heaven ) and / or king of yamato ( ヤマト大王 / 大君 - yamato ōkimi , great king of yamato ) .
he had three wives ( including his consort kusahahatahi ) .
his successor , prince shiraka ( emperor seinei ) , was his son by his wife kazuraki no karahime .
in *num* , yūryaku tennō invited the thunder god of the mimuro hill to come to the imperial palace , and ordered chiisakobe no muraji sugaru to fetch the deity .
he obliged , thinking the supernatural being would have no reason to refuse the invitation , and rode carrying a halberd with a red banner , symbolising his office of royal messenger .
soon enough , the thunder stroke , and sugaru enlisted the help of priests to enshrine the kami into a portable carriage , to be brought in the emperor's presence , as a great serpent .
but , said emperor neglected to practice proper ritual purification and religious abstinence .
the thunder kami then showed his displeasure through thundering and threatening fiery eyeballs , and emperor yūryaku fled into the interior of the palace while covering his eyes .
the great serpent was returned to mimuro , and the emperor made many offerings to appease the angry deity .
this story is recorded in nihongi and mentioned by william george aston , in " shinto , the ancient religion of japan " as well as several other books .
according to the nihongi , yūryaku was of ungovernable and suspicious temperament , and committed many acts of arbitrary cruelty .
the actual site of yūryaku's grave is not known .
this emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial shinto shrine ( " misasagi " ) in habikino , osaka , which is designated by the imperial household agency as yūryaku's mausoleum .
it is formally named " tajihi no takawashi-no-hara no misasagi " .
empress : princess kusaka-no-hatabihime ( 草香幡梭姫皇女 ) , emperor nintoku’s daughter consort : katsuragi no karahime ( 葛城韓媛 ) , katsuragi no tsubura no ōomi’s daughter consort : kibi no wakahime ( 吉備稚媛 , d .
*num* ) , kibi no kamitsumichi no omi’s daughter consort : wani no ominagimi ( 和珥童女君 ) , kasuga no wani no omi fukame’s daughter according to the book of song , a king bu ( 武 ) from japan dispatched envoys to the emperor of liu song , a minor chinese dynasty , in both *num* and *num* .
communications included a notice that the previous ruler , an older brother , had died , and that bu had ascended to the throne .
the king ' bu ' in this document is believed to refer to emperor yūryaku , in part based on the fact that the character used to write the name ( 武 ) can also be read as " take " or " takeru " in japanese , and is found in the name by which emperor yūryaku was called during his lifetime : wakatakeru ōkimi .
the chinese historical records state that bu began his rule before *num* , was recognized as the ruler of japan by the liu song , southern qi , and liang dynasties , and continued his rule through to *num* .
this japanese sovereign's interest in poetry is amongst the more well-documented aspects of his character and reign .
poems attributed to this 5th-century monarch are included in the " man'yōshū " , and a number of his verses are preserved in the " kojiki " and the " nihonshoki .
abelian group in abstract algebra , an abelian group , also called a commutative group , is a group in which the result of applying the group operation to two group elements does not depend on the order in which they are written .
that is , these are the groups that obey the axiom of commutativity .
abelian groups generalize the arithmetic of addition of integers .
they are named after early *ord* century mathematician niels henrik abel .
the concept of an abelian group is one of the first concepts encountered in undergraduate abstract algebra , from which many other basic concepts , such as modules and vector spaces , are developed .
the theory of abelian groups is generally simpler than that of their non-abelian counterparts , and finite abelian groups are very well understood .
on the other hand , the theory of infinite abelian groups is an area of current research .
an abelian group is a set , " a " , together with an operation • that combines any two elements " a " and " b " to form another element denoted .
the symbol • is a general placeholder for a concretely given operation .
to qualify as an abelian group , the set and operation , , must satisfy five requirements known as the " abelian group axioms " : a group in which the group operation is not commutative is called a " non-abelian group " or " non-commutative group " .
there are two main notational conventions for abelian groups – additive and multiplicative .
generally , the multiplicative notation is the usual notation for groups , while the additive notation is the usual notation for modules and rings .
the additive notation may also be used to emphasize that a particular group is abelian , whenever both abelian and non-abelian groups are considered , some notable exceptions being near-rings and partially ordered groups , where an operation is written additively even when non-abelian .
to verify that a finite group is abelian , a table ( matrix ) – known as a cayley table – can be constructed in a similar fashion to a multiplication table .
if the group is under the operation ⋅ , the entry of this table contains the product .
the group is abelian if and only if this table is symmetric about the main diagonal .
this is true since if the group is abelian , then .
this implies that the entry of the table equals the entry , thus the table is symmetric about the main diagonal .
in general , matrices , even invertible matrices , do not form an abelian group under multiplication because matrix multiplication is generally not commutative .
however , some groups of matrices are abelian groups under matrix multiplication – one example is the group of 2×2 rotation matrices .
camille jordan named abelian groups after norwegian mathematician niels henrik abel , because abel found that the commutativity of the group of a polynomial implies that the roots of the polynomial can be calculated by using radicals .
see section *num* .
*num* of cox ( *num* ) for more information on the historical background .
if " n " is a natural number and " x " is an element of an abelian group " g " written additively , then " nx " can be defined as ( " n " summands ) and .
in this way , " g " becomes a module over the ring z of integers .
in fact , the modules over z can be identified with the abelian groups .
theorems about abelian groups ( i .
e .
modules over the principal ideal domain z ) can often be generalized to theorems about modules over an arbitrary principal ideal domain .
a typical example is the classification of finitely generated abelian groups which is a specialization of the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain .
in the case of finitely generated abelian groups , this theorem guarantees that an abelian group splits as a direct sum of a torsion group and a free abelian group .
the former may be written as a direct sum of finitely many groups of the form z / "p"z for " p " prime , and the latter is a direct sum of finitely many copies of z .
if are two group homomorphisms between abelian groups , then their sum , defined by , is again a homomorphism .
( this is not true if " h " is a non-abelian group .
) the set of all group homomorphisms from " g " to " h " thus turns into an abelian group in its own right .
somewhat akin to the dimension of vector spaces , every abelian group has a " rank " .
it is defined as the maximal cardinality of a set of linearly independent elements of the group .
the integers and the rational numbers have rank one , as well as every subgroup of the rationals .
the center " z " ( " g " ) of a group " g " is the set of elements that commute with every element of " g " .
a group " g " is abelian if and only if it is equal to its center " z " ( " g " ) .
the center of a group " g " is always a characteristic abelian subgroup of " g " .
if the quotient group " g" / "z " ( " g " ) of a group by its center is cyclic then " g " is abelian .
cyclic groups of integers modulo " n " , z / "n"z , were among the first examples of groups .
it turns out that an arbitrary finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups of prime power order , and these orders are uniquely determined , forming a complete system of invariants .
the automorphism group of a finite abelian group can be described directly in terms of these invariants .
the theory had been first developed in the *num* paper of georg frobenius and ludwig stickelberger and later was both simplified and generalized to finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain , forming an important chapter of linear algebra .
any group of prime order is isomorphic to a cyclic group and therefore abelian .
any group whose order is a square of a prime number is abelian .
in fact , for every prime number " p " there are ( up to isomorphism ) exactly two groups of order " p " , namely z and z×z .
the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups states that every finite abelian group " g " can be expressed as the direct sum of cyclic subgroups of prime-power order ; it is also known as the basis theorem for finite abelian groups .
this is generalized by the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups , with finite groups being the special case when " g " has zero rank ; this in turn admits numerous further generalizations .
the classification was proven by leopold kronecker in *num* , though it was not stated in modern group-theoretic terms until later , and was preceded by a similar classification of quadratic forms by gauss in *num* ; see history for details .
the cyclic group z of order " mn " is isomorphic to the direct sum of z and z if and only if " m " and " n " are coprime .
it follows that any finite abelian group " g " is isomorphic to a direct sum of the form in either of the following canonical ways : for example , z can be expressed as the direct sum of two cyclic subgroups of order *num* and *num* : the same can be said for any abelian group of order *num* , leading to the remarkable conclusion that all abelian groups of order *num* are isomorphic .
for another example , every abelian group of order *num* is isomorphic to either z ( the integers *num* to *num* under addition modulo *num* ) , ( the odd integers *num* to *num* under multiplication modulo *num* ) , or .
see also list of small groups for finite abelian groups of order *num* or less .
one can apply the fundamental theorem to count ( and sometimes determine ) the automorphisms of a given finite abelian group " g " .
to do this , one uses the fact that if " g " splits as a direct sum of subgroups of coprime order , then .
given this , the fundamental theorem shows that to compute the automorphism group of " g " it suffices to compute the automorphism groups of the sylow " p"-subgroups separately ( that is , all direct sums of cyclic subgroups , each with order a power of " p " ) .
fix a prime " p " and suppose the exponents " e " of the cyclic factors of the sylow " p"-subgroup are arranged in increasing order : for some .
one needs to find the automorphisms of one special case is when " n " = *num* , so that there is only one cyclic prime-power factor in the sylow " p"-subgroup " p " .
in this case the theory of automorphisms of a finite cyclic group can be used .
another special case is when " n " is arbitrary but .
here , one is considering " p " to be of the form so elements of this subgroup can be viewed as comprising a vector space of dimension " n " over the finite field of " p " elements f .
the automorphisms of this subgroup are therefore given by the invertible linear transformations , so where gl is the appropriate general linear group .
this is easily shown to have order in the most general case , where the " e " and " n " are arbitrary , the automorphism group is more difficult to determine .
it is known , however , that if one defines and then one has in particular , , and one can check that this yields the orders in the previous examples as special cases ( see hillar , c .
, & rhea , d .
) .
an abelian group is finitely generated if it contains a finite set of elements ( called " generators " ) formula_10 such that every element of the group is a linear combination with integer coefficients of elements of .
let be a free abelian group with basis formula_11 there is a unique group homomorphism formula_12 such that this homomorphism is surjective , and its kernel is finitely generated ( since integers form a noetherian ring ) .
let us consider the matrix with integer entries , such that the entries of its th column are the coefficients of the th generator of the kernel .
then , the abelian group is isomorphic to the cokernel of linear map defined by .
conversely every integer matrix defines a finitely generated abelian group .
it follows that the study of finitely generated abelian groups is totally equivalent with the study of integer matrices .
in particular , changing the generating set of is equivalent with multiplying on the left by a unimodular matrix ( that is an invertible integer matrix whose inverse is also an integer matrix ) .
changing the generating set of the kernel of is equivalent with multiplying on the right by an unimodular matrix .
the smith normal form of is a matrix where and are unimodular , and is a matrix such that all non-diagonal entries are zero , the non-zero diagonal entries are the first ones , and is a divisor of for .
the existence and the shape of the smith normal proves that the finitely generated abelian group is the direct sum where is the number of zero rows at the bottom of ( and also the rank of the group ) .
this is the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups .
the existence of algorithms for smith normal form shows that the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups is not only a theorem of abstract existence , but provides a way for computing expression of finitely generated abelian groups as direct sums .
the simplest infinite abelian group is the infinite cyclic group z .
any finitely generated abelian group " a " is isomorphic to the direct sum of " r " copies of z and a finite abelian group , which in turn is decomposable into a direct sum of finitely many cyclic groups of primary orders .
even though the decomposition is not unique , the number " r " , called the rank of " a " , and the prime powers giving the orders of finite cyclic summands are uniquely determined .
by contrast , classification of general infinitely generated abelian groups is far from complete .
divisible groups , i .
e .
abelian groups " a " in which the equation admits a solution for any natural number " n " and element " a " of " a " , constitute one important class of infinite abelian groups that can be completely characterized .
every divisible group is isomorphic to a direct sum , with summands isomorphic to q and prüfer groups q / z for various prime numbers " p " , and the cardinality of the set of summands of each type is uniquely determined .
moreover , if a divisible group " a " is a subgroup of an abelian group " g " then " a " admits a direct complement : a subgroup " c " of " g " such that .
thus divisible groups are injective modules in the category of abelian groups , and conversely , every injective abelian group is divisible ( baer's criterion ) .
an abelian group without non-zero divisible subgroups is called reduced .
two important special classes of infinite abelian groups with diametrically opposite properties are " torsion groups " and " torsion-free groups " , exemplified by the groups q / z ( periodic ) and q ( torsion-free ) .
an abelian group is called periodic or torsion , if every element has finite order .
a direct sum of finite cyclic groups is periodic .
although the converse statement is not true in general , some special cases are known .
the first and second prüfer theorems state that if " a " is a periodic group , and it either has a bounded exponent , i .
e .
, for some natural number " n " , or is countable and the " p"-heights of the elements of " a " are finite for each " p " , then " a " is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups .
the cardinality of the set of direct summands isomorphic to z / "p"z in such a decomposition is an invariant of " a " .
these theorems were later subsumed in the kulikov criterion .
in a different direction , helmut ulm found an extension of the second prüfer theorem to countable abelian " p"-groups with elements of infinite height : those groups are completely classified by means of their ulm invariants .
an abelian group is called torsion-free if every non-zero element has infinite order .
several classes of torsion-free abelian groups have been studied extensively : an abelian group that is neither periodic nor torsion-free is called mixed .
if " a " is an abelian group and " t " ( " a " ) is its torsion subgroup , then the factor group " a" / "t " ( " a " ) is torsion-free .
however , in general the torsion subgroup is not a direct summand of " a " , so " a " is " not " isomorphic to .
thus the theory of mixed groups involves more than simply combining the results about periodic and torsion-free groups .
one of the most basic invariants of an infinite abelian group " a " is its rank : the cardinality of the maximal linearly independent subset of " a " .
abelian groups of rank *num* are precisely the periodic groups , while torsion-free abelian groups of rank *num* are necessarily subgroups of q and can be completely described .
more generally , a torsion-free abelian group of finite rank " r " is a subgroup of q .
on the other hand , the group of " p"-adic integers z is a torsion-free abelian group of infinite z-rank and the groups z with different " n " are non-isomorphic , so this invariant does not even fully capture properties of some familiar groups .
the classification theorems for finitely generated , divisible , countable periodic , and rank *num* torsion-free abelian groups explained above were all obtained before *num* and form a foundation of the classification of more general infinite abelian groups .
important technical tools used in classification of infinite abelian groups are pure and basic subgroups .
introduction of various invariants of torsion-free abelian groups has been one avenue of further progress .
see the books by irving kaplansky , lászló fuchs , phillip griffith , and david arnold , as well as the proceedings of the conferences on abelian group theory published in " lecture notes in mathematics " for more recent findings .
the additive group of a ring is an abelian group , but not all abelian groups are additive groups of rings ( with nontrivial multiplication ) .
some important topics in this area of study are : many large abelian groups possess a natural topology , which turns them into topological groups .
the collection of all abelian groups , together with the homomorphisms between them , forms the category ab , the prototype of an abelian category .
nearly all well-known algebraic structures other than boolean algebras are undecidable .
hence it is surprising that tarski's student proved that the first order theory of abelian groups , unlike its nonabelian counterpart , is decidable .
this decidability , plus the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups described above , highlight some of the successes in abelian group theory , but there are still many areas of current research : moreover , abelian groups of infinite order lead , quite surprisingly , to deep questions about the set theory commonly assumed to underlie all of mathematics .
take the whitehead problem : are all whitehead groups of infinite order also free abelian groups ? in the 1970s , saharon shelah proved that the whitehead problem is : among mathematical adjectives derived from the proper name of a mathematician , the word " abelian " is rare in that it is often spelled with a lowercase a , rather than an uppercase a , indicating how ubiquitous the concept is in modern mathematics .
blitz basic blitz basic refers to the programming language dialect that was interpreted by the first blitz compilers , devised by new zealand-based developer mark sibly .
being derived from basic , blitz syntax was designed to be easy to pick up for beginners first learning to program .
the languages are game-programming oriented but are often found general-purpose enough to be used for most types of application .
the blitz language evolved as new products were released , with recent incarnations offering support for more advanced programming techniques such as object-orientation and multi-threading .
this led to the languages losing their basic moniker in later years .
the first iteration of the blitz language was created for the amiga platform and published by the australian firm memory and storage technology .
returning to new zealand , blitz basic *num* was published several years later by acid software ( a local amiga game publisher ) .
since then , blitz compilers have been released on several platforms .
following the demise of the amiga as a commercially viable platform , the blitz basic *num* source code was released to the amiga community .
development continues to this day under the name amiblitz .
idigicon published blitzbasic for microsoft windows in october *num* .
the language included a built-in api for performing basic 2d graphics and audio operations .
following the release of blitz3d , blitzbasic is often synonymously referred to as blitz2d .
recognition of blitzbasic increased when a limited range of " free " versions were distributed in popular uk computer magazines such as pc format .
this resulted in a legal dispute between the developer and publisher which was eventually resolved amicably .
in february *num* , blitz research ltd .
released blitzplus also for microsoft windows .
it lacked the 3d engine of blitz3d , but did bring new features to the 2d side of the language by implementing limited microsoft windows control support for creating native guis .
backwards compatibility of the 2d engine was also extended , allowing compiled blitzplus games and applications to run on systems that might only have directx *num* .
the first blitzmax compiler was released in december *num* for mac os x .
this made it the first blitz dialect that could be compiled on *nix platforms .
compilers for microsoft windows and linux were subsequently released in may *num* .
blitzmax brought the largest change of language structure to the modern range of blitz products by extending the type system to include object-oriented concepts and modifying the graphics api to better suit opengl .
blitzmax was also the first of the blitz languages to represent strings internally using ucs2 , allowing native-support for string literals composed of non-ascii characters .
blitzmax's platform-agnostic command-set allows developers to compile and run source code on multiple platforms .
however the official compiler and build chain will only generate binaries for the platform that it is executing on .
unofficially , users have been able to get linux and mac os x to cross-compile to the windows platform .
blitzmax is also the first modular version of the blitz languages , improving the extensibility of the command-set .
in addition , all of the standard modules shipped with the compiler are open-source and so can be tweaked and recompiled by the programmer if necessary .
the official blitzmax cross-platform gui module ( known as maxgui ) allows developers to write gui interfaces for their applications on linux ( fltk ) , mac ( cocoa ) and windows .
various user-contributed modules extend the use of the language by wrapping such libraries as wxwidgets , cairo , and fontconfig as well as a selection of database modules .
there are also a selection of third-party 3d modules available namely minib3d - an open-source opengl engine which can be compiled and used on all three of blitzmax's supported platforms .
in october *num* , blitzmax *num* .
*num* was released which included the addition of a reflection module .
blitzmax *num* .
*num* shipped new threading and lua scripting modules and most of the standard library functions have been updated so that they are unicode friendly .
blitz3d sdk is a 3d graphics engine based on the engine in blitz3d .
it was marketed for use with c++ , c# , blitzmax and purebasic , however it could also be used with other languages that follow compatible calling conventions .
a game example for blitz3d is scp – containment breach which was made with blitz3d in *num* , the source code to max3d - a c++-based cross-platform 3d engine - was released under a bsd license .
this engine focused on opengl but had an abstract backend for other graphics drivers ( such as directx ) and made use of several open-source libraries , namely assimp , boost and ode .
despite the excitement in the blitz community of max3d being the eagerly awaited successor to blitz3d , interest and support died off soon after the source code was released and eventually development came to a halt .
there is no indication that blitz research will pick up the project again .
blitzplus was released as open-source on *num* april *num* under the zlib license on github .
com .
blitz3d followed soon after and was released as open source on *num* august *num* .
blitzmax was later released as open source on *num* september *num* .
the following code creates a windowed application that shows the current time in binary and decimal format .
this code is written in blitzbasic , but will compile and run in both blitz3d and blitzplus .
see below for the same example written in blitzmax .
in *num* , brl released a new cross-platform programming language called monkey and its first official module called mojo .
monkey has a similar syntax to blitzmax , but instead of compiling direct to assembly code , it translates monkey source files directly into source code for a chosen language , framework or platform e .
g .
windows , mac os x , ios , android , html5 , and adobe flash .
development of monkey has been halted in favor of monkey2 , an updated version of the language by mark sibly .
eth eth ( , uppercase : ð , lowercase : ð ; also spelled edh or eð ) is a letter used in old english , middle english , icelandic , faroese ( in which it is called " edd " ) , and elfdalian .
it was also used in scandinavia during the middle ages but was subsequently replaced with " dh " and later " d " .
it is often transliterated as " d " ( and " d- " is rarely used as a mnemonic ) .
the lowercase version has been adopted to represent a voiced dental fricative in the international phonetic alphabet .
in old english , " ð " ( called " " by the anglo-saxons ) was used interchangeably with " þ " to represent the old english dental fricative phoneme , which exists in modern english phonology as the voiced and voiceless dental fricatives now spelled " th " .
unlike the runic letter þ , ð is a modified roman letter .
ð was not found in the earliest records of old english .
a study of mercian royal diplomas found that ð ( along with đ ) began to emerge in the early *ord* century , with ð becoming strongly preferred by the 780s .
another source indicates that the letter is " derived from irish writing " .
the lowercase version has retained the curved shape of a medieval scribe's " d " , which " d " itself in general has not .
" ð " was used throughout the anglo-saxon era but gradually fell out of use in middle english , practically disappearing altogether by *num* ; " þ " survived longer , ultimately being replaced by the digraph " th " .
in icelandic , " ð " represents a voiced dental fricative , which is the same as the " th " in english " that " , but it never appears as the first letter of a word , where " þ " is used in its stead .
the name of the letter is pronounced in isolation ( and before words beginning with a voiceless consonant ) as and therefore with a voiceless rather than voiced fricative .
in faroese , " ð " is not assigned to any particular phoneme and appears mostly for etymological reasons ; however , it does show where most of the faroese glides are ; when " ð " appears before " r " , it is , in a few words , pronounced .
in the icelandic and faroese alphabets , " ð " follows " d " .
in olav jakobsen høyem's version of based on , " ð " was always silent and was introduced for etymological reasons .
"ð " has also been used by some in written welsh to represent , which is normally represented as " dd " .
carnot heat engine a carnot heat engine is a theoretical engine that operates on the reversible carnot cycle .
the basic model for this engine was developed by nicolas léonard sadi carnot in *num* .
the carnot engine model was graphically expanded upon by benoît paul émile clapeyron in *num* and mathematically explored by rudolf clausius in *num* from which the concept of entropy emerged .
every thermodynamic system exists in a particular state .
a thermodynamic cycle occurs when a system is taken through a series of different states , and finally returned to its initial state .
in the process of going through this cycle , the system may perform work on its surroundings , thereby acting as a heat engine .
a heat engine acts by transferring energy from a warm region to a cool region of space and , in the process , converting some of that energy to mechanical work .
the cycle may also be reversed .
the system may be worked upon by an external force , and in the process , it can transfer thermal energy from a cooler system to a warmer one , thereby acting as a refrigerator or heat pump rather than a heat engine .
in the adjacent diagram , from carnot's *num* work , " reflections on the motive power of fire " , there are " two bodies " a " and " b " , kept each at a constant temperature , that of " a " being higher than that of " b " .
these two bodies to which we can give , or from which we can remove the heat without causing their temperatures to vary , exercise the functions of two unlimited reservoirs of caloric .
we will call the first the furnace and the second the refrigerator .
” carnot then explains how we can obtain motive power , i .
e .
, “work” , by carrying a certain quantity of heat from body " a " to body " b " .
it also acts as a cooler and hence can also act as a refrigerator .
the previous image shows the original piston-and-cylinder diagram used by carnot in discussing his ideal engines .
the figure at right shows a block diagram of a generic heat engine , such as the carnot engine .
in the diagram , the “working body” ( system ) , a term introduced by clausius in *num* , can be any fluid or vapor body through which heat " q " can be introduced or transmitted to produce work .
carnot had postulated that the fluid body could be any substance capable of expansion , such as vapor of water , vapor of alcohol , vapor of mercury , a permanent gas , or air , etc .
although , in these early years , engines came in a number of configurations , typically " q " was supplied by a boiler , wherein water was boiled over a furnace ; " q " was typically supplied by a stream of cold flowing water in the form of a condenser located on a separate part of the engine .
the output work " w " here is the movement of the piston as it is used to turn a crank-arm , which was then typically used to turn a pulley so to lift water out of flooded salt mines .
carnot defined work as “weight lifted through a height” .
the carnot cycle when acting as a heat engine consists of the following steps : carnot's theorem is a formal statement of this fact : " no engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs .
" explanation this maximum efficiency formula_3 is defined as above : a corollary to carnot's theorem states that : all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient .
it is easily shown that the efficiency is maximum when the entire cyclic process is a reversible process .
this means the total entropy of the net system ( the entropies of the hot furnace , the " working fluid " of the heat engine , and the cold sink ) remains constant when the " working fluid " completes one cycle and returns to its original state .
( in the general case , the total entropy of this combined system would increase in a general irreversible process ) .
since the " working fluid " comes back to the same state after one cycle , and entropy of the system is a state function ; the change in entropy of the " working fluid " system is *num* .
thus , it implies that the total entropy change of the furnace and sink is zero , for the process to be reversible and the efficiency of the engine to be maximum .
this derivation is carried out in the next section .
the coefficient of performance ( cop ) of the heat engine is the reciprocal of its efficiency .
for a real heat engine , the total thermodynamic process is generally irreversible .
the working fluid is brought back to its initial state after one cycle , and thus the change of entropy of the fluid system is *num* , but the sum of the entropy changes in the hot and cold reservoir in this one cyclical process is greater than *num* .
the internal energy of the fluid is also a state variable , so its total change in one cycle is *num* .
so the total work done by the system , is equal to the heat put into the system formula_4 minus the heat taken out formula_8 .
for real engines , sections *num* and *num* of the carnot cycle ; in which heat is absorbed by the " working fluid " from the hot reservoir , and released by it to the cold reservoir , respectively ; no longer remain ideally reversible , and there is a temperature differential between the temperature of the reservoir and the temperature of the fluid while heat exchange takes place .
during heat transfer from the hot reservoir at formula_9 to the fluid , the fluid would have a slightly lower temperature than formula_9 , and the process for the fluid may not necessarily remain isothermal .
let formula_11 be the total entropy change of the fluid in the process of intake of heat .
where the temperature of the fluid is always slightly lesser than formula_9 , in this process .
so , one would get similarly , at the time of heat injection from the fluid to the cold reservoir one would have , for the magnitude of total entropy change formula_13 of the fluid in the process of expelling heat : where , during this process of transfer of heat to the cold reservoir , the temperature of the fluid is always slightly greater than formula_14 .
we have only considered the magnitude of the entropy change here .
since the total change of entropy of the fluid system for the cyclic process is *num* , we must have the previous three equations combine to give : equations ( ) and ( ) combine to give hence , where formula_15 is the efficiency of the real engine , and formula_3 is the efficiency of the carnot engine working between the same two reservoirs at the temperatures formula_9 and formula_14 .
for the carnot engine , the entire process is ' reversible ' , and equation ( ) is an equality .
hence , the efficiency of the real engine is always less than the ideal carnot engine .
equation ( ) signifies that the total entropy of the total system ( the two reservoirs + fluid ) increases for the real engine , because the entropy gain of the cold reservoir as formula_19 flows into it at the fixed temperature formula_14 , is greater than the entropy loss of the hot reservoir as formula_21 leaves it at its fixed temperature formula_9 .
the inequality in equation ( ) is essentially the statement of the clausius theorem .
according to the second theorem , " the efficiency of the carnot engine is independent of the nature of the working substance " .
bromine bromine is a chemical element with symbol br and atomic number *num* .
it is the third-lightest halogen , and is a fuming red-brown liquid at room temperature that evaporates readily to form a similarly coloured gas .
its properties are thus intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine .
isolated independently by two chemists , carl jacob löwig ( in *num* ) and antoine jérôme balard ( in *num* ) , its name was derived from the ancient greek βρῶμος ( " stench " ) , referencing its sharp and disagreeable smell .
elemental bromine is very reactive and thus does not occur free in nature , but in colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts , analogous to table salt .
while it is rather rare in the earth's crust , the high solubility of the bromide ion ( br ) has caused its accumulation in the oceans .
commercially the element is easily extracted from brine pools , mostly in the united states , israel and china .
the mass of bromine in the oceans is about one three-hundredth that of chlorine .
at high temperatures , organobromine compounds readily dissociate to yield free bromine atoms , a process that stops free radical chemical chain reactions .
this effect makes organobromine compounds useful as fire retardants , and more than half the bromine produced worldwide each year is put to this purpose .
the same property causes ultraviolet sunlight to dissociate volatile organobromine compounds in the atmosphere to yield free bromine atoms , causing ozone depletion .
as a result , many organobromide compounds—such as the pesticide methyl bromide—are no longer used .
bromine compounds are still used in well drilling fluids , in photographic film , and as an intermediate in the manufacture of organic chemicals .
large amounts of bromide salts are toxic from the action of soluble bromide ion , causing bromism .
however , a clear biological role for bromide ion and hypobromous acid has recently been elucidated , and it now appears that bromine is an essential trace element in humans .
the role of biological organobromine compounds in sea life such as algae has been known for much longer .
as a pharmaceutical , the simple bromide ion ( br ) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system , and bromide salts were once a major medical sedative , before replacement by shorter-acting drugs .
they retain niche uses as antiepileptics .
bromine was discovered independently by two chemists , carl jacob löwig and antoine balard , in *num* and *num* , respectively .
löwig isolated bromine from a mineral water spring from his hometown bad kreuznach in *num* .
löwig used a solution of the mineral salt saturated with chlorine and extracted the bromine with diethyl ether .
after evaporation of the ether a brown liquid remained .
with this liquid as a sample of his work he applied for a position in the laboratory of leopold gmelin in heidelberg .
the publication of the results was delayed and balard published his results first .
balard found bromine chemicals in the ash of seaweed from the salt marshes of montpellier .
the seaweed was used to produce iodine , but also contained bromine .
balard distilled the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine .
the properties of the resulting substance were intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine ; thus he tried to prove that the substance was iodine monochloride ( icl ) , but after failing to do so he was sure that he had found a new element , and named it muride , derived from the latin word " muria " for brine .
after the french chemists louis nicolas vauquelin , louis jacques thénard , and joseph-louis gay-lussac approved the experiments of the young pharmacist balard , the results were presented at a lecture of the académie des sciences and published in " annales de chimie et physique " .
in his publication , balard states that he changed the name from " muride " to " brôme " on the proposal of m .
anglada .
" brôme " ( bromine ) derives from the greek βρωμος ( stench ) .
other sources claim that the french chemist and physicist joseph-louis gay-lussac suggested the name " brôme " for the characteristic smell of the vapors .
bromine was not produced in large quantities until *num* , when the discovery of salt deposits in stassfurt enabled its production as a by-product of potash .
apart from some minor medical applications , the first commercial use was the daguerreotype .
in *num* , bromine was discovered to have some advantages over the previously used iodine vapor to create the light sensitive silver halide layer in daguerreotypy .
potassium bromide and sodium bromide were used as anticonvulsants and sedatives in the late *ord* and early *ord* centuries , but were gradually superseded by chloral hydrate and then by the barbiturates .
in the early years of the first world war , bromine compounds such as xylyl bromide were used as poison gas .
bromine is the third halogen , being a nonmetal in group *num* of the periodic table .
its properties are thus similar to those of fluorine , chlorine , and iodine , and tend to be intermediate between those of the two neighbouring halogens , chlorine and iodine .
bromine has the electron configuration [ ar ] 3d4s4p , with the seven electrons in the fourth and outermost shell acting as its valence electrons .
like all halogens , it is thus one electron short of a full octet , and is hence a strong oxidising agent , reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell .
corresponding to periodic trends , it is intermediate in electronegativity between chlorine and iodine ( f : *num* .
*num* , cl : *num* .
*num* , br : *num* .
*num* , i : *num* .
*num* ) , and is less reactive than chlorine and more reactive than iodine .
it is also a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine , but a stronger one than iodine .
conversely , the bromide ion is a weaker reducing agent than iodide , but a stronger one than chloride .
these similarities led to chlorine , bromine , and iodine together being classified as one of the original triads of johann wolfgang döbereiner , whose work foreshadowed the periodic law for chemical elements .
it is intermediate in atomic radius between chlorine and iodine , and this leads to many of its atomic properties being similarly intermediate in value between chlorine and iodine , such as first ionisation energy , electron affinity , enthalpy of dissociation of the x molecule ( x = cl , br , i ) , ionic radius , and x–x bond length .
the volatility of bromine accentuates its very penetrating , choking , and unpleasant odour .
all four stable halogens experience intermolecular van der waals forces of attraction , and their strength increases together with number of electrons among all homonuclear diatomic halogen molecules .
thus , the melting and boiling points of bromine are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine .
as a result of the increasing molecular weight of the halogens down the group , the density and heats of fusion and vaporisation of bromine are again intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine , although all their heats of vaporisation are fairly low ( leading to high volatility ) thanks to their diatomic molecular structure .
the halogens darken in colour as the group is descended : fluorine is a very pale yellow gas , chlorine is greenish-yellow , and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid that melts at −7 .
*num* °c and boils at *num* .
*num* °c .
( iodine is a shiny black solid .
) this trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group .
specifically , the colour of a halogen , such as bromine , results from the electron transition between the highest occupied antibonding " π " molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding " σ " molecular orbital .
the colour fades at low temperatures , so that solid bromine at −195 °c is pale yellow .
like solid chlorine and iodine , solid bromine crystallises in the orthorhombic crystal system , in a layered lattice of br molecules .
the br–br distance is *num* pm ( close to the gaseous br–br distance of *num* pm ) and the br···br distance between molecules is *num* pm within a layer and *num* pm between layers ( compare the van der waals radius of bromine , *num* pm ) .
this structure means that bromine is a very poor conductor of electricity , with a conductivity of around *num* × *num* ω cm just below the melting point , although this is better than the essentially undetectable conductivity of chlorine .
at a pressure of *num* gpa ( roughly *num* , *num* times atmospheric pressure ) bromine undergoes an insulator-to-metal transition .
at *num* gpa it changes to a face-centered orthorhombic structure .
at *num* gpa it changes to a body centered orthorhombic monatomic form .
bromine has two stable isotopes , br and br .
these are its only two natural isotopes , with br making up *num* % of natural bromine and br making up the remaining *num* % .
both have nuclear spin *num* / 2− and thus may be used for nuclear magnetic resonance , although br is more favourable .
the relatively *num* : *num* distribution of the two isotopes in nature is helpful in identification of bromine containing compounds using mass spectroscopy .
other bromine isotopes are all radioactive , with half-lives too short to occur in nature .
of these , the most important are br ( " t " = *num* .
*num* min ) , br ( " t " = *num* .
*num* h ) , and br ( " t " = *num* .
*num* h ) , which may be produced from the neutron activation of natural bromine .
the most stable bromine radioisotope is br ( " t " = *num* .
*num* h ) .
the primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than br is electron capture to isotopes of selenium ; that of isotopes heavier than br is beta decay to isotopes of krypton ; and br may decay by either mode to stable se or kr .
bromine is intermediate in reactivity between chlorine and iodine , and is one of the most reactive elements .
bond energies to bromine tend to be lower than those to chlorine but higher than those to iodine , and bromine is a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine but a stronger one than iodine .
this can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the x / x couples ( f , +2 .
*num* v ; cl , +1 .
*num* v ; br , +1 .
*num* v ; i , +0 .
*num* v ; at , approximately +0 .
*num* v ) .
bromination often leads to higher oxidation states than iodination but lower or equal oxidation states to chlorination .
bromine tends to react with compounds including m–m , m–h , or m–c bonds to form m–br bonds .
the simplest compound of bromine is hydrogen bromide , hbr .
it is mainly used in the production of inorganic bromides and alkyl bromides , and as a catalyst for many reactions in organic chemistry .
industrially , it is mainly produced by the reaction of hydrogen gas with bromine gas at 200–400 °c with a platinum catalyst .
however , reduction of bromine with red phosphorus is a more practical way to produce hydrogen bromide in the laboratory : at room temperature , hydrogen bromide is a colourless gas , like all the hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride , since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom ; however , weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline hydrogen bromide at low temperatures , similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure , before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised .
aqueous hydrogen bromide is known as hydrobromic acid , which is a strong acid ( p"k " = −9 ) because the hydrogen bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation .
the hbr / ho system also involves many hydrates hbr·"n"ho for " n " = *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , and *num* , which are essentially salts of bromine anions and hydronium cations .
hydrobromic acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point *num* .
*num* °c at *num* .
*num* g hbr per *num* g solution ; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation .
unlike hydrogen fluoride , anhydrous liquid hydrogen bromide is difficult to work with as a solvent , because its boiling point is low , it has a small liquid range , its dielectric constant is low and it does not dissociate appreciably into hbr and ions – the latter , in any case , are much less stable than the bifluoride ions ( ) due to the very weak hydrogen bonding between hydrogen and bromine , though its salts with very large and weakly polarising cations such as cs and ( r = me , et , bu ) may still be isolated .
anhydrous hydrogen bromide is a poor solvent , only able to dissolve small molecular compounds such as nitrosyl chloride and phenol , or salts with very low lattice energies such as tetraalkylammonium halides .
nearly all elements in the periodic table form binary bromides .
the exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes : extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions ( the noble gases , with the exception of xenon in the very unstable xebr ) ; extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation ( many of the heaviest elements beyond bismuth ) ; and having an electronegativity higher than bromine's ( oxygen , nitrogen , fluorine , and chlorine ) , so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not bromides but rather oxides , nitrides , fluorides , or chlorides of bromine .
( nonetheless , nitrogen tribromide is named as a bromide as it is analogous to the other nitrogen trihalides .
) bromination of metals with br tends to yield lower oxidation states than chlorination with cl when a variety of oxidation states is available .
bromides can be made by reaction of an element or its oxide , hydroxide , or carbonate with hydrobromic acid , and then dehydrated by mildly high temperatures combined with either low pressure or anhydrous hydrogen bromide gas .
these methods work best when the bromide product is stable to hydrolysis ; otherwise , the possibilities include high-temperature oxidative bromination of the element with bromine or hydrogen bromide , high-temperature bromination of a metal oxide or other halide by bromine , a volatile metal bromide , carbon tetrabromide , or an organic bromide .
for example , niobium ( v ) oxide reacts with carbon tetrabromide at *num* °c to form niobium ( v ) bromide .
another method is halogen exchange in the presence of excess " halogenating reagent " , for example : when a lower bromide is wanted , either a higher halide may be reduced using hydrogen or a metal as a reducing agent , or thermal decomposition or disproportionation may be used , as follows : most of the bromides of the pre-transition metals ( groups *num* , *num* , and *num* , along with the lanthanides and actinides in the +2 and +3 oxidation states ) are mostly ionic , while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular bromides , as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above .
silver bromide is very insoluble in water and is thus often used as a qualitative test for bromine .
the halogens form many binary , diamagnetic interhalogen compounds with stoichiometries xy , xy , xy , and xy ( where x is heavier than y ) , and bromine is no exception .
bromine forms a monofluoride and monochloride , as well as a trifluoride and pentafluoride .
some cationic and anionic derivatives are also characterised , such as , , , , and .
apart from these , some pseudohalides are also known , such as cyanogen bromide ( brcn ) , bromine thiocyanate ( brscn ) , and bromine azide ( brn ) .
the pale-brown bromine monofluoride ( brf ) is unstable at room temperature , disproportionating quickly and irreversibly into bromine , bromine trifluoride , and bromine pentafluoride .
it thus cannot be obtained pure .
it may be synthesised by the direct reaction of the elements , or by the comproportionation of bromine and bromine trifluoride at high temperatures .
bromine monochloride ( brcl ) , a red-brown gas , quite readily dissociates reversibly into bromine and chlorine at room temperature and thus also cannot be obtained pure , though it can be made by the reversible direct reaction of its elements in the gas phase or in carbon tetrachloride .
bromine monofluoride in ethanol readily leads to the monobromination of the aromatic compounds phx ( " para"-bromination occurs for x = me , bu , ome , br ; " meta"-bromination occurs for the deactivating x = –coet , –cho , –no ) ; this is due to heterolytic fission of the br–f bond , leading to rapid electrophilic bromination by br .
at room temperature , bromine trifluoride ( brf ) is a straw-coloured liquid .
it may be formed by directly fluorinating bromine at room temperature and is purified through distillation .
it reacts explosively with water and hydrocarbons , but is a less violent fluorinating reagent than chlorine trifluoride .
it reacts vigorously with boron , carbon , silicon , arsenic , antimony , iodine , and sulfur to give fluorides , and also reacts with most metals and their oxides : as such , it is used to oxidise uranium to uranium hexafluoride in the nuclear industry .
refractory oxides tend to be only partially fluorinated , but here the derivatives kbrf and brfsbf remain reactive .
bromine trifluoride is a useful nonaqueous ionising solvent , since it readily dissociates to form and and thus conducts electricity .
bromine pentafluoride ( brf ) was first synthesised in *num* .
it is produced on a large scale by direct reaction of bromine with excess fluorine at temperatures higher than *num* °c , and on a small scale by the fluorination of potassium bromide at *num* °c .
it is a very vigorous fluorinating agent , although chlorine trifluoride is still more violent .
bromine pentafluoride explodes on reaction with water and fluorinates silicates at *num* °c .
although dibromine is a strong oxidising agent with a high first ionisation energy , very strong oxidisers such as peroxydisulfuryl fluoride ( sof ) can oxidise it to form the cherry-red cation .
a few other bromine cations are known , namely the brown and dark brown .
the tribromide anion , , has also been characterised ; it is analogous to triiodide .
bromine oxides are not as well-characterised as chlorine oxides or iodine oxides , as they are all fairly unstable : it was once thought that they could not exist at all .
dibromine monoxide is a dark-brown solid which , while reasonably stable at −60 °c , decomposes at its melting point of −17 .
*num* °c ; it is useful in bromination reactions and may be made from the low-temperature decomposition of bromine dioxide in a vacuum .
it oxidises iodine to iodine pentoxide and benzene to *num* , 4-benzoquinone ; in alkaline solutions , it gives the hypobromite anion .
so-called " bromine dioxide " , a pale yellow crystalline solid , may be better formulated as bromine perbromate , brobro .
it is thermally unstable above −40 °c , violently decomposing to its elements at *num* °c .
dibromine trioxide , " syn"-brobro , is also known ; it is the anhydride of hypobromous acid and bromic acid .
it is an orange crystalline solid which decomposes above −40 °c ; if heated too rapidly , it explodes around *num* °c .
a few other unstable radical oxides are also known , as are some poorly characterised oxides , such as dibromine pentoxide , tribromine octoxide , and bromine trioxide .
the four oxoacids , hypobromous acid ( hobr ) , bromous acid ( hobro ) , bromic acid ( hobro ) , and perbromic acid ( hobro ) , are better studied due to their greater stability , though they are only so in aqueous solution .
when bromine dissolves in aqueous solution , the following reactions occur : hypobromous acid is unstable to disproportionation .
the hypobromite ions thus formed disproportionate readily to give bromide and bromate : bromous acids and bromites are very unstable , although the strontium and barium bromites are known .
more important are the bromates , which are prepared on a small scale by oxidation of bromide by aqueous hypochlorite , and are strong oxidising agents .
unlike chlorates , which very slowly disproportionate to chloride and perchlorate , the bromate anion is stable to disproportionation in both acidic and aqueous solutions .
bromic acid is a strong acid .
bromides and bromates may comproportionate to bromine as follows : there were many failed attempts to obtain perbromates and perbromic acid , leading to some rationalisations as to why they should not exist , until *num* when the anion was first synthesised from the radioactive beta decay of unstable .
today , perbromates are produced by the oxidation of alkaline bromate solutions by fluorine gas .
excess bromate and fluoride are precipitated as silver bromate and calcium fluoride , and the perbromic acid solution may be purified .
the perbromate ion is fairly inert at room temperature but is thermodynamically extremely oxidising , with extremely strong oxidising agents needed to produce it , such as fluorine or xenon difluoride .
the br–o bond in is fairly weak , which corresponds to the general reluctance of the 4p elements ( especially arsenic , selenium , and bromine ) to attain their maximum possible oxidation state , as they come after the scandide contraction characterised by the poor shielding afforded by the radial-nodeless 3d orbitals .
like the other carbon–halogen bonds , the c–br bond is a common functional group that forms part of core organic chemistry .
formally , compounds with this functional group may be considered organic derivatives of the bromide anion .
due to the difference of electronegativity between bromine ( *num* .
*num* ) and carbon ( *num* .
*num* ) , the carbon in a c–br bond is electron-deficient and thus electrophilic .
the reactivity of organobromine compounds resembles but is intermediate between the reactivity of organochlorine and organoiodine compounds .
for many applications , organobromides represent a compromise of reactivity and cost .
organobromides are typically produced by additive or substitutive bromination of other organic precursors .
bromine itself can be used , but due to its toxicity and volatility safer brominating reagents are normally used , such as " n"-bromosuccinimide .
the principal reactions for organobromides include dehydrobromination , grignard reactions , reductive coupling , and nucleophilic substitution .
organobromides are the most common organohalides in nature , even though the concentration of bromide is only *num* .
*num* % of that for chloride in sea water , because of the easy oxidation of bromide to the equivalent of br , a potent electrophile .
the enzyme bromoperoxidase catalyzes this reaction .
the oceans are estimated to release 1–2 million tons of bromoform and *num* , *num* tons of bromomethane annually .
an old qualitative test for the presence of the alkene functional group is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless , forming a bromohydrin with some of the dibromoalkane also produced .
the reaction passes through a short-lived strongly electrophilic bromonium intermediate .
this is an example of a halogen addition reaction .
bromine is significantly less abundant in the crust than fluorine or chlorine , comprising only *num* .
*num* parts per million of the earth's crustal rocks , and then only as bromide salts .
it is the forty-sixth most abundant element in earth's crust .
it is significantly more abundant in the oceans , resulting from long-term leaching .
there , it makes up *num* parts per million , corresponding to a ratio of about one bromine atom for every *num* chlorine atoms .
salt lakes and brine wells may have higher bromine concentrations : for example , the dead sea contains *num* .
*num* % bromide ions .
it is from these sources that bromine extraction is mostly economically feasible .
the main sources of bromine are in the united states and israel .
the element is liberated by halogen exchange , using chlorine gas to oxidise br to br .
this is then removed with a blast of steam or air , and is then condensed and purified .
today , bromine is transported in large-capacity metal drums or lead-lined tanks that can hold hundreds of kilograms or even tonnes of bromine .
the bromine industry is about one-hundredth the size of the chlorine industry .
laboratory production is unnecessary because bromine is commercially available and has a long shelf life .
a wide variety of organobromine compounds are used in industry .
some are prepared from bromine and others are prepared from hydrogen bromide , which is obtained by burning hydrogen in bromine .
brominated flame retardants represent a commodity of growing importance , and make up the largest commercial use of bromine .
when the brominated material burns , the flame retardant produces hydrobromic acid which interferes in the radical chain reaction of the oxidation reaction of the fire .
the mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen radicals , oxygen radicals , and hydroxy radicals react with hydrobromic acid to form less reactive bromine radicals ( i .
e .
, free bromine atoms ) .
bromine atoms may also react directly with other radicals to help terminate the free radical chain-reactions that characterise combustion .
to make brominated polymers and plastics , bromine-containing compounds can be incorporated into the polymer during polymerisation .
one method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process .
for example , vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene , polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene .
specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process for example , tetrabromobisphenol a can be added to polyesters or epoxy resins , where it becomes part of the polymer .
epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins , indicated by the fr in the abbreviation of the products ( fr-4 and fr-2 ) .
in some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation .
for example , decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers .
a number of gaseous or highly volatile brominated halomethane compounds are non-toxic and make superior fire suppressant agents by this same mechanism , and are particular effective in enclosed spaces such as submarines , airplanes , and spacecraft .
however , they are expensive and their production and use has been greatly curtailed due to their effect as ozone-depleting agents .
they are no longer used in routine fire extinguishers , but retain niche uses in aerospace and military automatic fire-suppression applications .
they include bromochloromethane ( halon *num* , chbrcl ) , bromochlorodifluoromethane ( halon *num* , cbrclf ) , and bromotrifluoromethane ( halon *num* , cbrf ) .
silver bromide is used , either alone or in combination with silver chloride and silver iodide , as the light sensitive constituent of photographic emulsions .
ethylene bromide was an additive in gasolines containing lead anti-engine knocking agents .
it scavenges lead by forming volatile lead bromide , which is exhausted from the engine .
this application accounted for *num* % of the bromine use in *num* in the us .
this application has declined since the 1970s due to environmental regulations ( see below ) .
poisonous bromomethane was widely used as pesticide to fumigate soil and to fumigate housing , by the tenting method .
ethylene bromide was similarly used .
these volatile organobromine compounds are all now regulated as ozone depletion agents .
the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer scheduled the phase out for the ozone depleting chemical by *num* , and organobromide pesticides are no longer used ( in housing fumigation they have been replaced by such compounds as sulfuryl fluoride , which contain neither the chlorine or bromine organics which harm ozone ) .
before the montreal protocol in *num* ( for example ) an estimated *num* , *num* tonnes of the chemical were used to control nematodes , fungi , weeds and other soil-borne diseases .
in pharmacology , inorganic bromide compounds , especially potassium bromide , were frequently used as general sedatives in the *ord* and early *ord* century .
bromides in the form of simple salts are still used as anticonvulsants in both veterinary and human medicine , although the latter use varies from country to country .
for example , the u .
s .
food and drug administration ( fda ) does not approve bromide for the treatment of any disease , and it was removed from over-the-counter sedative products like bromo-seltzer , in *num* .
commercially available organobromine pharmaceuticals include the vasodilator nicergoline , the sedative brotizolam , the anticancer agent pipobroman , and the antiseptic merbromin .
otherwise , organobromine compounds are rarely pharmaceutically useful , in contrast to the situation for organofluorine compounds .
several drugs are produced as the bromide ( or equivalents , hydrobromide ) salts , but in such cases bromide serves as an innocuous counterion of no biological significance .
other uses of organobromine compounds include high-density drilling fluids , dyes ( such as tyrian purple and the indicator bromothymol blue ) , and pharmaceuticals .
bromine itself , as well as some of its compounds , are used in water treatment , and is the precursor of a variety of inorganic compounds with an enormous number of applications ( e .
g .
silver bromide for photography ) .
zinc–bromine batteries are hybrid flow batteries used for stationary electrical power backup and storage ; from household scale to industrial scale .
a *num* study suggests that bromine ( in the form of bromide ion ) is a necessary cofactor in the biosynthesis of collagen iv , making the element essential to basement membrane architecture and tissue development in animals .
nevertheless , no clear deprivation symptoms or syndromes have been documented .
in other biological functions , bromine may be non-essential but still beneficial when it takes the place of chlorine .
for example , in the presence of hydrogen peroxide , ho , formed by the eosinophil , and either chloride or bromide ions , eosinophil peroxidase provides a potent mechanism by which eosinophils kill multicellular parasites ( such as , for example , the nematode worms involved in filariasis ) and some bacteria ( such as tuberculosis bacteria ) .
eosinophil peroxidase is a haloperoxidase that preferentially uses bromide over chloride for this purpose , generating hypobromite ( hypobromous acid ) , although the use of chloride is possible .
although α-haloesters are generally thought of as highly reactive , and therefore , toxic intermediates in organic synthesis , mammals , including humans , cats , and rats , appear to biosynthesize traces of an α-bromoester , 2-octyl 4-bromo-3-oxobutanoate , which is found in their cerebrospinal fluid and appears to play a yet unclarified role in inducing rem sleep .
human neutrophils use myeloperoxidase , h2o2 , and br ( - ) to brominate deoxycytidine , which is a mutagen , so transhalogenation reactions with bromine may be responsible for some human cancers .
marine organisms are the main source of organobromine compounds , and it is in these organisms that the essentiality of bromine is on much firmer ground .
more than *num* such organobromine compounds were identified by *num* .
the most abundant is methyl bromide ( chbr ) , of which an estimated *num* , *num* tonnes is produced by marine algae each year .
the essential oil of the hawaiian alga " asparagopsis taxiformis " consists of *num* % bromoform .
most of such organobromine compounds in the sea are made by the action of a unique algal enzyme , vanadium bromoperoxidase .
the bromide anion is not very toxic : a normal daily intake is *num* to *num* milligrams .
however , high levels of bromide chronically impair the membrane of neurons , which progressively impairs neuronal transmission , leading to toxicity , known as bromism .
bromide has an elimination half-life of *num* to *num* days , which can lead to excessive accumulation .
doses of *num* .
*num* to *num* gram per day of bromide can lead to bromism .
historically , the therapeutic dose of bromide is about *num* to *num* grams of bromide , thus explaining why chronic toxicity ( bromism ) was once so common .
while significant and sometimes serious disturbances occur to neurologic , psychiatric , dermatological , and gastrointestinal functions , death from bromism is rare .
bromism is caused by a neurotoxic effect on the brain which results in somnolence , psychosis , seizures and delirium .
elemental bromine is toxic and causes chemical burns on human flesh .
inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract , causing coughing , choking , and shortness of breath , and death if inhaled in large enough amounts .
chronic exposure may lead to frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health .
as a strong oxidising agent , bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds .
caution is required when transporting bromine ; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead , supported by strong metal frames .
the occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) of the united states has set a permissible exposure limit ( pel ) for bromine at a time-weighted average ( twa ) of *num* .
*num* ppm .
the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) has set a recommended exposure limit ( rel ) of twa *num* .
*num* ppm and a short-term limit of *num* .

belle and sebastian belle and sebastian are a scottish band formed in glasgow in january *num* .
led by stuart murdoch , the band has released *num* albums to date .
much of their work had been released on jeepster records , but they are now signed to rough trade records in the united kingdom and matador records in the united states .
belle and sebastian were formed in glasgow , scotland in *num* by stuart murdoch and stuart david , both of whom had enrolled at stow college's beatbox program for unemployed musicians .
together , with music professor alan rankine ( formerly of the associates ) , they recorded some demos , which were picked up by the college's music business course that produces and releases one single each year on the college's label , electric honey .
as the band had a number of songs already and the label was extremely impressed with the demos , belle and sebastian were allowed to record a full-length album , which was recorded mostly live over three days , entitled " tigermilk " .
murdoch once described the band as a " product of botched capitalism " .
the band took their name from the television adaptation of the french novel " belle et sébastien " about a six-year-old boy and his dog .
"tigermilk " was recorded in three days and originally only one thousand copies were pressed in vinyl .
these original copies now sell for up to £400 .
the warm reception the album received inspired murdoch and david to turn the band into a full-time project , recruiting stevie jackson ( guitar and vocals ) , isobel campbell ( cello / vocals ) , chris geddes ( keys ) and richard colburn ( drums ) to fill out the group .
after the success of the debut album , belle and sebastian were signed to jeepster records in august *num* and " if you're feeling sinister " , their second album , was released on *num* november .
the album was named by " spin " as one of the *num* greatest albums between *num* and *num* , and is widely considered the band's masterpiece .
just before the recording of " sinister " , sarah martin ( violin / vocals ) joined the band .
following this a series of eps were released in *num* .
the first of these was " dog on wheels " , which contained four demo tracks recorded before the real formation of the band .
in fact , the only long-term band members to play on the songs were murdoch , david , and mick cooke , who played trumpet on the ep but would not officially join the band until a few years later .
it charted at no .
*num* in the uk singles chart .
the " lazy line painter jane " ep followed in july .
the track was recorded in the church where murdoch lived and features vocals from monica queen .
the ep narrowly missed out on the uk top *num* , peaking at no .
*num* .
the last of the *num* eps was october's " *num* .
.
*num* .
.
*num* seconds of light " .
the ep was made single of the week in both the " nme " and " melody maker " and reached no .
*num* in the charts , thus becoming the band's first top *num* single .
the band released their third lp , " the boy with the arab strap " in *num* , and it reached no .
*num* in the uk charts .
" arab strap " garnered an npr interview and positive reviews from " rolling stone " and the " village voice , " among others ; however , the album has its detractors , including " pitchfork " , who gave the album a particularly poor review , calling it a " parody " of their earlier work ( pitchfork has since removed the review from their website , but re-reviewed the album positively in *num* ) .
during the recording of the album , long-time studio trumpet-player mick cooke was asked to join the band as a full member .
the " this is just a modern rock song " ep followed later that year .
in *num* the band was awarded with best newcomer ( for their third album ) at the brit awards , upsetting better-known acts such as steps and 5ive .
that same year , the band hosted their own festival , the bowlie weekender .
" tigermilk " was also given a full release by jeepster before the band started work on their next lp .
the result was " fold your hands child , you walk like a peasant " , which became the band's first top *num* album in the uk .
a stand-alone single , " legal man " , reached no .
*num* and gave them their first appearance on top of the pops .
as the band's popularity and recognition was growing worldwide , their music began appearing in films and on television .
the *num* film " high fidelity " mentions the band and features a clip from the song " seymour stein " from " the boy with the arab strap " .
also , the title track from " arab strap " was played over the end credits of the uk television series " teachers , " and the lyric " colour my life with the chaos of trouble " from the song was quoted by one of the characters in the *num* film " ( *num* ) days of summer " .
stuart david soon left the band to concentrate on his side project , looper , and his book writing , which included his " the idle thoughts of a daydreamer " .
he was replaced by bobby kildea of v-twin .
the " jonathan david " single , sung by stevie jackson , was released in june *num* and was followed by " i'm waking up to us " in november .
" i'm waking up to us " saw the band use an outside producer ( mike hurst ) for the first time .
most of *num* was spent touring and recording a soundtrack album , " storytelling " ( for " storytelling " by todd solondz ) .
campbell left the band in the spring of *num* , in the middle of the band's north american tour to pursue a solo career , first as the gentle waves , and later under her own name .
she later collaborated with singer mark lanegan on three albums .
the band left jeepster in *num* , signing a four-album deal with rough trade records .
their first album for rough trade , " dear catastrophe waitress " , was released in *num* , and was produced by trevor horn .
the album showed a markedly more " produced " sound compared to their first four lps , as the band was making a concerted effort to produce more " radio-friendly " music .
the album was warmly received and is credited with restoring the band's " indie cred " .
the album also marked the return of murdoch as the group's primary songwriter , following the poorly received " fold your hands child , you walk like a peasant " and " storytelling " , both of which were more collaborative than the band's early work .
a documentary dvd , " fans only " , was released by jeepster in october *num* , featuring promotional videos , live clips and unreleased footage .
a single from the album , " step into my office , baby " followed in november *num* ; it would be their first single to be taken from an album , and included a track recorded with divine comedy producer darren allison entitled " love on the march " .
the thin lizzy-inspired " i'm a cuckoo " was the second single from the album .
it achieved their highest chart position yet , reaching no .
*num* in the uk .
the " books " ep followed , a double a-side single led by " wrapped up in books " from " dear catastrophe waitress " and the new " your cover's blown " .
this ep became the band's third top *num* uk release , and the band was nominated for both the mercury music prize and an ivor novello award .
in january *num* , b&s was voted scotland's greatest band in a poll by the list , beating simple minds , idlewild , travis , franz ferdinand , and the proclaimers , among others .
in april *num* , members of the band visited israel and the palestinian territories with the uk charity war on want ; the group subsequently recorded a song inspired by the trip titled " the eighth station of the cross kebab house " , which would first appear on the digital-download version of the charity album and would later have a physical release as a b-side on 2006's " funny little frog " single .
" push barman to open old wounds " , a compilation of the jeepster singles and eps , was released in may *num* while the band were recording their seventh album in california .
the result of the sessions was " the life pursuit " , produced by tony hoffer .
the album , originally intended to be a double album , became the band's highest-charting album upon its release in february *num* , peaking at no .
*num* in the uk and no .
*num* on the us " billboard " *num* .
" funny little frog " , which preceded it , also proved to be their highest-charting single , debuting at no .
*num* .
on *num* july *num* , the band played a historic show with the los angeles philharmonic at the hollywood bowl .
the opening act at the *num* , *num* seat sell-out concert was the shins .
the members of the band see this as a landmark event , with stevie jackson saying , " this is the biggest thrill of my entire life " .
in october *num* , members of the band helped put together a cd collection of new songs for children titled " colours are brighter " , with the involvement of major bands such as franz ferdinand and the flaming lips .
on *num* november *num* the band released " the bbc sessions " , which features songs from the period of 1996–2001 ( including the last recordings featuring isobel campbell before she left the band ) , along with a second disc featuring a recording of a live performance in belfast from christmas *num* .
on *num* july *num* , the band performed their first uk gig in almost four years to a crowd of around *num* , *num* at latitude festival in henham park , southwold .
they performed two new songs , " i didn't see it coming " and " i'm not living in the real world " .
their eighth studio album , released in the uk and internationally on *num* september *num* , was titled " belle and sebastian write about love " .
the first single from the album , as well as the record's title track " write about love " , was released in the us on *num* september *num* .
" write about love " entered the uk albums chart in its first week of release , peaking at no .
*num* as of *num* october *num* .
norah jones is featured on the track " little lou , ugly jack , prophet john " .
in december *num* belle and sebastian curated the sequel to the " bowlie weekender " in the form of " bowlie *num* " presented by all tomorrow's parties .
in *num* , pitchfork tv released an hour-long documentary in february , directed by rj bentler which focused on the band's *num* album if you're feeling sinister , as well as the formation and early releases of the band .
the documentary featured interviews with every member that was present on the album , as well as several archival photos and videos from the band's early days .
the band compiled a second compilation album " the third eye centre " which included the b-sides and rarities released after " push barman to open old wounds " , from the albums " dear catastrophe waitress " , " the life pursuit " , and " write about love " .
in an interview at the end of *num* , mick cooke confirmed he had left the band on good terms .

branco river the branco river ( ; engl : " white river " ) is the principal affluent of the rio negro from the north .
the river drains the guayanan highlands moist forests ecoregion .
it is enriched by many streams from the tepui highlands which separate venezuela and guyana from brazil .
its two upper main tributaries are the uraricoera and the takutu .
the latter almost links its sources with those of the essequibo ; during floods headwaters of the branco and those of the essequibo are connected , allowing a level of exchange in the aquatic fauna ( such as fish ) between the two systems .
the branco flows nearly south , and finds its way into the negro through several channels and a chain of lagoons similar to those of the latter river .
it is long , up to its uraricoera confluence .
it has numerous islands , and , above its mouth , it is broken by a bad series of rapids .
as suggested by its name , the branco ( literally " white " in portuguese ) has whitish water that may appear almost milky due to the inorganic sediments it carries .
it is traditionally considered a whitewater river , although the major seasonal fluctuations in its physico-chemical characteristics makes a classification difficult and some consider it clearwater .
especially the river's upper parts at the headwaters are clear and flow through rocky country , leading to the suggestion that sediments mainly originate from the lower parts .
furthermore , its chemistry and color may contradict each other compared to the traditional amazonian river classifications .
the branco river has ph 6–7 and low levels of dissolved organic carbon .
alfred russel wallace mentioned the coloration in " on the rio negro " , a paper read at the *num* june *num* meeting of the royal geographical society , in which he said : " [ the rio branco ] is white to a remarkable degree , its waters being actually milky in appearance " .
alexander von humboldt attributed the color to the presence of silicates in the water , principally mica and talc .
there is a visible contrast with the waters of the rio negro at the confluence of the two rivers .
the rio negro is a blackwater river with dark tea-colored acidic water ( ph *num* .
5–4 .
*num* ) that contains high levels of dissolved organic carbon .
until approximately *num* , *num* years ago the headwaters of the branco river flowed not into the amazon , but via the takutu graben in the rupununi area of guyana towards the caribbean .
currently in the rainy season much of the rupununi area floods , with water draining both to the amazon ( via the branco river ) and the essequibo river .
galjoen the galjoen , black bream , or blackfish ( " dichistius capensis " ) is a species of marine fish found only along the coast of southern africa from angola to south africa .
galjoen is the national fish of south africa .
the galjoen is indigenous to the coasts of southern africa from angola to south africa , and is generally found around reefs at shallow depths around , often near the shore .
this species can reach in total length and a weight of .
the body is compressed , and the fins are well developed , with prominent spines , *num* of them , with between *num* and *num* rays .
the anal fin has three spines , and usually *num* or *num* rays , the pelvic fins have *num* spine and *num* rays , and the pectoral fins are typically shorter than the head .
the body , fins , and head , with the except of the front of the snout , are covered in scales .
the lips are thick , with strong curved incisors at the front of the mouth , with smaller teeth behind the front incisors .
the species usually feeds on red and coraline seaweed and red bait , small mussels and barnacles found off rocky shores , and appear in particular to be partial to the white mussels residing in the sandy beaches and inlets of the rocky outcrops along the southern coast .
in *num* , the movements of the species were extensively studied .
some *num* , *num* galjoen were tagged at four sites in reserves in south africa and it was concluded that their overall movement remained localised , with some *num* % of fish studied seeming to indicate a home area .
it is important to local commercial fisheries and is also popular as a game fish .
due to their abundance in the shores off south africa , galjoen is common in south african cuisine .
a notable dish is the fish is sprinkled with pepper and lemon , or with lemon , mayonnaise and melted garlic butter and served with fresh bread and apricot jam .
galjoen is the national fish of south africa .
the suggestion to make it the national fish came from margaret smith , wife of the ichthyologist j .
l .
b .
smith , to find a marine equivalent to the springbok .
the scientific name of " coracinus capensis " is a reference to its black colour when found in rocky areas , " coracinus " meaning " raven " or " black coloured " ; in sandy areas it gives off a silver-bronze colour .
abd al-rahman iii abd al-rahman iii ( " ′abd al-rahmān ibn muhammad ibn ′abd allāh ibn muhammad ibn ′abd al-rahman ibn al-hakam al-rabdi ibn hisham ibn ′abd al-rahman al-dakhil " ; ; *num* january *num* / *num* october *num* ) was an arab emir and caliph of córdoba ( 912–961 ) of the umayyad dynasty in al-andalus .
called " al-nasir li-din allah " ( " the defender of god's faith " ) , he ascended the throne in his early 20s and reigned for half a century as the most powerful prince of iberia .
although people of all creeds enjoyed tolerance and freedom of religion under his rule , he repelled the fatimids , partly by supporting their maghrawa enemies in north africa , and partly by claiming the title caliph ( ruler of the islamic world ) for himself .
abd al-rahman was born in córdoba , the grandson of abdullah ibn muhammad al-umawi , seventh independent umayyad emir of al-andalus .
his parents were abdullah's son muhammad and muzna ( or muzayna ) , a christian concubine .
his paternal grandmother was also a christian , the royal infanta onneca fortúnez , daughter of the captive king fortún garcés of pamplona .
abd al-rahman was thus nephew in the half-blood of queen toda of pamplona .
he is described as having " white skin , blue eyes and attractive face ; good looking , although somewhat sturdy and stout .
his legs were short , to the point that the stirrups of his saddle were mounted just one palm under it .
when mounted , he looked tall , but on his feet he was quite short .
he dyed his beard black .
muhammad was assassinated by his brother al-mutarrif , who had allegedly grown jealous of the favour muhammad had gained in the eyes of their father abdallah .
al-mutarrif had accused muhammad of plotting with the rebel umar ibn hafsun , and muhammad had been imprisoned .
according to some sources , the emir himself was behind muhammad's fall , as well as al-mutarrif's death in *num* .
abd al-rahman spent his youth in his mother's harem .
al-mutarrif's sister , known as " al-sayyida " ( " the lady " ) , was entrusted with his education .
she made sure that abd al-rahman's education was conducted with some rigor .
emir abdallah died at the age of *num* .
despite the fact that four of his sons ( aban , abd al rahman , muhammad and ahmad ) were alive at the time of his death , all of them were passed over for succession .
abdallah instead chose as his successor his grandson , abd al-rahman iii ( the son of his first son ) .
this came as no surprise , since abdallah had already demonstrated his affection for his grandson in many ways , namely by allowing him to live in his own tower ( something he did not allow for any of his sons ) , and allowing him to sit on the throne on some festive occasions .
most importantly abdallah gave abd al-rahman his ring , the symbol of power , when abdallah fell ill prior to his death .
abd al-rahman succeeded abdallah the day after his death , *num* october *num* .
historiographers of the time , such as " al-bayan al-mughrib " and the " crónica anónima de abd al-rahman iii " , state that his succession was " without incident " .
at the time , abd al-rahman was about *num* or *num* years old .
he inherited an emirate on the verge of dissolution , his power extending not far beyond the vicinity of córdoba .
to the north , the christian kingdom of asturias was continuing its program of " reconquista " in the douro valley .
to the south in ifriqiya , the fatimids had created an independent caliphate that threatened to attract the allegiance of the muslim population , who had suffered under the harsh rule of abdullah .
on the internal front the discontented muladi families ( muslims of iberian origin ) represented a constant danger for the córdoban emir .
the most powerful of the latter was umar ibn hafsun , who , from his impregnable fortress of umar ibn hafsun , controlled much of eastern al-andalus .
from the very early stages of his reign , abd al-rahman showed a firm resolve to quash the rebels of al-andalus , consolidate centralized power , and reestablish internal order within the emirate .
within *num* days of taking the throne , he exhibited the head of a rebel leader in cordoba .
from this point on he led annual expeditions against the northern and southern tribes to maintain control over them .
to accomplish his aims he introduced into the court the " saqalibah " , slaves of east european origin .
the " saqalibah " represented a third ethnic group that could neutralize the endless strife between his subjects of muslim arab heritage , and those of muslim berber heritage .
hasdai ibn shaprut , a jewish courtier of the king's court who served as financier to the king , wrote of the king's revenues on this wise : during the first *num* years of his rule , abd al-rahman avoided military action against the northern christian kingdoms , asturias and the kingdom of navarre .
the muladi rebels were the first problem he confronted .
those powerful families were supported by iberians who were openly or secretly christians and had acted with the rebels .
these elements , which formed the bulk of the population , were not averse to supporting a strong ruler who would protect them against the arab aristocracy .
abd al-rahman moved to subdue them by means of a mercenary army that included christians .
he first had to suppress the rebel umar ibn hafsun .
on *num* january *num* an army , led by the eunuch badr , conquered the fortress of écija , at some from the capital .
all the city's fortifications were destroyed , aside from the citadel , which was left as residence of the governor and a garrison for the emiral troops .
in the following spring , after sixty-five days of meticulous preparations , abd al-rahman personally led an expedition to the south of his realm .
his troops were able to recover the " coras " ( provinces ) of jaén and granada , while a cavalry detachment was sent to free málaga from ibn hafsun's siege .
he also obtained the capitulation of fiñana ( in the modern province of almería ) , after setting fire to its suburbs .
subsequently , he moved against the castle of juviles in the alpujarras .
after devastating its countryside to deprive it of any resource , he encircled it .
finding it difficult to bombard with catapults , he ordered the construction of a platform where his siege engines could be mounted to greater effect , and cut the water supply .
the muladi defenders surrendered after a few days : their lives , apart from fifty-five die-hards who were beheaded , were spared in exchange of their allegiance to the emir .
the campaign continued in a similar vein , lasting for a total of ninety days .
abd al-rahman forced the defeated muladi to send hostages and treasures to córdoba , in order to secure their continued submission .
in the first year of his reign , abd al-rahman took advantage of the rivalries between the banu hayyay lords of seville and carmona to force them to submit .
he initially sent a special corps ( " hasam " ) under ahmad ibn muhammad ibn hudayr , governor of écija , to seville , to obtain their submission .
this attempt failed , but gained him the support of muhammad ibn ibrahim ibn hayyay , lord of carmona , and a cousin of the sevillan lord , ahmad ibn maslama .
when the latter was surrounded by umayyad troops , he sued for help to ibn hafsun , but the latter was defeated by the besiegers and returned to bobastro .
he next went after the forts in the provinces of elvira , granada , and jaen , all of which were either directly or indirectly controlled by hafsun .
seville finally capitulated on *num* december *num* .
ibn al-mundir al-qurays , a member of the royal family , was named governor of the city , while the lord of carmona obtained the title of vizier .
muhammad ibn ibrahim enjoyed his office for only a single day , for abd al-rahman soon discovered his collusion with the rebel governor of carmona .
muhammad was sent to prison , where he later met his death .
the region of valencia submitted peacefully in *num* .
abd al-rahman's next objective was to quash the longstanding rebellion of umar ibn hafsun .
his troops left córdoba on *num* may *num* and , after a few days , encamped before the walls of balda ( identified with today's cuevas de san marcos ) .
his cavalry ravaged the nearby woods and the countryside , while the rest of the troopes moved to turrus , a castle located in the present municipality of algarinejo , which was surrounded within five days , while its environs were also devastated .
the umayyad army then moved to the citadel of umar ibn hafsun , while the cavalry was sent to the castle of sant batir , which was abandoned by the defenders , allowing abd al-rahman's troops to secure a large booty .
then it was the turn of the castles of olías and reina .
the latter fell after a violent fight , leaving the road open to the major city and provincial capital of málaga , which he captured after one day .
abd al-rahman then turned and followed the coast by montemayor , near benahavís , suhayl ( fuengirola ) and another castle called " turrus " or " turrus jusayn " ( identified by évariste lévi-provençal as ojén ) .
he finally arrived at algeciras on *num* june *num* .
he ordered a patrol of the coast to destroy the boats that supplied the citadel of umar ibn hafsun from the maghreb .
many of them were captured and set afire in front of the emir .
the rebellious castles near algeciras surrendered as soon as the cordoban army manifested itself .
abd al-rahman launched three different campaigns against ibn hafsun ( who died in *num* ) and his sons .
among them , jafar ibn hafsun held the stronghold of toledo .
abd al-rahman ordered ravaged the city's countryside .
jafar , after two years of siege , escaped the city to ask for help in the northern christian kingdoms .
in the meantime abd al-rahman obtained the surrender of the city from its population , after promising them immunity , although *num* , *num* rebel men escaped in a night sally .
the city surrendered on *num* august *num* , after a siege of two years .
in *num* the banu muhallab of guadix submitted , followed by those of jerez de la frontera and cádiz , as well as the trading republic of pechina ( *num* ) .
in *num* , abd al-rahman also launched a campaign against the rebel banu qasi , but was forced to break it off by the intervention of jimeno garcés of pamplona .
the last of ibn hafsun to fall was hafs , who commanded his powerful fortress of umar ibn hafsun .
surrounded by abd al-rahman's vizier said ibn al-mundhir who had ordered the construction of bastions around the city , he resisted the siege for six months , until he surrendered in *num* and had his life spared .
the continued expeditions against the hafsunids did not distract abd ad-rahman iii from the situation of other regions in al-andalus , which recognized him only nominally , if not being in open revolt .
most of the loyal governors of the cities were in a weak position , such as the governor of évora , who could not prevent the attack of the king of galicia ( future king of león ) , ordoño ii , who captured the city in the summer of *num* , taking back a sizable booty and *num* , *num* prisoners and massacring many muslims .
in much of the eastern and western province , abd al-rahman's authority was completely unrecognized .
the lord of badajoz , abd allah ibn muhammad , grandson of abd al-rahman ibn marwan al-yilliqi , not only fortified his city against a possible attack from ordoño , but also acted in complete independence from córdoba .
to avoid the fall of évora into the hands of the berber groups of the region , he ordered the destruction of its defensive towers and lowered the walls , though a year later he decided to reconstruct it , giving its control to his ally masud ibn sa ' dun al-surunbaqi .
the algarve was dominated completely by a muladí coalition led by sa'id ibn mal , who had expelled the arabs from beja , and the lords of ocsónoba , yahya ibn bakr , and of niebla , ibn ufayr .
alcácer do sal and lisbon were under control of the banu dānis .
the absence of royal authority enabled ordoño ii to easily campaign in this area , his main objective being the city of mérida , in the summer of *num* .
abd al-rahman iii did not send an army and only several local berber " jefes " offered some resistance which was ineffective .
in the next year , despite having defeated only some of the rebels , abd al-rahman iii considered himself powerful enough to declare himself caliph of córdoba ( *num* january *num* ) , effectively breaking his allegiance to , and ties with , the fatimid and abbasid caliphs .
the caliphate was thought only to belong to the emperor who ruled over the sacred cities of mecca and medina , and his ancestors had until then been content with the title of emir .
but the force of this tradition had weakened over time ; and the title increased abd al-rahman's prestige with his subjects , both in iberia and africa .
he based his claim to the caliphate on his umayyad ancestors who had held undisputed control of the caliphate until they were overthrown by the abbasids .
abd al-rahman's move made him both the political and the religious leader of all the muslims in al-andalus , as well as the protector of his christian and jewish subjects .
the symbols of his new caliphate power were a scepter ( " jayzuran " ) and the throne ( " sarir " ) .
in the mint he had founded in november *num* , abd al-rahman started to mint gold dinars and silver dirhams , replacing the " al-andalus " title with his name .
in his new role of caliph , he achieved the surrender of ibn marwan of badajoz in *num* as well as the surrender of the banu dānis of alcácer do sal .
on the southern front , to counter the increasing fatimid power in north africa , abd al-rahmad ordered the construction of a fleet based in almeria .
the caliph helped the maghrawa berbers conquer melilla ( *num* ) , ceuta ( *num* ) and tangiers ( *num* ) , which accepted his suzerainty .
however , he was unable to defeat jawhar al-siqilli of the fatamids .
in *num* he signed a peace with the new king of león , ordoño iii , in order to have a free hand against the fatimids whose ships were harassing the caliphate ones in the mediterranean and had even launched an assault against almeria .
abd al-rahman's force , led by prime minister ahmad ibn said , besieged the fatimid port of tunis , which bought its safety through paying a huge sum .
in the end he was able to create a protectorate covering the northern and central maghreb , supporting the idrisid dynasty ; the caliphate influence in the area disappeared after a fatimid offensive in *num* , after which abd al-rahman kept only the strongholds of ceuta and tangiers .
even before al-andalus was firmly under his rule , he had restarted the war against king ordoño ii of león , who had taken advantage of the previous troublesome situation to capture some boundary areas and menace the umayyad territory .
in *num* the then emir had sent a large army under his general ahmad ibn abi abda against león , but this force was destroyed at the battle of san esteban de gormaz in september of that year .
recognizing he had underestimated the power of ordoño ii , in *num* abd al-rahman mustered another powerful army to reclaim the territories lost after the previous campaign .
he captured the forts of osma and san esteban de gormaz .
after defeating king sancho garcés i of navarre and the king of leon at valdejunquera on *num* july , he penetrated into navarre , overcoming aragon by the classic route of the invasions from the south .
abd al-rahman reached the basque city of pamplona , which was sacked and its cathedral church demolished .
in *num* abd al-rahman felt obliged to avenge the massacre of viguera castle perpetrated by king sancho ordóñez of navarre one year earlier .
he launched counter offensive against sancho in which abd al-rahman devastated a large area of basque territory .
the succession crisis which struck león after ordoño ii's death in the same year caused hostilities to cease until ramiro ii obtained the throne in *num* ; a first attempt by him to assist the besieged rebels in toledo was repelled in *num* , despite the christian king capturing madrid and scoring a victory at osma .
in *num* , after reasserting supremacy over pamplona and álava , abd al-rahmad forced ramiro to retreat to burgos , and forced the navarrese queen toda , his aunt , to submit to him as a vassal and withdraw from direct rule as regent for her son garcía sánchez i .
in *num* abd al-rahmad conquered some thirty castles in león .
next he turned to muhammad ibn hashim al-tugib , governor of zaragoza , who had allied with ramiro but was pardoned after the capture of his city .
despite early defeats , ramiro and garcía were able to crush the caliphate army in *num* at the battle of simancas , and almost kill abd al-rahman , due , most likely , to treason by arab elements in the caliph's army .
after this defeat , abd al-rahman stopped taking personal command of his military campaigns .
his cause was helped , however , by fernán gonzález of castile , one of the christian leaders at simancas , who subsequently launched a sustained rebellion against ramiro .
the victory of simancas enabled the christian kingdom to maintain the military initiative in the peninsula until the defeat of ramiro's successor , ordoño iii of león , in *num* .
however they did not press this advantage as civil war broke out in the christian territories .
in *num* abd al-rahman received in córdoba an embassy from count borrell ii of barcelona , by which the northern county recognized caliphate supremacy in exchange for peace and mutual support .
in *num* , sancho , the exiled king of leon , garcia sanchez , king of navarre , and queen toda all paid homage to abd al-rahman in cordoba .
until *num* , the caliphate played an active role in the dynastic strife characterizing the christian kingdom during the period .
ordoño iii's half-brother and successor , sancho the fat , had been deposed by his cousin ordoño iv .
together with his grandmother toda of navarre , sancho sought an alliance with córdoba .
in exchange for some castles , abd al-rahman helped them to take back zamora ( *num* ) and oviedo ( *num* ) and to overthrow ordoño iv .
abd al-rahman was accused of having sunk in his later years into the self-indulgent habits of the harem .
he is known to have openly kept a male as well as a female harem .
this likely influenced the polemical story of his falling in love with a 13-year-old boy ( later enshrined as a christian martyr and canonised as saint pelagius of córdoba ) who refused the caliph's advances .
the love story may have been a construct on top of an original tale , however , in which he ordered the boy-slave to convert to islam .
either way , enraged , he had the boy tortured and dismembered , thus contributing to the christian perception of muslim brutality .
abd al-rahman spent the rest of his years in his new palace outside córdoba .
he died in october *num* and was succeeded by his son al-hakam ii .
abd al-rahman was a great humanist and patron of arts , especially architecture .
a third of his revenue sufficed for the ordinary expenses of government , a third was hoarded , and a third was spent on buildings .
after declaring the caliphate , he had a massive palace complex , known as the medina azahara , built some five kilometers north of córdoba .
the medina azahara was modeled after the old umayyad palace in damascus and served as a symbolic tie between the new caliph and his ancestors .
it was said that cordoba contained *num* mosques and *num* , *num* shops and homes during his reign .
under his reign , córdoba became the most important intellectual centre of western europe .
he expanded the city's library , which would be further enriched by his successors .
he also reinforced the iberian fleet , which became the most powerful in mediterranean europe .
iberian raiders moved up to galicia , asturias , and north africa .
the colonizers of fraxinetum came from al-andalus as well .
due to his consolidation of power , muslim iberia became a power for a few centuries .
it also brought prosperity , and with this he created mints where pure gold and silver coins were created .
he renovated and added to the mosque–cathedral of córdoba .
he was very wary of losing control and kept tight reins in his family .
in *num* , he executed one of his sons for conspiring against him .
he was tolerant of non-muslims , jews and christians who were treated fairly .
european nations sent emissaries such as from otto i of germany , and the byzantine emperor .
abd al-rahman iii's mother muzna was a christian captive , possibly from the pyrenean region .
his paternal grandmother onneca fortúnez was a christian princess from the kingdom of pamplona .
in his immediate ancestry , abd al-rahman iii was arab and hispano–basque .
gangsta rap gangsta rap or gangster rap is a style of hip hop characterized by themes and lyrics that generally emphasize the " gangsta " lifestyle .
the genre evolved from hardcore hip hop into a distinct form , pioneered in the mid-1980s by rappers such as schoolly d and ice-t , and was popularized in the later part of the 1980s by groups like n .
w .
a .
after the national attention that ice-t and n .
w .
a attracted in the late 1980s and early 1990s , gangsta rap became the most commercially lucrative subgenre of hip hop .
many ( if not most ) gangsta rap artists openly boast of their associations with various active street gangs as part of their artistic image , with the crips and bloods being the most commonly represented .
gangsta rap parallels other indigenous gang and crime-oriented forms of music , such as the narcocorrido genre of northern mexico .
the subject matter inherent in gangsta rap has caused a great deal of controversy .
criticism has come from both left-wing and right-wing commentators , as well as religious leaders , who have accused the genre of promoting crime , serial killing , murder , violence , profanity , sex addiction , homophobia , racism , promiscuity , misogyny , rape , street gangs , disorderly conduct , drive-by shootings , vandalism , theft , driving under the influence , drug dealing , alcohol abuse , substance abuse , disregarding law enforcement , materialism , and narcissism .
the white house administrations of both george h .
w .
bush and bill clinton criticized the genre .
" many black rappers—including ice-t and sister souljah—contend that they are being unfairly singled out because their music reflects deep changes in society not being addressed anywhere else in the public forum .
the white politicians , the artists complain , neither understand the music nor desire to hear what's going on in the devastated communities that gave birth to the art form , " wrote journalist chuck philips in a review of the battle between " the establishment " and defenders of rap music .
" the reason why rap is under attack is because it exposes all the contradictions of american culture .
.
.
what started out as an underground art form has become a vehicle to expose a lot of critical issues that are not usually discussed in american politics .
the problem here is that the white house and wanna-bes like bill clinton represent a political system that never intends to deal with inner city urban chaos , " sister souljah told philips .
on the other hand , some commentators ( for example , spike lee in his satirical film " bamboozled " ) have criticized gangsta rap as analogous to black minstrel shows and blackface performance , in which performers – both black and white – were made to look african american , and acted in a stereotypical uncultured and ignorant manner for entertainment .
gangsta rappers often defend themselves by arguing they are describing the reality of inner-city life , and that they are only adopting a character which behaves in ways they do not necessarily endorse .
gangsta rappers are also famous ( or infamous ) for appearing more hardcore compared to early concepts and themes of hip-hop artists , and are known for saying things that are often considered taboo ; for instance , the gangsta rap group n .
w .
a produced the famous " fuck tha police " protest song about police brutality and racial profiling .
in high-crime areas , putting on these made up personas is life-threatening , but the fact that gangsta rappers told the stories of others is often seen as having earned them respect for raising awareness of the severity of inner-city crime .
many gangsta rappers argue that in the world of their genre exists the emotions and perspectives of a people whose suffering is too often overlooked and belittled by society .
gangsta rap , some argue , was an effect of the various wrongdoings perpetrated against african-americans in underprivileged neighborhoods .
the various riots sparked by the rodney king beating and the acquittal of the police officers responsible for the beating sparked anger and outrage in an area that was already at risk .
gangsta rap acted as an outlet so such people could express themselves angrily and not in fear that they were going to be silenced for telling the truth .
they often used gangsta rap to tell the stories of their lives , which sometimes included strong violence , hypersexuality , and drug abuse .
tracy " ice-t " morrow , was born in newark , new jersey , in *num* .
as a teenager , he moved to los angeles where he rose to prominence in the west coast hip hop scene .
in *num* , ice-t released " *num* in the mornin' " , which is often regarded as among the first gangsta rap songs .
ice-t had been mcing since the early ' 80s , but first turned to gangsta rap themes after being influenced by philadelphia rapper schoolly d and his *num* album " schoolly d " , often considered to be the originator of gangsta rap .
in an interview with props magazine , ice-t said : in *num* , ice-t repeated in his autobiography that schoolly d was his inspiration for gangsta rap .
ice-t continued to release gangsta albums for the remainder of the 1980s : " rhyme pays " in *num* , " power " in *num* , and " the iceberg / freedom of speech .
.
.
just watch what you say " in *num* .
ice-t's lyrics also contained strong political commentary , and often played the line between glorifying the gangsta lifestyle and criticizing it as a no-win situation .
schoolly d's debut album , " schoolly d " , and especially the song " p .
s .
k .
what does it mean ? " , would heavily influence not only ice-t , but also eazy-e and n .
w .
a ( most notably in the song " boyz-n-the-hood " ) as well as the beastie boys on their seminal hardcore hip hop-influenced album " licensed to ill " ( *num* ) .
boogie down productions released their first single , " say no brother ( crack attack don't do it ) " , in *num* .
it was followed by " south-bronx / p is free " and " 9mm goes bang " in the same year .
the latter is the most gangsta-themed song of the three ; in it , krs-one boasts about shooting a crack dealer and his posse to death ( in self-defense ) .
the album " criminal minded " followed in *num* , and was the first rap album to have firearms on its cover .
shortly after the release of this album , bdp's dj , scott larock was shot and killed .
after this , bdp's subsequent records were more focused with the inadequate rationale removed .
the first blockbuster gangsta rap album was n .
w .
a's " straight outta compton " , released in *num* .
" straight outta compton " would establish west coast hip hop as a vital genre , and establish los angeles as a legitimate rival to hip hop's long-time capital , new york city .
" straight outta compton " sparked the first major controversy regarding hip hop lyrics when their song " fuck tha police " earned a letter from fbi assistant director , milt ahlerich , strongly expressing law enforcement's resentment of the song .
due to the influence of ice-t , n .
w .
a , and ice cube's early solo career , gangsta rap is often somewhat erroneously credited as being a mostly west coast phenomenon , despite the contributions of east coast acts like boogie down productions in shaping the genre and despite philadelphia rapper schoolly d being generally regarded as the first gangsta rapper .
in the early 1990s , former n .
w .
a member ice cube would further influence gangsta rap with his hardcore , socio-political solo albums , which suggested the potential of gangsta rap as a political medium to give voice to inner-city youth .
n .
w .
a's second album , " efil4zaggin " ( *num* ) ( released after ice cube's departure from the group ) , broke ground as the first gangsta rap album to reach #1 on the billboard pop charts .
aside from n .
w .
a and ice t , too short ( from oakland , california ) , kid frost , and the south gate-based latino group cypress hill were pioneering west coast rappers with gangsta rap songs and themes .
above the law also played an important role in the gangsta rap movement , as their *num* debut album " livin ' like hustlers " , as well as their guest appearance on n .
w .
a's *num* " efil4zaggin " , foreshadowing the dominance of the genre in 1990s starting with dr .
dre's " the chronic " .
the beastie boys were one of the first groups to identify themselves as " gangsters " , and one of the first popular rap groups to talk about violence and drug and alcohol use , though largely in a more humorous manner .
they had started out as a hardcore punk band , but after introduction to producer rick rubin and the exit of kate schellenbach they became a rap group .
according to " rolling stone " magazine , their *num* album " licensed to ill " is " filled with enough references to guns , drugs , and empty sex ( including the pornographic deployment of a wiffleball bat in " paul revere " ) to qualify as a gangsta-rap cornerstone .
" the beasties ' *num* album " paul's boutique " included the similarly themed tracks " car thief , " " looking down the barrel of a gun , " and " high-plains drifter .
" in *num* , the los angeles-based group c .
i .
a .
rapped over beastie boy tracks for songs such as " my posse " and " ill-legal " , and the beastie boys ' influence can be seen significantly in n .
w .
a's early albums .
the new york rap group run dmc is often credited with popularizing hardcore and confrontational attitudes and lyrics in hip hop culture , and were one of the first rap groups to dress in gang-like street clothing .
their stripped-down , rock-inspired beats were also important in establishing the early gangsta rap production style .
the seminal long island-based group public enemy featured aggressive , politically charged lyrics , which had an especially strong influence on gangsta rappers such as ice cube .
east coast hardcore rappers like rakim , kool g rap , big daddy kane , slick rick , ll cool j , and epmd also reflected the trend in hip-hop music in the late 1980s towards hard-hitting , angry , aggressive , and politically conscious lyrics , revolving around crime , violence , poverty , war and gunplay .
the houston-based group known as the geto boys came out around the late 1980s and made songs containing both gangsta themes of crime and violence and sociopolitical commentary .
the group notably released proto-mafioso rap music with the song " scarface " , a track centered on selling cocaine and killing rival gang members .
the geto boys are also known for being the first rap group to sample from the movie " scarface " , a film which became the basis for various mafioso rap samples in the 1990s .
furthermore , the geto boys , along with jam master j's and erick sermon's group flatlinerz and prince paul's and rza's group gravediggaz , are often cited as pioneers of " horrorcore " rap , a transgressive and abrasive subgenre of hardcore rap or gangsta rap which focuses on common horror themes , such as the supernatural and the occult , often with gothic or macabre lyrics , satanic imagery , and slasher film or splatter film-like violence .
ice-t released one of the seminal albums of the genre , " " in *num* .
it also contained a song by his new thrash metal group body count , who released a self titled album in *num* .
particular controversy surrounded one of its songs " cop killer " .
the rock song was intended to speak from the viewpoint of a police target seeking revenge on racist , brutal cops .
ice-t's rock song infuriated government officials , the national rifle association and various police advocacy groups .
consequently , time warner music refused to release ice-t's upcoming album " home invasion " and dropped ice-t from the label .
ice-t suggested that the furor over the song was an overreaction , telling journalist chuck philips " .
.
.
they've done movies about nurse killers and teacher killers and student killers .
arnold schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the terminator .
but i don't hear anybody complaining about that .
" in the same interview , ice-t suggested to philips that the misunderstanding of " cop killer " , the misclassification of it as a rap song ( not a rock song ) , and the attempts to censor it had racial overtones : " the supreme court says it's ok for a white man to burn a cross in public .
but nobody wants a black man to write a record about a cop killer .
" ice-t's next album , " home invasion " was postponed as a result of the controversy , and was finally released in *num* .
while it contained gangsta elements , it was his most political album to date .
after a proposed censoring of the " home invasion " album cover art , he left warner bros .
records .
ice-t's subsequent releases went back to straight gangsta-ism , but were never as popular as his earlier releases .
he had alienated his core audience with his involvement in metal , his emphasis on politics and with his uptempo bomb-squad style beats during a time when g-funk was popular .
he published a book " the ice opinion : who gives a @# ! * % ? " in *num* .
in *num* , former n .
w .
a member dr .
dre released " the chronic " , a massive seller ( eventually going triple platinum ) which showed that explicit gangsta rap could hold mass commercial appeal just like more pop-oriented rappers such as mc hammer , the fresh prince , and tone lōc .
the album established the dominance of west coast gangsta rap and dre's new post-n .
w .
a label , death row records ( owned by dr .
dre along with marion " suge " knight ) , as dre's album showcased a stable of promising new death row rappers .
the album also began the subgenre of g-funk , a slow , drawled form of hip hop that dominated the rap charts for some time .
extensively sampling p-funk bands , especially parliament and funkadelic , g-funk was multi-layered , yet simple and easy to dance to .
the simple message of its lyrics , that life's problems could be overcome by guns , alcohol , and marijuana , endeared it to a teenage audience .
the single " nuthin ' but a " g " thang " became a crossover hit , with its humorous , " house party"-influenced video becoming an mtv staple despite that network's historic orientation towards rock music .
another success was ice cube's " predator " album , released at about the same time as " the chronic " in *num* .
it sold over *num* million copies and was #1 in the charts , propelled by the hit single " it was a good day " , despite the fact that ice cube was not a death row artist .
one of the genre's biggest crossover stars was dre's protégé snoop doggy dogg ( " doggystyle " ) , whose exuberant , party-oriented themes made songs such as " gin and juice " club anthems and top hits nationwide .
in *num* , 2pac signed with death row and released the multi-platinum double album " all eyez on me " .
not long afterward , his shocking murder brought gangsta rap into the national headlines and propelled his posthumous " " album ( released under the alias " makaveli " ) ( which eerily featured an image of 2pac being crucified on the front cover ) to the top of the charts .
warren g was another g-funk musician along with the now deceased nate dogg .
other successful g-funk influenced artists included spice *num* , mc eiht and mc ren , all of them reaching decent positions on the billboard *num* , in spite of not being associated with death row .
mafioso rap is a hardcore hip hop subgenre founded by kool g rap in the late 1980s .
it is the pseudo-mafia extension of east coast hardcore rap , and is considered the counterpart of west coast g-funk rap .
mafioso rap is characterized by references to famous mobsters and mafiosi , racketeering , and organized crime in general ( but especially the italian-american mafia , the sicilian mafia , african-american organized crime , and latin american organized crime or drug cartels ) .
though some mafioso rap was more gritty and street-oriented , many other mafioso rap artists frequently focused on lavish , self-indulgent , materialistic , and luxurious subject matter , such as expensive drugs , cars , and expensive champagne .
though the genre died down for several years , it re-emerged in *num* when wu-tang clan member raekwon released his critically acclaimed solo album , " only built *num* cuban linx .
.
.
" .
*num* also saw the release of " doe or die " by nas ' protégé az and the release of the album " *num* , *num* , *num* " by subgenre originator kool g rap .
this album featured other mafioso rap artists mf grimm , nas and b-1 .
these three albums brought the genre to mainstream recognition , and inspired other east coast artists , such as jay-z , notorious b .
i .
g .
and nas , to adopt the same themes as well with their albums " reasonable doubt " , " life after death " and " it was written " ( respectively ) .
though mafioso rap declined in the mainstream by the late 1990s , it saw somewhat of a revival in the mid 2000s with ghostface killah's " fishscale " , jay-z's " american gangster " , and raekwon's " only built *num* cuban linx .

similarly , in recent years , many rappers , such as t .
i .
, rick ross , fabolous , jadakiss , jim jones ( rapper ) , and cassidy have maintained popularity with lyrics about self-centered urban criminal lifestyles or " hustling " .
lil ' kim's mafioso album " la bella mafia " , released in *num* , was a commercial success , receiving platinum certification .
meanwhile , rappers from new york city , such as wu-tang clan , onyx , big l , mobb deep , nas , the notorious b .

, lil ' kim , and the l .

in *num* , both nas and the notorious b .
i .
g .
released their debut albums " illmatic " and " ready to die " respectively , which paved the way for new york city to take back dominance from the west coast .
in an interview for " the independent " in *num* , the wu-tang clan's gza commented on the term " gangsta rap " and its association with his group's music and hip hop at the time : it is widely speculated that the ensuing " east coast / west coast " battle between death row records and bad boy records resulted in the deaths of death row records ' 2pac and bad boy records ' the notorious b .
i .
g .
even before the murders , death row had begun to unravel , as co-founder dr .
dre had left earlier in *num* ; in the aftermath of 2pac's death , label owner suge knight was sentenced to prison for a parole violation , and death row proceeded to sink quickly as most of its remaining artists , including snoop dogg , left .
dr .
dre , at the mtv video music awards , claimed that " gangsta rap was dead " .
while puff daddy's bad boy entertainment fared better than its west coast rival , it eventually began to lose popularity and support by the end of the decade , due to its pursuit of a more mainstream sound , as well as challenges from atlanta and new orleans-based labels , especially , master p's no limit stable of popular rappers .
after the deaths of tupac shakur and biggie smalls and the media attention the murders generated , gangsta rap became an even greater commercial force .
however , most of the industry's major labels were in turmoil , bankrupt , or creatively stagnant , and new labels representing the rap scenes in new locations sprang up .
master p's no limit records label , based out of new orleans , became quite popular in the late 1990s , though critical success was very scarce , with the exceptions of some later additions like mystikal ( " ghetto fabulous " , *num* ) .
no limit had begun its rise to national popularity with master p's " the ghetto is trying to kill me ! " ( *num* ) , and had major hits with silkk the shocker ( " charge it *num* da game " , *num* ) and c-murder ( " life or death " , *num* ) .
cash money records , also based out of new orleans , had enormous commercial success beginning in the late 1990s with a similar musical style but utilized a quality-over-quantity business approach unlike no limit .
memphis collective hypnotize minds , led by three *num* mafia and project pat , have taken gangsta rap to some of its darker extremes .
led by in-house producers dj paul and juicy j , the label became known for its pulsating , menacing beats and uncompromisingly thuggish lyrics .
however , in the mid-2000s , the group began attaining more mainstream popularity , eventually culminating in the three *num* mafia winning an academy award for the song " it's hard out here for a pimp " from " hustle and flow " .
midwest gangsta rap originated in the mid-1990s and rose to major prominence in the 2000s .
however , in the 2010s a new form of gangsta rap known as drill emerged from the midwest .
drill gained popularity by rappers such as lil durk , chief keef , lil reese , and lil herb .
midwest hip hop was originally distinctive for its faster-paced flow .
this is evident in the styles of the earliest midwestern rappers to release albums , chicago's twista and cleveland's bone thugs-n-harmony .
bone thugs , known for their fast , harmonizing vocals coupled with an ultra-quick rap delivery , would achieve major success with their critically acclaimed *num* album " e *num* eternal " , which featured a major hit in the grammy-winning " tha crossroads " .
houston first came on to the national scene in the late 1980s with the violent and disturbing stories told by the geto boys , with member scarface achieving major solo success in the mid-90s .
the chopped and screwed genre was developed in houston , texas which remains the location most associated with the style .
the late dj screw , a south houston dj , is credited with the creation of and early experimentation with the genre .
dj screw began making mixtapes of the slowed-down music in the early 1990s and began the screwed up click .
this provided a significant outlet for mcs in the south-houston area , and helped local rappers such as big moe , lil ' flip , e .
s .
g .
, ugk , lil ' keke , south park mexican , spice *num* and z-ro gain regional and sometimes national prominence .
narco-rap is a music scene , similar to the early underground gangsta-rap scene , that emerged in northeastern mexico and southern texas .
its lyrical content , popular among latino youth , is violent and focuses on the power of drug cartels and the gruesomeness of the drug war in the border region .
narco-rap emerged in the urban area of tamaulipas , a turf currently under armed dispute between the zetas and the gulf cartel .
narco-rappers sing about the life of mobsters and the reality of the cities under the cartel's rule .
some of the key players of the genre are cano y blunt , dement and big los .
before the late 1990s , gangsta rap , while a huge-selling genre , had been regarded as well outside of the pop mainstream , committed to representing the experience of the inner-city and not " selling out " to the pop charts .
however , the rise of bad boy records , propelled by the massive crossover success of bad boy head sean " puffy " combs's *num* ensemble album , " no way out " , on the heels of the media attention generated by the murders of 2pac and the notorious b .
i .
g .
, signaled a major stylistic change in gangsta rap ( or as it is referred to on the east coast , hardcore rap ) , as it morphed into a new subgenre of hip hop which would become even more commercially successful and popularly accepted .
the earlier , somewhat controversial crossover success enjoyed by popular gangsta rap songs like " gin and juice " gave way to gangsta rap's becoming a widely accepted staple on the pop charts in the late 1990s .
for example , between the release of the notorious b .
i .
g .
' s debut album " ready to die " in *num* and his follow-up , the posthumous " life after death " in *num* , his sound changed from a darker , tense production , with lyrics projecting desperation and paranoia , to a cleaner , more laid-back sound , fashioned for popular consumption ( though the references to guns , drug dealing and life as a thug on the street remained ) .
r&b-styled hooks and instantly recognizable samples of well-known soul and pop songs from the 1970s and 1980s were the staples of this sound , which was showcased primarily in sean " puffy " combs's latter-day production work for the notorious b .
i .
g .
( " mo money , mo problems " ) , mase ( " feels so good " ) , and non-bad boy artists such as jay-z ( " can i get a .
.
.
" ) and nas ( " street dreams " ) .
also achieving similar levels of success with a similar sound at the same time as bad boy was master p and his no limit label in new orleans , as well as the new orleans upstart cash money label .
many of the artists who achieved such mainstream success in the 2000s , such as jay-z , dmx , then *num* cent and g-unit , originated from the gritty 1990s east coast rap scene and were influenced by hardcore artists such as the notorious b .
i .
g .
, wu-tang clan , and nas .
mase and cam'ron were typical of a more relaxed , casual flow that became the pop-gangsta norm .
by contrast , other rappers like eminem and dmx enjoyed commercial success in the late 1990s by rapping about ever-more macabre tales of death and violence , maintaining commercial relevance by attempting to be controversial and subversive , growing on the horrorcore rap style born in the late 1980s .
gangsta rap's pioneers have met success in other forms of pop culture as well .

was inducted to the rock and roll hall of fame .
they were followed up by the late tupac shakur in *num* who was inducted as the first solo hip-hop act , under his first year of eligibility as a nominee .
other rock and roll hall of fame hip-hop acts include the *num* induction of grandmaster flash and the furious five , who are considered pioneers of expanding the sound of hip-hop from disco inspired partying , to street reality that inspired social change .
the *num* induction of run-d .
m .
c to the rock and roll hall of fame opened the door for more hip-hop inductions , as they were followed up by the *num* induction of the beastie boys , and the *num* induction of public enemy .
the explicit nature of gangsta rap's lyrics has made it heavily controversial .
there is also debate about the causation between gangsta rap and violent behavior .
a study by the prevention research center of the pacific institute for research and evaluation in berkeley , calif .
, finds young people who listen to rap and hip-hop are more likely to abuse alcohol and commit violent acts .
critics of gangsta rap hold that it glorifies and encourages criminal behavior , and may be at least partially to blame for the problem of street gangs .
although this view is often stereotyped as that of white conservatives , it has been shared by members of the black community , most notably bill cosby .
those who are supportive or at least less critical of gangsta rap hold that crime on the street level is for the most part a reaction to poverty and that gangsta rap reflects the reality of lower class life .
many believe that the blaming of crime on gangsta rap is a form of unwarranted moral panic ; the world development report *num* , for instance , confirmed that most street gang members maintain that poverty and unemployment is what drove them to crime ; none made reference to music .
ice cube famously satirized the blame placed on gangsta rap for social ills in his song " gangsta rap made me do it " .
moreover , english scholar ronald a .
t .
judy has argued that gangsta rap reflects the experience of blackness at the end of political economy , when capital is no longer wholly produced by human labor but in a globalized system of commodities .
in this economy , gangsta rap traffics blackness as a commodifiable affect of " being a nigga " .
in other words , gangsta rap defines the experience of blackness , in which he locates in gangsta rap's deployment of the word " nigga " , in this new global economic system as " adaptation to the force of commodification " .
for judy , " nigga " ( and gangsta rap ) becomes an epistemologically authentic category for describing the condition of being black in the modern " realm of things " .
despite this , many who hold that gangsta rap is not responsible for social ills are critical of the way many gangsta rappers intentionally exaggerate their criminal pasts for the sake of street credibility .
rick ross and slim jesus among others have been heavily criticized for this .

vice president dan quayle blasted the recording industry for producing rap music he believed led to violence .
quayle called on time warner inc .
subsidiary , interscope records , to withdraw tupac shakur's *num* debut album " 2pacalypse now " from stores .
quayle stated , " there is absolutely no reason for a record like this to be published—it has no place in our society .
" quayle's motivation came in light of the murder of a texas state trooper bill davidson , who had been shot by ronald ray howard after he had been pulled over .
howard was driving a stolen vehicle while songs from " 2pacalypse now " were playing on the tape deck when he was stopped by the officer .
the family of davidson filed a civil suit against shakur and interscope records , claiming the record's violent lyrics incite " imminent lawless action " .
district judge john d .
rainey held that shakur and the record companies did not have the duty to prevent distributing his music when they could not reasonably foresee violence arising from the distribution , nor was there any intent for the usage of the music as a " product for purposes of recovery under a products liability theory .
" judge rainey concluded the suit by ruling the davidsons ' argument that the music was unprotected speech under the first amendment was irrelevant .
politicians such as c .
delores tucker have cited concerns with sexually explicit and misogynistic lyrics featured in hip-hop tracks .
tucker claimed the explicit lyrics used in hip-hop songs were threatening to the african-american community .
tucker , who once was the highest-ranking african american woman in the pennsylvania state government , focused on rap music in *num* , labeling it as " pornographic filth " and claiming it was offensive and demeaning to black women .
tucker stated , " you can't listen to all that language and filth without it affecting you .
" tucker also handed out leaflets containing lyrics from rap music and urged people to read them aloud .
she picketed stores that sold the music and handed out petitions .
she then proceeded to buy stock in time warner , sony , and other companies for the sole purpose to protest rap music at shareholders meetings .
in *num* , tucker protested when the naacp nominated rapper tupac shakur for one of its image awards as outstanding actor in a motion picture from his role in " poetic justice " .
some rappers labeled her " narrow-minded " , and some ridiculed her in their lyrics , notably shakur , who mentions her multiple times in his diamond certified *num* album " all eyez on me " .
shakur mentions tucker in the tracks " wonda why they call u bitch " , and " how do u want it " , where shakur sings " delores tucker , you's a motherfucker / instead of trying to help a nigga you destroy a brother .
" tucker filed a $10 million lawsuit against shakur's estate for the comments made in both songs .
in her lawsuit , she claimed that the comments were slanderous , caused her emotional distress and invaded her personal privacy .
the case was eventually dismissed .
shakur wasn't the only rap artist to mention her in his songs , as jay-z , eminem , lil ' kim , the game and lil wayne have all previously criticized tucker for her opposition of the genre .
the gangster-rap movement in germany derived its roots from the ' 90s and since *num* / *num* has become a successful subgenre of german hip hop .
contextually and musically , it borrows its influences from the french and us-based gangsta rap and battle rap .
although there is a certain correlation between street-rap and gangster-rap , gangster-rap is not considered as a derivative genre since it is only partially related to street-rap and has contextually little to do with the other subgenre .
pioneers of the subgenre gangsta-rap , who have since the ' 90s still been active , are kool savas and azad .
within the genre , they implemented an incredibly explicit , broken and aggressive text , that originally still had a lot of influence from english text elements .
this style of rap , after the turn of the century , was implemented by the majority of gangsta-rappers in germany and is , therefore , a very well respected form on the approach of german gangsta-rap .
on the other hand , savas distanced himself from these vulgar and explicit texts .
one of the founding fathers of german gangsta-rap , charnell , the little-known rapper and martial-arts artist , thematized growing up in the midst of a social renaissance .
gangsta-rap in other countries , that resembled the music of the rödelheim hartreim projekt in germany , was commercially successful in the 2000s .
germany at the time , however , did not have a lot of rappers active in this subgenre ; allowing certain artists in the berlin underground-hip-hop scene an opportunity to establish themselves with their lyrics representing a certain hardship acquired through the criminal lifestyle which had previously been popularized .
recognizable names from the underground scene are bass sultan hengzt , fler , mc bogy or mok .
another notable rapper and pioneer of gangsta-rap in germany is azad .
although he came from the rural frankfurt am main , he was a big reason this subgenre became popular in germany .
in his lyrical text , he thematized the rigid and rough lifestyle of living in the northwest district of frankfurt .
at the beginning of the year *num* the process of commercialization of this subgenre began .
contrary to popular belief , a variable of the german gangsta-rap became popular before the actual subgenre itself did .
when sido , a notoriously known rapper from berlin , released his album " maske " which thematized gangs , drugs , and violence , this album became the first of its genre to sell *num* , *num* copies .
following that album sido released another two named " ich " and " ich und meine maske " which both had over *num* , *num* sold copies and emphasized the success of his first album .
following the success of sido and his albums , bushido became the next artist to emerge from the german gangsta-rap scene .
he established himself a career and became the most important representative of german gangsta-rap of his time .
aggro berlin , the label those two artists were both represented by , stated that this version of rap was the second , more aggressive evolution of german hip-hop .
bushido's albums " carlo , cokxxx , nutten " with fler and bushido's debut album " vom bordstein bis zur skyline " had relatively little success although the prominent topics on his album reflected directly with the themes that made sido popular .
following the continuous success of sido and bushido came a wave of rappers who were trying , with the help of major-labels , to establish themselves and be recognized by the populace .
eventually came massiv , who was signed with sony bmg , and was crowned by his label to be the german *num* cent .
this artist did not reach the success of *num* cent .
further artists such as baba saad or kollegah have since then established themselves as relatively successful in the german charts .
as of recently , names such as farid bang , nate57 , majoe & jasko and haftbefehl have appeared on the charts regularly .
gangsta-rap in germany originated from queensbridge-rap in the 1990s as well as french gansta-rap .
characteristically the necessary ambiance and melody for this type of hip-hop needs to be melancholic , dark , and often threatening .
often , the songs incorporate piano , choir , synthesizers , but also samples from classical and neo-classical arrangements .
all complexities such as minimalistic arrangements to vast orchestral symphonic arrangements are used and sampled in this subgenre .
commodore *num* the commodore *num* is commodore's high-end *num* " floppy disk drive .
with its double-sided drive mechanism , it has the ability to use double-sided , double-density ( ds / dd ) floppy disks natively .
this is in contrast to its predecessors , the *num* and *num* , which can fully read and write such disks only if the user manually flipped them over to access the second side .
because flipping the disk also reverses the direction of rotation , the two methods are not interchangeable ; disks which had their back side created in a *num* by flipping them over would have to be flipped in the *num* too , and the back side of disks written in a *num* using the native support for two-sided operation could not be read in a *num* .
the *num* was released to match the commodore *num* , both design-wise and feature-wise .
it was announced in the summer of *num* , at the same time as the c128 , and became available in quantity later that year .
the later c128"d " had a 1571-compatible drive integrated in the system unit .
a double-sided disk on the *num* would have a capacity of *num* kb ( *num* tracks , *num* , *num* disk blocks of *num* bytes each ) ; as *num* kb are reserved for system use ( directory and block availability information ) and , under of each block serve as pointers to the next logical block , = *num* , *num* b or about were available for user data .
( however , with a program organizing disk storage on its own , all space could be used , e .
g .
for data disks .
) the *num* was designed to accommodate the c128's " burst " mode for 2x faster disk access , however the drive cannot use it if connected to older commodore machines .
this mode replaced the slow bit-banging serial routines of the *num* with a true serial shift register implemented in hardware , thus dramatically increasing the drive speed .
although this originally had been planned when commodore first switched from the parallel ieee-488 interface to a custom serial interface ( cbm-488 ) , hardware bugs in the vic-20's *num* via shift register prevented it from working properly .
when connected to a c128 , the *num* would default to double-sided mode , which allowed the drive to read its own 340k disks as well as single-sided *num* kb *num* disks .
if the c128 was switched into c64 mode by typing go *num* from basic , the *num* will stay in double-sided mode .
if c64 mode was activated by holding down the c= key on power-up , the drive would automatically switch to single-sided mode , in which case it is unable to read *num* kb disks ( also the default if a *num* is used with a c64 , plus / *num* , vic-20 , or pet ) .
a manual command can also be issued from basic to switch the *num* between single and double sided mode .
there is also an undocumented command which allows the user to independently control either of the read / write heads of the *num* , making it possible to format both sides of a diskette separate from each other , however the resultant disk cannot be read in a *num* as it would be spinning in reverse direction when flipped upside down .
in the same vein , " flippy " disks created with a *num* cannot be read on a *num* with this feature ; they must be inserted upside down .
the *num* is not *num* % low-level compatible with the *num* , however this isn't a problem except in some software that uses advanced copy protections such as the rapidlok system found on microprose and accolade games .
the *num* was noticeably quieter than its predecessor and tended to run cooler as well , even though , like the *num* , it had an internal power supply ( later commodore drives , like the 1541-ii and the *num* " *num* , came with external power supplies ) .
the 1541-ii / *num* power supply makes mention of a 1571-ii , hinting that commodore may have intended to release a version of the *num* with an external power supply .
however , no 1571-iis are known to exist .
the embedded os in the *num* was an improvement over the early 1571s had a bug in the rom-based disk operating system that caused relative files to corrupt if they occupied both sides of the disk .
a version *num* rom was released , but though it cured the initial bug , it introduced some minor quirks of its own - particularly with the *num* emulation .
curiously , it was also identified as v3 .
*num* .
as with the *num* , commodore initially could not meet demand for the *num* , and that lack of availability and the drive's relatively high price ( about us$300 ) presented an opportunity for cloners .
two *num* clones appeared , one from oceanic and one from blue chip , but legal action from commodore quickly drove them from the market .
commodore announced at the *num* consumer electronics show a dual-drive version of the *num* , to be called the commodore *num* , but quickly canceled it , reportedly due to technical difficulties with the *num* dos .
it would have had four times as much ram as the *num* ( *num* kb ) , and twice as much rom ( *num* kb ) .
the *num* would have allowed for fast disk backups of non-copy-protected media , much like the old *num* , *num* , and *num* dual drives .
the *num* built into the european plastic-case c128 d computer is electronically identical to the stand-alone version , but *num* version integrated into the later metal-case c128 d ( often called c128 dcr , for d cost-reduced ) differs a lot from the stand-alone *num* .
it includes a newer dos , version *num* .
*num* , replaces the mos technology cia interface chip , of which only a few features were used by the *num* dos , with a very much simplified chip called *num* , and has some compatibility issues with the stand-alone drive .
because this internal *num* does not have an unused 8-bit input / output port on any chip , unlike most other commodore drives , it is not possible to install a parallel cable in this drive , such as that used by speeddos , dolphindos and some other fast third-party commodore dos replacements .
the drive detects the motor speed and generates an internal data sampling clock signal that matches with the motor speed .
the *num* uses a saddle canceler when reading the data stream .
a correction signal is generated when the raw data pattern on the disk consists of two consecutive zeros .
with the gcr recording format a problem occurs in the read signal waveform .
the worst case pattern *num* may cause a saddle condition where a false data bit may occur .
the original *num* drives uses a one-shot to correct the condition .
the *num* uses a gate array to corrected this digitally .
the drive uses the mos *num* cpu , wd1770 or wd1772 floppy controller , 2x mos technology *num* i / o controllers and 1x mos technology *num* .
unlike the *num* , which was limited to gcr formatting , the *num* could read both gcr and mfm disk formats .
the version of cp / m included with the c128 supported the following formats : if the cp / m bios is modified , it is possible to read any soft sector 40-track mfm format .
single density ( fm ) formats are not supported because the density selector pin on the mfm controller chip in the drive is disabled ( wired to ground ) .
a *num* cannot boot from mfm disks ; the user must boot cp / m from a gcr disk and then switch to mfm disks .
with additional software , it was possible to read and write to ms-dos-formatted floppies as well .
numerous commercial and public-domain programs for this purpose became available , the best-known being sogwap's " big blue reader " .
although the c128 could not run any dos-based software , this capability allowed data files to be exchanged with pc users .
reading or disks was possible as well with special software , but the standard format , which used fm rather than mfm encoding , could not be handled by the *num* hardware without modifying the drive circuitry as the control line that determines if fm or mfm encoding is used by the disc controller chip was permanently wired to ground ( mfm mode ) rather than being under software control .
in the *num* format , while *num* tracks are possible for a drive like the 154x / 157x , only are used .
commodore chose not to use the upper five tracks by default ( or at least to use more than *num* ) due to the bad quality of some of the drive mechanisms , which did not always work reliably on those tracks .
for compatibility and ease of implementation , the 1571's double-sided format of one logical disk side with was created by putting together the lower *num* physical tracks on each of the physical sides of the disk rather than using two times even though there were no more quality problems with the mechanisms of the *num* drives .
determinant in linear algebra , the determinant is a value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix and encodes certain properties of the linear transformation described by the matrix .
the determinant of a matrix is denoted , , or .
geometrically , it can be viewed as the volume scaling factor of the linear transformation described by the matrix .
this is also the signed volume of the " n"-dimensional parallelepiped spanned by the column or row vectors of the matrix .
the determinant is positive or negative according to whether the linear mapping preserves or reverses the orientation of " n"-space .
in the case of a matrix the determinant may be defined as : similarly , for a *num* × *num* matrix " a " , its determinant is : each determinant of a matrix in this equation is called a " minor " of the matrix .
this procedure can be extended to give a recursive definition for the determinant of an matrix , the " minor expansion formula " .
determinants occur throughout mathematics .
for example , a matrix is often used to represent the coefficients in a system of linear equations , and the determinant can be used to solve those equations , although other methods of solution are much more computationally efficient .
in linear algebra , a matrix ( with entries in a field ) is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero , and correspondingly the matrix is singular if and only if its determinant is zero .
this leads to the use of determinants in defining the characteristic polynomial of a matrix , whose roots are the eigenvalues .
in analytic geometry , determinants express the signed " n"-dimensional volumes of " n"-dimensional parallelepipeds .
this leads to the use of determinants in calculus , the jacobian determinant in the change of variables rule for integrals of functions of several variables .
determinants appear frequently in algebraic identities such as the vandermonde identity .
determinants possess many algebraic properties , including that the determinant of a product of matrices is equal to the product of determinants .
special types of matrices have special determinants ; for example , the determinant of an orthogonal matrix is always plus or minus one , and the determinant of a complex hermitian matrix is always real .
if an real matrix " a " is written in terms of its column vectors formula_3 then this means that formula_5 maps the unit n-cube to the " n"-dimensional parallelotope defined by the vectors formula_6 , the region formula_7 the determinant gives the signed n-dimensional volume of this parallelotope , formula_8 , and hence describes more generally the " n"-dimensional volume scaling factor of the linear transformation produced by " a " .
( the sign shows whether the transformation preserves or reverses orientation .
) in particular , if the determinant is zero , then this parallelotope has volume zero and is not fully " n"-dimensional , which indicates that the dimension of the image of " a " is less than " n " .
this means that " a " produces a linear transformation which is neither onto nor one-to-one , and so is not invertible .
there are various equivalent ways to define the determinant of a square matrix " a " , i .
e .
one with the same number of rows and columns .
perhaps the simplest way to express the determinant is by considering the elements in the top row and the respective minors ; starting at the left , multiply the element by the minor , then subtract the product of the next element and its minor , and alternate adding and subtracting such products until all elements in the top row have been exhausted .
for example , here is the result for a *num* × *num* matrix : another way to define the determinant is expressed in terms of the columns of the matrix .
if we write an matrix " a " in terms of its column vectors where the formula_11 are vectors of size " n " , then the determinant of " a " is defined so that where " b " and " c " are scalars , " v " is any vector of size " n " and " i " is the identity matrix of size " n " .
these equations say that the determinant is a linear function of each column , that interchanging adjacent columns reverses the sign of the determinant , and that the determinant of the identity matrix is *num* .
these properties mean that the determinant is an alternating multilinear function of the columns that maps the identity matrix to the underlying unit scalar .
these suffice to uniquely calculate the determinant of any square matrix .
provided the underlying scalars form a field ( more generally , a commutative ring with unity ) , the definition below shows that such a function exists , and it can be shown to be unique .
equivalently , the determinant can be expressed as a sum of products of entries of the matrix where each product has " n " terms and the coefficient of each product is −1 or *num* or *num* according to a given rule : it is a polynomial expression of the matrix entries .
this expression grows rapidly with the size of the matrix ( an matrix contributes " n " ! terms ) , so it will first be given explicitly for the case of matrices and matrices , followed by the rule for arbitrary size matrices , which subsumes these two cases .
assume " a " is a square matrix with " n " rows and " n " columns , so that it can be written as the entries can be numbers or expressions ( as happens when the determinant is used to define a characteristic polynomial ) ; the definition of the determinant depends only on the fact that they can be added and multiplied together in a commutative manner .
the determinant of " a " is denoted by det ( " a " ) , or it can be denoted directly in terms of the matrix entries by writing enclosing bars instead of brackets : the leibniz formula for the determinant of a matrix is if the matrix entries are real numbers , the matrix " a " can be used to represent two linear maps : one that maps the standard basis vectors to the rows of " a " , and one that maps them to the columns of " a " .
in either case , the images of the basis vectors form a parallelogram that represents the image of the unit square under the mapping .
the parallelogram defined by the rows of the above matrix is the one with vertices at , , , and , as shown in the accompanying diagram .
the absolute value of is the area of the parallelogram , and thus represents the scale factor by which areas are transformed by " a " .
( the parallelogram formed by the columns of " a " is in general a different parallelogram , but since the determinant is symmetric with respect to rows and columns , the area will be the same .
) the absolute value of the determinant together with the sign becomes the " oriented area " of the parallelogram .
the oriented area is the same as the usual area , except that it is negative when the angle from the first to the second vector defining the parallelogram turns in a clockwise direction ( which is opposite to the direction one would get for the identity matrix ) .
to show that is the signed area , one may consider a matrix containing two vectors and representing the parallelogram's sides .
the signed area can be expressed as for the angle " θ " between the vectors , which is simply base times height , the length of one vector times the perpendicular component of the other .
due to the sine this already is the signed area , yet it may be expressed more conveniently using the cosine of the complementary angle to a perpendicular vector , e .
g .
, such that , which can be determined by the pattern of the scalar product to be equal to : thus the determinant gives the scaling factor and the orientation induced by the mapping represented by " a " .
when the determinant is equal to one , the linear mapping defined by the matrix is equi-areal and orientation-preserving .
the object known as the " bivector " is related to these ideas .
in 2d , it can be interpreted as an " oriented plane segment " formed by imagining two vectors each with origin , and coordinates and .
the bivector magnitude ( denoted by ) is the " signed area " , which is also the determinant .
the laplace formula for the determinant of a matrix is this can be expanded out to give which is the leibniz formula for the determinant of a matrix .
the rule of sarrus is a mnemonic for the matrix determinant : the sum of the products of three diagonal north-west to south-east lines of matrix elements , minus the sum of the products of three diagonal south-west to north-east lines of elements , when the copies of the first two columns of the matrix are written beside it as in the illustration .
this scheme for calculating the determinant of a matrix does not carry over into higher dimensions .
the determinant of a matrix of arbitrary size can be defined by the leibniz formula or the laplace formula .
the leibniz formula for the determinant of an matrix " a " is here the sum is computed over all permutations σ of the set a permutation is a function that reorders this set of integers .
the value in the " i " position after the reordering σ is denoted by σ .
for example , for , the original sequence *num* , *num* , *num* might be reordered to , with , , and .
the set of all such permutations ( also known as the symmetric group on " n " elements ) is denoted by s .
for each permutation σ , sgn ( σ ) denotes the signature of σ , a value that is +1 whenever the reordering given by σ can be achieved by successively interchanging two entries an even number of times , and −1 whenever it can be achieved by an odd number of such interchanges .
in any of the formula_20 summands , the term is notation for the product of the entries at positions , where " i " ranges from *num* to " n " : for example , the determinant of a matrix " a " ( ) is it is sometimes useful to extend the leibniz formula to a summation in which not only permutations , but all sequences of " n " indices in the range occur , ensuring that the contribution of a sequence will be zero unless it denotes a permutation .
thus the totally antisymmetric levi-civita symbol formula_24 extends the signature of a permutation , by setting formula_25 for any permutation σ of " n " , and formula_26 when no permutation σ exists such that formula_27 for formula_28 ( or equivalently , whenever some pair of indices are equal ) .
the determinant for an matrix can then be expressed using an " n"-fold summation as or using two epsilon symbols as where now each " i " and each " j " should be summed over .
however , through the use of tensor notation and the supression of the summation symbol ( einstein's summation convention ) we can obtain a much more compact expression of the determinant of the second order system of formula_31 dimensions , formula_32 ; where formula_34 and formula_35 represent ' e-systems ' that take on the values *num* , +1 and -1 given the number of permutations of formula_36 and formula_37 .
more specifically , formula_35 is equal to *num* when there is a repeated index in formula_36 ; +1 when an even number of permutations of formula_36 is present ; -1 when an odd number of permutations of formula_36 is present .
note , that the number of indices present in the e-systems is equal to formula_42 and thus can be generalized in this manner .
the determinant has many properties .
some basic properties of determinants are property *num* says that the determinant on matrices is homogeneous of degree " n " .
these properties can be used to facilitate the computation of determinants by simplifying the matrix to the point where the determinant can be determined immediately .
specifically , for matrices with coefficients in a field , properties *num* and *num* can be used to transform any matrix into a triangular matrix , whose determinant is given by property *num* ; this is essentially the method of gaussian elimination .
for example , the determinant of can be computed using the following matrices : here , " b " is obtained from " a " by adding −1 / 2×the first row to the second , so that .
" c " is obtained from " b " by adding the first to the third row , so that .
finally , " d " is obtained from " c " by exchanging the second and third row , so that .
the determinant of the ( upper ) triangular matrix " d " is the product of its entries on the main diagonal : .
therefore , .
the following identity holds for a schur complement of a square matrix : the schur complement arises as the result of performing a block gaussian elimination by multiplying the matrix " m " from the right with a " block lower triangular " matrix here " i " denotes a " p"×"p " identity matrix .
after multiplication with the matrix " l " the schur complement appears in the upper " p"×"p " block .
the product matrix is that is , we have effected a gaussian decomposition the first and last matrices on the rhs have determinant unity , so we have this is schur's determinant identity .
the determinant of a matrix product of square matrices equals the product of their determinants : thus the determinant is a " multiplicative map " .
this property is a consequence of the characterization given above of the determinant as the unique " n"-linear alternating function of the columns with value *num* on the identity matrix , since the function that maps can easily be seen to be " n"-linear and alternating in the columns of " m " , and takes the value det ( " a " ) at the identity .
the formula can be generalized to ( square ) products of rectangular matrices , giving the cauchy–binet formula , which also provides an independent proof of the multiplicative property .
the determinant det ( " a " ) of a matrix " a " is non-zero if and only if " a " is invertible or , yet another equivalent statement , if its rank equals the size of the matrix .
if so , the determinant of the inverse matrix is given by in particular , products and inverses of matrices with determinant one still have this property .
thus , the set of such matrices ( of fixed size " n " ) form a group known as the special linear group .
more generally , the word " special " indicates the subgroup of another matrix group of matrices of determinant one .
examples include the special orthogonal group ( which if " n " is *num* or *num* consists of all rotation matrices ) , and the special unitary group .
laplace's formula expresses the determinant of a matrix in terms of its minors .
the minor " m " is defined to be the determinant of the -matrix that results from " a " by removing the " i"-th row and the " j"-th column .
the expression is known as a cofactor .
the determinant of " a " is given by calculating det ( " a " ) by means of this formula is referred to as expanding the determinant along a row , the " i"-th row using the first form with fixed " i " , or expanding along a column , using the second form with fixed " j " .
for example , the laplace expansion of the matrix along the second column ( and the sum runs over " i " ) is given by , however , laplace expansion is efficient for small matrices only .
the adjugate matrix adj ( " a " ) is the transpose of the matrix consisting of the cofactors , i .
e .
, in terms of the adjugate matrix , laplace's expansion can be written as sylvester's determinant theorem states that for " a " , an matrix , and " b " , an matrix ( so that " a " and " b " have dimensions allowing them to be multiplied in either order forming a square matrix ) : where " i " and " i " are the and identity matrices , respectively .
from this general result several consequences follow .
let be an arbitrary matrix of complex numbers with eigenvalues formula_65 , formula_66 , … , formula_67 .
( here it is understood that an eigenvalue with algebraic multiplicity occurs times in this list .
) then the determinant of is the product of all eigenvalues , the product of all non-zero eigenvalues is referred to as pseudo-determinant .
conversely , determinants can be used to find the eigenvalues of the matrix : they are the solutions of the characteristic equation where " i " is the identity matrix of the same dimension as and is a ( scalar ) number which solves the equation ( there are no more than solutions , where is the dimension of ) .
a hermitian matrix is positive definite if all its eigenvalues are positive .
sylvester's criterion asserts that this is equivalent to the determinants of the submatrices being positive , for all between *num* and .
the trace tr ( " a " ) is by definition the sum of the diagonal entries of and also equals the sum of the eigenvalues .
thus , for complex matrices , or , for real matrices , here exp ( ) denotes the matrix exponential of , because every eigenvalue of corresponds to the eigenvalue exp ( ) of exp ( ) .
in particular , given any logarithm of , that is , any matrix satisfying the determinant of is given by for example , for , , and , respectively , cf .
cayley-hamilton theorem .
such expressions are deducible from combinatorial arguments , newton's identities , or the faddeev–leverrier algorithm .
that is , for generic , the signed constant term of the characteristic polynomial , determined recursively from in the general case , this may also be obtained from where the sum is taken over the set of all integers " k " ≥ *num* satisfying the equation the formula can be expressed in terms of the complete exponential bell polynomial of " n " arguments " s " = − ( " l " – *num* ) ! tr ( " a " ) as this formula can also be used to find the determinant of a matrix with multidimensional indices and .
the product and trace of such matrices are defined in a natural way as an important arbitrary dimension identity can be obtained from the mercator series expansion of the logarithm when the expansion converges .
if every eigenvalue of " a " is less than *num* in absolute value , where is the identity matrix .
more generally , if is expanded as a formal power series in then all coefficients of for are zero and the remaining polynomial is .
for a positive definite matrix , the trace operator gives the following tight lower and upper bounds on the log determinant with equality if and only if .
this relationship can be derived via the formula for the kl-divergence between two multivariate normal distributions .
also , these inequalities can be proved by bringing the matrix " a " to the diagonal form .
as such , they represent the well-known fact that the harmonic mean is less than the geometric mean , which is less than the arithmetic mean , which is , in turn , less than the root mean square .
for a matrix equation the solution is given by cramer's rule : where " a " is the matrix formed by replacing the " i"th column of " a " by the column vector " b " .
this follows immediately by column expansion of the determinant , i .
e .
where the vectors formula_11 are the columns of " a " .
the rule is also implied by the identity it has recently been shown that cramer's rule can be implemented in o ( " n " ) time , which is comparable to more common methods of solving systems of linear equations , such as lu , qr , or singular value decomposition .
suppose " a " , " b " , " c " , and " d " are matrices of dimension , , , and , respectively .
then this can be seen from the leibniz formula , or from a decomposition like ( for the former case ) when " a " is invertible , one has as can be seen by employing the decomposition when " d " is invertible , a similar identity with formula_94 factored out can be derived analogously , that is , when the blocks are square matrices of the same order further formulas hold .
for example , if " c " and " d " commute ( i .
e .
, ) , then the following formula comparable to the determinant of a matrix holds : generally , if all pairs of matrices of the block matrix commute , then the determinant of the block matrix is equal to the determinant of the matrix obtained by computing the determinant of the block matrix considering its entries as the entries of a matrix .
as the previous formula shows , for " p " = *num* , this criterion is sufficient , but not necessary .
when " a " = " d " and " b " = " c " , the blocks are square matrices of the same order and the following formula holds ( even if " a " and " b " do not commute ) when " d " is a 1×1 matrix , " b " is a column vector , and " c " is a row vector then let formula_99 be a scalar complex number .
if a block matrix is square , its characteristic polynomial can be factored with it can be seen , e .
g .
using the leibniz formula , that the determinant of real ( or analogously for complex ) square matrices is a polynomial function from to r , and so it is everywhere differentiable .
its derivative can be expressed using jacobi's formula : where adj ( " a " ) denotes the adjugate of " a " .
in particular , if " a " is invertible , we have expressed in terms of the entries of " a " , these are yet another equivalent formulation is using big o notation .
the special case where formula_105 , the identity matrix , yields this identity is used in describing the tangent space of certain matrix lie groups .
if the matrix a is written as formula_107 where a , b , c are column vectors of length *num* , then the gradient over one of the three vectors may be written as the cross product of the other two : the above identities concerning the determinant of products and inverses of matrices imply that similar matrices have the same determinant : two matrices " a " and " b " are similar , if there exists an invertible matrix " x " such that .
indeed , repeatedly applying the above identities yields the determinant is therefore also called a similarity invariant .
the determinant of a linear transformation for some finite-dimensional vector space " v " is defined to be the determinant of the matrix describing it , with respect to an arbitrary choice of basis in " v " .
by the similarity invariance , this determinant is independent of the choice of the basis for " v " and therefore only depends on the endomorphism " t " .
the determinant of a linear transformation of an " n"-dimensional vector space " v " can be formulated in a coordinate-free manner by considering the " n"th exterior power λ"v " of " v " .
" a " induces a linear map as λ"v " is one-dimensional , the map λa is given by multiplying with some scalar .
this scalar coincides with the determinant of " a " , that is to say this definition agrees with the more concrete coordinate-dependent definition .
this follows from the characterization of the determinant given above .
for example , switching two columns changes the sign of the determinant ; likewise , permuting the vectors in the exterior product to , say , also changes its sign .
for this reason , the highest non-zero exterior power λ ( " v " ) is sometimes also called the determinant of " v " and similarly for more involved objects such as vector bundles or chain complexes of vector spaces .
minors of a matrix can also be cast in this setting , by considering lower alternating forms λ"v " with .
the vector space " w " of all alternating multilinear " n"-forms on an " n"-dimensional vector space " v " has dimension one .
to each linear transformation " t " on " v " we associate a linear transformation " t"′ on " w " , where for each " w " in " w " we define .
as a linear transformation on a one-dimensional space , " t"′ is equivalent to a scalar multiple .
we call this scalar the determinant of " t " .
the determinant can also be characterized as the unique function from the set of all matrices with entries in a field " k " to this field satisfying the following three properties : first , " d " is an " n"-linear function : considering all but one column of " a " fixed , the determinant is linear in the remaining column , that is for any column vectors " v " , .
.
.
, " v " , and " w " and any scalars ( elements of " k " ) " a " and " b " .
second , " d " is an alternating function : for any matrix " a " with two identical columns , .
finally , , where " i " is the identity matrix .
this fact also implies that every other " n"-linear alternating function satisfies this definition can also be extended where " k " is a commutative ring " r " , in which case a matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is an invertible element in " r " .
for example , a matrix " a " with entries in z , the integers , is invertible ( in the sense that there exists an inverse matrix with integer entries ) if the determinant is +1 or −1 .
such a matrix is called unimodular .
the determinant defines a mapping between the group of invertible matrices with entries in " r " and the multiplicative group of units in " r " .
since it respects the multiplication in both groups , this map is a group homomorphism .
secondly , given a ring homomorphism , there is a map given by replacing all entries in " r " by their images under " f " .
the determinant respects these maps , i .
e .
, given a matrix with entries in " r " , the identity holds .
in other words , the following diagram commutes : for example , the determinant of the complex conjugate of a complex matrix ( which is also the determinant of its conjugate transpose ) is the complex conjugate of its determinant , and for integer matrices : the reduction modulo "m " of the determinant of such a matrix is equal to the determinant of the matrix reduced modulo "m " ( the latter determinant being computed using modular arithmetic ) .
in the language of category theory , the determinant is a natural transformation between the two functors gl and ( ⋅ ) ( see also natural transformation#determinant ) .
adding yet another layer of abstraction , this is captured by saying that the determinant is a morphism of algebraic groups , from the general linear group to the multiplicative group , for matrices with an infinite number of rows and columns , the above definitions of the determinant do not carry over directly .
for example , in the leibniz formula , an infinite sum ( all of whose terms are infinite products ) would have to be calculated .
functional analysis provides different extensions of the determinant for such infinite-dimensional situations , which however only work for particular kinds of operators .
the fredholm determinant defines the determinant for operators known as trace class operators by an appropriate generalization of the formula another infinite-dimensional notion of determinant is the functional determinant .
for operators in a finite factor , one may define a positive real-valued determinant called the fuglede−kadison determinant using the canonical trace .
in fact , corresponding to every tracial state on a von neumann algebra there is a notion of fuglede−kadison determinant .
for square matrices with entries in a non-commutative ring , there are various difficulties in defining determinants analogously to that for commutative rings .
a meaning can be given to the leibniz formula provided that the order for the product is specified , and similarly for other ways to define the determinant , but non-commutativity then leads to the loss of many fundamental properties of the determinant , for instance the multiplicative property or the fact that the determinant is unchanged under transposition of the matrix .
over non-commutative rings , there is no reasonable notion of a multilinear form ( existence of a nonzero with a regular element of " r " as value on some pair of arguments implies that " r " is commutative ) .
nevertheless , various notions of non-commutative determinant have been formulated , which preserve some of the properties of determinants , notably quasideterminants and the dieudonné determinant .
it may be noted that if one considers certain specific classes of matrices with non-commutative elements , then there are examples where one can define the determinant and prove linear algebra theorems that are very similar to their commutative analogs .
examples include quantum groups and " q"-determinant , capelli matrix and capelli determinant , super-matrices and berezinian ; manin matrices is the class of matrices which is most close to matrices with commutative elements .
determinants of matrices in superrings ( that is , z-graded rings ) are known as berezinians or superdeterminants .
the permanent of a matrix is defined as the determinant , except that the factors sgn ( " σ " ) occurring in leibniz's rule are omitted .
the immanant generalizes both by introducing a character of the symmetric group s in leibniz's rule .
determinants are mainly used as a theoretical tool .
they are rarely calculated explicitly in numerical linear algebra , where for applications like checking invertibility and finding eigenvalues the determinant has largely been supplanted by other techniques .
computational geometry , however , does frequently use calculations related to determinants .
naive methods of implementing an algorithm to compute the determinant include using the leibniz formula or laplace's formula .
both these approaches are extremely inefficient for large matrices , though , since the number of required operations grows very quickly : it is of order " n " ! ( " n " factorial ) for an matrix " m " .
for example , leibniz's formula requires calculating " n " ! products .
therefore , more involved techniques have been developed for calculating determinants .
given a matrix " a " , some methods compute its determinant by writing " a " as a product of matrices whose determinants can be more easily computed .
such techniques are referred to as decomposition methods .
examples include the lu decomposition , the qr decomposition or the cholesky decomposition ( for positive definite matrices ) .
these methods are of order o ( " n " ) , which is a significant improvement over o ( " n " ! ) the lu decomposition expresses " a " in terms of a lower triangular matrix " l " , an upper triangular matrix " u " and a permutation matrix " p " : the determinants of " l " and " u " can be quickly calculated , since they are the products of the respective diagonal entries .
the determinant of " p " is just the sign formula_121 of the corresponding permutation ( which is +1 for an even number of permutations and is −1 for an uneven number of permutations ) .
the determinant of " a " is then ( see determinant identities .
) moreover , the decomposition can be chosen such that " l " is a unitriangular matrix and therefore has determinant *num* , in which case the formula further simplifies to if the determinant of " a " and the inverse of " a " have already been computed , the matrix determinant lemma allows rapid calculation of the determinant of , where " u " and " v " are column vectors .
since the definition of the determinant does not need divisions , a question arises : do fast algorithms exist that do not need divisions ? this is especially interesting for matrices over rings .
indeed , algorithms with run-time proportional to " n " exist .
an algorithm of mahajan and vinay , and berkowitz is based on closed ordered walks ( short " clow " ) .
it computes more products than the determinant definition requires , but some of these products cancel and the sum of these products can be computed more efficiently .
the final algorithm looks very much like an iterated product of triangular matrices .
if two matrices of order " n " can be multiplied in time " m " ( " n " ) , where for some , then the determinant can be computed in time o ( " m " ( " n " ) ) .
this means , for example , that an o ( " n " ) algorithm exists based on the coppersmith–winograd algorithm .
charles dodgson ( i .
e .
lewis carroll of alice's adventures in wonderland fame ) invented a method for computing determinants called dodgson condensation .
unfortunately this interesting method does not always work in its original form .
algorithms can also be assessed according to their bit complexity , i .
e .
, how many bits of accuracy are needed to store intermediate values occurring in the computation .
for example , the gaussian elimination ( or lu decomposition ) method is of order o ( " n " ) , but the bit length of intermediate values can become exponentially long .
the bareiss algorithm , on the other hand , is an exact-division method based on sylvester's identity is also of order " n " , but the bit complexity is roughly the bit size of the original entries in the matrix times " n " .
historically , determinants were used long before matrices : originally , a determinant was defined as a property of a system of linear equations .
the determinant " determines " whether the system has a unique solution ( which occurs precisely if the determinant is non-zero ) .
in this sense , determinants were first used in the chinese mathematics textbook " the nine chapters on the mathematical art " ( 九章算術 , chinese scholars , around the *ord* century bce ) .
in europe , determinants were considered by cardano at the end of the *ord* century and larger ones by leibniz .
in japan , seki takakazu ( 関 孝和 ) is credited with the discovery of the resultant and the determinant ( at first in *num* , the complete version no later than *num* ) .
in europe , cramer ( *num* ) added to the theory , treating the subject in relation to sets of equations .
the recurrence law was first announced by bézout ( *num* ) .
it was vandermonde ( *num* ) who first recognized determinants as independent functions .
laplace ( *num* ) gave the general method of expanding a determinant in terms of its complementary minors : vandermonde had already given a special case .
immediately following , lagrange ( *num* ) treated determinants of the second and third order and applied it to questions of elimination theory ; he proved many special cases of general identities .
gauss ( *num* ) made the next advance .
like lagrange , he made much use of determinants in the theory of numbers .
he introduced the word determinant ( laplace had used " resultant " ) , though not in the present signification , but rather as applied to the discriminant of a quantic .
gauss also arrived at the notion of reciprocal ( inverse ) determinants , and came very near the multiplication theorem .
the next contributor of importance is binet ( *num* , *num* ) , who formally stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of " m " columns and " n " rows , which for the special case of reduces to the multiplication theorem .
on the same day ( november *num* , *num* ) that binet presented his paper to the academy , cauchy also presented one on the subject .
( see cauchy–binet formula .
) in this he used the word determinant in its present sense , summarized and simplified what was then known on the subject , improved the notation , and gave the multiplication theorem with a proof more satisfactory than binet's .
with him begins the theory in its generality .
the next important figure was jacobi ( from *num* ) .
he early used the functional determinant which sylvester later called the jacobian , and in his memoirs in " crelle's journal " for *num* he specially treats this subject , as well as the class of alternating functions which sylvester has called " alternants " .
about the time of jacobi's last memoirs , sylvester ( *num* ) and cayley began their work .
the study of special forms of determinants has been the natural result of the completion of the general theory .
axisymmetric determinants have been studied by lebesgue , hesse , and sylvester ; persymmetric determinants by sylvester and hankel ; circulants by catalan , spottiswoode , glaisher , and scott ; skew determinants and pfaffians , in connection with the theory of orthogonal transformation , by cayley ; continuants by sylvester ; wronskians ( so called by muir ) by christoffel and frobenius ; compound determinants by sylvester , reiss , and picquet ; jacobians and hessians by sylvester ; and symmetric gauche determinants by trudi .
of the textbooks on the subject spottiswoode's was the first .
in america , hanus ( *num* ) , weld ( *num* ) , and muir / metzler ( *num* ) published treatises .
as mentioned above , the determinant of a matrix ( with real or complex entries , say ) is zero if and only if the column vectors ( or the row vectors ) of the matrix are linearly dependent .
thus , determinants can be used to characterize linearly dependent vectors .
for example , given two linearly independent vectors " v " , " v " in r , a third vector " v " lies in the plane spanned by the former two vectors exactly if the determinant of the matrix consisting of the three vectors is zero .
the same idea is also used in the theory of differential equations : given " n " functions " f " ( " x " ) , … , " f " ( " x " ) ( supposed to be times differentiable ) , the wronskian is defined to be it is non-zero ( for some " x " ) in a specified interval if and only if the given functions and all their derivatives up to order " n"−1 are linearly independent .
if it can be shown that the wronskian is zero everywhere on an interval then , in the case of analytic functions , this implies the given functions are linearly dependent .
see the wronskian and linear independence .
the determinant can be thought of as assigning a number to every sequence of " n " vectors in r , by using the square matrix whose columns are the given vectors .
for instance , an orthogonal matrix with entries in r represents an orthonormal basis in euclidean space .
the determinant of such a matrix determines whether the orientation of the basis is consistent with or opposite to the orientation of the standard basis .
if the determinant is +1 , the basis has the same orientation .
if it is −1 , the basis has the opposite orientation .
more generally , if the determinant of " a " is positive , " a " represents an orientation-preserving linear transformation ( if " a " is an orthogonal or matrix , this is a rotation ) , while if it is negative , " a " switches the orientation of the basis .
as pointed out above , the absolute value of the determinant of real vectors is equal to the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by those vectors .
as a consequence , if is the linear map represented by the matrix " a " , and " s " is any measurable subset of r , then the volume of " f " ( " s " ) is given by times the volume of " s " .
more generally , if the linear map is represented by the matrix " a " , then the " n"-dimensional volume of " f " ( " s " ) is given by : by calculating the volume of the tetrahedron bounded by four points , they can be used to identify skew lines .
the volume of any tetrahedron , given its vertices a , b , c , and d , is , or any other combination of pairs of vertices that would form a spanning tree over the vertices .
for a general differentiable function , much of the above carries over by considering the jacobian matrix of " f " .
for the jacobian matrix is the matrix whose entries are given by its determinant , the jacobian determinant , appears in the higher-dimensional version of integration by substitution : for suitable functions " f " and an open subset " u " of r ( the domain of " f " ) , the integral over " f " ( " u " ) of some other function is given by the jacobian also occurs in the inverse function theorem .
the third order vandermonde determinant is in general , the " n"th-order vandermonde determinant is where the right-hand side is the continued product of all the differences that can be formed from the " n " ( " n"−1 ) / *num* pairs of numbers taken from " x " , " x " , … , " x " , with the order of the differences taken in the reversed order of the suffixes that are involved .
second order third order where " ω " and " ω " are the complex cube roots of *num* .
in general , the " n"th-order circulant determinant is where " ω " is an " n"th root of *num* .
hermann kolbe adolph wilhelm hermann kolbe ( *num* september *num* – *num* november *num* ) was a seminal contributor in the birth of modern organic chemistry .
he was a professor at marburg and leipzig .
kolbe coined the term synthesis and contributed to the philosophical demise of vitalism through synthesis of the organic substance acetic acid from carbon disulfide , and also contributed to the development of structural theory .
this was done via modifications to the idea of " radicals " and accurate prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols , and to the emerging array of organic reactions through his kolbe electrolysis of carboxylate salts , the kolbe-schmitt reaction in the preparation of aspirin and the kolbe nitrile synthesis .
after studies with wöhler and bunsen , kolbe was involved with the early internationalization of chemistry through overseas work in london ( with frankland ) , and rose through the ranks of his field to edit the .
as such , he was elected to the royal swedish academy of sciences won the royal society of london's davy medal in the year of his death .
despite these accomplishments and his training a storied next generation of chemists ( including zaitsev , curtius , beckmann , graebe , markovnikov , etc .
) , kolbe is remembered for editing the " journal " for more than a decade , where his rejection of kekulé's structure of benzene , van't hoff's theory on the origin of chirality and von baeyer's reforms of nomenclature were personally critical and linguistically violent .
kolbe died of a heart attack in leipzig at age *num* , six years after the death of his wife , charlotte .
he was survived by four children .
kolbe was born in elliehausen , near göttingen , kingdom of hanover ( germany ) as the eldest son of a protestant pastor .
at the age of *num* , he entered the göttingen gymnasium , residing at the home of one of the professors .
he obtained the leaving certificate ( the abitur ) six years later .
he had become passionate about the study of chemistry , matriculating at the university of göttingen in the spring of *num* in order to study with the famous chemist friedrich wöhler .
in *num* , he became an assistant to robert bunsen at the philipps-universität marburg .
he took his doctoral degree in *num* at the same university .
a new opportunity arose in *num* , when he became assistant to lyon playfair at the new " museum of economic geology " in london and a close friend of edward frankland .
from *num* , he was engaged in editing the " handwörterbuch der reinen und angewandten chemie " ( " dictionary of pure and applied chemistry " ) edited by justus von liebig , wöhler , and johann christian poggendorff , and he also wrote an important textbook .
in *num* , kolbe succeeded bunsen as professor of chemistry at marburg and , in *num* , he was called to the universität leipzig .
in *num* , he was elected a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences .
in *num* , he married charlotte , the daughter of general-major wilhelm von bardeleben .
his wife died in *num* after *num* years of happy marriage .
they had four children .
as late as the 1840s , and despite friedrich wöhler's synthesis of urea in *num* , some chemists still believed in the doctrine of vitalism , according to which a special life-force was necessary to create " organic " ( i .
e .
, in its original meaning , biologically derived ) compounds .
kolbe promoted the idea that organic compounds could be derived from substances clearly sourced from outside this " organic " context , directly or indirectly , by substitution processes .
( hence , while by modern definitions , he was converting one organic molecule to another , by the parlance of his era , he was converting " inorganic"—"anorganisch"—substances into " organic " ones only thought accessible through vital processes .
) he validated his theory by converting carbon disulfide to acetic acid in several steps ( 1843–45 ) .
kolbe also introduced a modified idea of structural radicals , so contributing to the development of structural theory .
a dramatic success came when his theoretical prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols was confirmed by the synthesis of the first of these classes of organic molecules .
kolbe was the first person to use the word synthesis in its present-day meaning , and contributed a number of new chemical reactions .
in particular , kolbe developed procedures for the electrolysis of the salts of fatty and other carboxylic acids ( kolbe electrolysis ) and prepared salicylic acid , a building block of aspirin in a process called kolbe synthesis or kolbe-schmitt reaction .
his method for the synthesis of nitriles is called the kolbe nitrile synthesis , and with edward frankland he found that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding acids .
in addition to his own bench research and scholarly and editorial work , kolbe oversaw student research at leipzig and especially at marburg ; students spending time under his tutelage included peter griess , aleksandr mikhailovich zaitsev ( known for zaitsev's rule predicting the product composition of elimination reactions ) , theodor curtius ( discoverer of diazo compounds , hydrazines , and the curtius rearrangement ) , ernst otto beckmann ( discoverer of the beckmann rearrangement ) , carl graebe ( discoverer of alizarin ) , oscar loew , constantin fahlberg , nikolai menshutkin , vladimir markovnikov ( first to describe carbocycles smaller and larger than cyclohexane , and known for markovnikov's rule describing addition reactions to alkenes ) , jacob volhard , ludwig mond , alexander crum brown ( first to describe the double bond of ethylene ) , maxwell simpson , and frederick guthrie .
besides his work for periodicals he wrote numerous books kolbe served for more than a decade as what , in modern terms , would be understood the senior editor of the ( " journal of practical chemistry " , from *num* to *num* ) , kolbe was sometimes so severely critical of the work of others , especially after about *num* , that some wondered whether he might have been suffering a mental illness .
he was intolerant of what he regarded as loose speculation parading as theory , and sought through his writings to save his beloved science of chemistry from what he regarded as the scourge of modern structural theory .
his rejection of structural chemistry , especially the theories of the structure of benzene by august kekulé , the theory of the asymmetric carbon atom by j .
h .
van't hoff , and the reform of chemical nomenclature by adolf von baeyer , was expressed in his vituperative articles in the " journal für praktische chemie " .
some translated quotes illustrate his manner of articulating the deep conflict between his interpretation of chemistry and that of the structural chemists : " .
.
.
baeyer is an excellent experimentor , but he is only an empiricist , lacking sense and capability , and his interpretations of his experiments show particular deficiency in his familiarity with the principles of true science .
.

" the violence of his language worked unfairly to limit his posthumous reputation .
cathode a cathode is the electrode from which a conventional current leaves a polarized electrical device .
this definition can be recalled by using the mnemonic " ccd " for " cathode current departs " .
a conventional current describes the direction in which positive charges move .
electrons have a negative electrical charge , so the movement of electrons is opposite to that of the conventional current flow .
consequently , the mnemonic " cathode current departs " also means that electrons flow " into " the device's cathode from the external circuit .
the electrode through which conventional current flows the other way , into the device , is termed an anode .
conventional current flow is from cathode to anode outside of the cell or device ( with electrons moving in the opposite direction ) , regardless of the cell or device type and operating mode .
cathode polarity with respect to the anode can be positive or negative depending on how the device is being operated .
although positively charged cations always move towards the cathode ( hence their name ) and negatively charged anions move away from it , cathode polarity depends on the device type , and can even vary according to the operating mode .
in a device which absorbs energy of charge ( such as recharging a battery ) , the cathode is negative ( electrons flow out of the cathode , and charge flows into it ) , and in a device which provides energy ( such as battery in use ) , the cathode is positive ( electrons flow into it and charge flows out ) : a battery or galvanic cell in use has a cathode that is the positive terminal since that is where the current flows out of the device .
this outward current is carried internally by positive ions moving from the electrolyte to the positive cathode ( chemical energy is responsible for this " uphill " motion ) .
it is continued externally by electrons moving into the battery which constitutes positive current flowing outwards .
for example , the daniell galvanic cell's copper electrode is the positive terminal and the cathode .
a battery that is recharging or an electrolytic cell performing electrolysis has its cathode as the negative terminal , from which current exits the device and returns to the external generator as charge enters the battery / cell .
for example , reversing the current direction in a daniell galvanic cell converts it into an electrolytic cell where the copper electrode is the positive terminal and also the anode .
in a diode , the cathode is the negative terminal at the pointed end of the arrow symbol , where current flows out of the device .
note : electrode naming for diodes is always based on the direction of the forward current ( that of the arrow , in which the current flows " most easily " ) , even for types such as zener diodes or solar cells where the current of interest is the reverse current .
in vacuum tubes ( including cathode ray tubes ) it is the negative terminal where electrons enter the device from the external circuit and proceed into the tube's near-vacuum , constituting a positive current flowing out of the device .
the word was coined in *num* from the greek κάθοδος ( " kathodos " ) , ' descent ' or ' way down ' , by william whewell , who had been consulted by michael faraday over some new names needed to complete a paper on the recently discovered process of electrolysis .
in that paper faraday explained that when an electrolytic cell is oriented so that electric current traverses the " decomposing body " ( electrolyte ) in a direction " from east to west , or , which will strengthen this help to the memory , that in which the sun appears to move " , the cathode is where the current leaves the electrolyte , on the west side : " "kata " downwards , " `odos " a way ; the way which the sun sets " .
the use of ' west ' to mean the ' out ' direction ( actually ' out ' → ' west ' → ' sunset ' → ' down ' , i .
e .
' out of view ' ) may appear unnecessarily contrived .
previously , as related in the first reference cited above , faraday had used the more straightforward term " exode " ( the doorway where the current exits ) .
his motivation for changing it to something meaning ' the west electrode ' ( other candidates had been " westode " , " occiode " and " dysiode " ) was to make it immune to a possible later change in the direction convention for current , whose exact nature was not known at the time .
the reference he used to this effect was the earth's magnetic field direction , which at that time was believed to be invariant .
he fundamentally defined his arbitrary orientation for the cell as being that in which the internal current would run parallel to and in the same direction as a hypothetical magnetizing current loop around the local line of latitude which would induce a magnetic dipole field oriented like the earth's .
this made the internal current east to west as previously mentioned , but in the event of a later convention change it would have become west to east , so that the west electrode would not have been the ' way out ' any more .
therefore , " exode " would have become inappropriate , whereas " cathode " meaning ' west electrode ' would have remained correct with respect to the unchanged direction of the actual phenomenon underlying the current , then unknown but , he thought , unambiguously defined by the magnetic reference .
in retrospect the name change was unfortunate , not only because the greek roots alone do not reveal the cathode's function any more , but more importantly because , as we now know , the earth's magnetic field direction on which the " cathode " term is based is subject to reversals whereas the current direction convention on which the " exode " term was based has no reason to change in the future .
since the later discovery of the electron , an easier to remember , and more durably technically correct ( although historically false ) , etymology has been suggested : cathode , from the greek " kathodos " , ' way down ' , ' the way ( down ) into the cell ( or other device ) for electrons ' .
in chemistry , a cathode is the electrode of an electrochemical cell at which reduction occurs ; a useful mnemonic to remember this is anox redcat ( oxidation at the anode = reduction at the cathode ) .
another mnemonic is to note the cathode has a ' c ' , as does ' reduction ' .
hence , reduction at the cathode .
perhaps most useful would be to remember cathode corresponds to cation ( acceptor ) and anode corresponds to anion ( donor ) .
the cathode can be negative like when the cell is electrolytic ( where electrical energy provided to the cell is being used for decomposing chemical compounds ) ; or positive as when the cell is galvanic ( where chemical reactions are used for generating electrical energy ) .
the cathode supplies electrons to the positively charged cations which flow to it from the electrolyte ( even if the cell is galvanic , i .
e .
, when the cathode is positive and therefore would be expected to repel the positively charged cations ; this is due to electrode potential relative to the electrolyte solution being different for the anode and cathode metal / electrolyte systems in a galvanic cell ) .
the cathodic current , in electrochemistry , is the flow of electrons from the cathode interface to a species in solution .
the anodic current is the flow of electrons into the anode from a species in solution .
in an electrolytic cell , the cathode is where the negative polarity is applied to drive the cell .
common results of reduction at the cathode are hydrogen gas or pure metal from metal ions .
when discussing the relative reducing power of two redox agents , the couple for generating the more reducing species is said to be more " cathodic " with respect to the more easily reduced reagent .
in a galvanic cell , the cathode is where the positive pole is connected to allow the circuit to be completed : as the anode of the galvanic cell gives off electrons , they return from the circuit into the cell through the cathode .
when metal ions are reduced from ionic solution , they form a pure metal surface on the cathode .
items to be plated with pure metal are attached to and become part of the cathode in the electrolytic solution .
in a vacuum tube or electronic vacuum system , the cathode is a metal surface which emits free electrons into the evacuated space .
since the electrons are attracted to the positive nuclei of the metal atoms , they normally stay inside the metal and require energy to leave it ; this is called the " work function " of the metal .
cathodes are induced to emit electrons by several mechanisms : cathodes can be divided into two types : a hot cathode is a cathode that is heated by a filament to produce electrons by thermionic emission .
the filament is a thin wire of a refractory metal like tungsten heated red-hot by an electric current passing through it .
before the advent of transistors in the 1960s , virtually all electronic equipment used hot-cathode vacuum tubes .
today hot cathodes are used in vacuum tubes in radio transmitters and microwave ovens , to produce the electron beams in older cathode ray tube ( crt ) type televisions and computer monitors , in x-ray generators , electron microscopes , and fluorescent tubes .
there are two types of hot cathodes : in order to improve electron emission , cathodes are treated with chemicals , usually compounds of metals with a low work function .
treated cathodes require less surface area , lower temperatures and less power to supply the same cathode current .
the untreated tungsten filaments used in early tubes ( called " bright emitters " ) had to be heated to *num* °c ( ~2500 °f ) , white-hot , to produce sufficient thermionic emission for use , while modern coated cathodes produce far more electrons at a given temperature so they only have to be heated to 425–600 °c ( ~800–1100 °f ) ( ) there are two main types of treated cathodes : this is a cathode that is not heated by a filament .
they may emit electrons by field electron emission , and in gas-filled tubes by secondary emission .
some examples are electrodes in neon lights , cold-cathode fluorescent lamps ( ccfls ) used as backlights in laptops , thyratron tubes , and crookes tubes .
they do not necessarily operate at room temperature ; in some devices the cathode is heated by the electron current flowing through it to a temperature at which thermionic emission occurs .
for example , in some fluorescent tubes a momentary high voltage is applied to the electrodes to start the current through the tube ; after starting the electrodes are heated enough by the current to keep emitting electrons to sustain the discharge .
cold cathodes may also emit electrons by photoelectric emission .
these are often called " photocathodes " and are used in phototubes used in scientific instruments and image intensifier tubes used in night vision goggles .
in a semiconductor diode , the cathode is the n–doped layer of the pn junction with a high density of free electrons due to doping , and an equal density of fixed positive charges , which are the dopants that have been thermally ionized .
in the anode , the converse applies : it features a high density of free " holes " and consequently fixed negative dopants which have captured an electron ( hence the origin of the holes ) .
when p and n-doped layers are created adjacent to each other , diffusion ensures that electrons flow from high to low density areas : that is , from the n to the p side .
they leave behind the fixed positively charged dopants near the junction .
similarly , holes diffuse from p to n leaving behind fixed negative ionised dopants near the junction .
these layers of fixed positive and negative charges are collectively known as the depletion layer because they are depleted of free electrons and holes .
the depletion layer at the junction is at the origin of the diode's rectifying properties .
this is due to the resulting internal field and corresponding potential barrier which inhibit current flow in reverse applied bias which increases the internal depletion layer field .
conversely , they allow it in forwards applied bias where the applied bias reduces the built in potential barrier .
electrons which diffuse from the cathode into the p-doped layer , or anode , become what are termed " minority carriers " and tend to recombine there with the majority carriers , which are holes , on a timescale characteristic of the material which is the p-type minority carrier lifetime .
similarly , holes diffusing into the n-doped layer become minority carriers and tend to recombine with electrons .
in equilibrium , with no applied bias , thermally assisted diffusion of electrons and holes in opposite directions across the depletion layer ensure a zero net current with electrons flowing from cathode to anode and recombining , and holes flowing from anode to cathode across the junction or depletion layer and recombining .
like a typical diode , there is a fixed anode and cathode in a zener diode , but it will conduct current in the reverse direction ( electrons flow from anode to cathode ) if its breakdown voltage or " zener voltage " is exceeded .
demand-pull inflation demand-pull inflation is asserted to arise when aggregate demand in an economy outpaces aggregate supply .
it involves inflation rising as real gross domestic product rises and unemployment falls , as the economy moves along the phillips curve .
this is commonly described as " "too much money chasing too few goods .
" " more accurately , it should be described as involving " "too much money spent chasing too few goods , " " since only money that is spent on goods and services can cause inflation .
this would not be expected to happen , unless the economy is already at a full employment level .
it is the opposite of cost-push inflation .
in keynesian theory , increased employment results in increased aggregate demand ( ad ) , which leads to further hiring by firms to increase output .
due to capacity constraints , this increase in output will eventually become so small that the price of the good will rise .
at first , unemployment will go down , shifting ad1 to ad2 , which increases demand ( noted as " y " ) by ( y2 − y1 ) .
this increase in demand means more workers are needed , and then ad will be shifted from ad2 to ad3 , but this time much less is produced than in the previous shift , but the price level has risen from p2 to p3 , a much higher increase in price than in the previous shift .
this increase in price is called inflation .
demand-pull inflation is in contrast with cost-push inflation , when price and wage increases are being transmitted from one sector to another .
however , these can be considered as different aspects of an overall inflationary process : demand-pull inflation explains how price inflation starts , and cost-push inflation demonstrates why inflation once begun is so difficult to stop .
telecommunications in eritrea telecommunications in eritrea are under the authority of the government of eritrea .
the eritrea telecommunication services corporation , more commonly known as " eritel " , is the sole operator of both landline and mobile telephone communication infrastructure in eritrea .
however , it is one of several internet service providers in the country .
the domestic telecommunications infrastructure is very inadequate .
most fixed line telephones are located in asmara , the capital and largest city .
cell phones are in increasing use throughout the country .
the government is seeking international tenders to improve the system .
on *num* april *num* , eritrea received a soft loan from the government of china to upgrade their communication infrastructure .
the total sum loaned to eritel was $23 million .
all major cities are connected to the mobile telephone system in eritrea except for nakfa , afabet , and asseb , as of *num* .
afabet and nakfa are expected to be online by july *num* .
eritrea has not set up a widespread automatic internet filtering system , but it does not hesitate to order blocking of several diaspora websites critical of the regime .
access to these sites is blocked by two of the internet service providers , erson and ewan , as are pornographic websitesand youtube .
self-censorship is said to be widespread .
finlandization finlandization ( ; ; ) is the process by which one powerful country makes a smaller neighboring country abide by the former's foreign policy rules , while allowing it to keep its nominal independence and its own political system .
the term means " to become like finland " referring to the influence of the soviet union on finland's policies during the cold war .
the term is generally considered pejorative , originating in west german political debate of the late 1960s and 1970s .
as the term was used in germany and other nato countries , it referred to the decision of a country not to challenge a more powerful neighbour in foreign politics , while maintaining national sovereignty .
it is commonly used in reference to finland's policies in relation to the soviet union during the cold war , but it can refer more generally to similar international relations , such as denmark's attitude toward germany between *num* and *num* , or the policies of the swiss government towards nazi germany until the end of world war ii .
in germany , the term was used mainly by proponents of closer adaptation to us policies , chiefly franz josef strauss , but was initially coined in scholarly debate , and made known by the german political scientists walter hallstein and richard löwenthal , reflecting feared effects of withdrawal of us troops from germany .
it came to be used in the debate of the nato countries in response to willy brandt's attempts to normalise relations with east germany , and the following widespread scepticism in germany against nato's dual-track decision .
later , after the fall of the soviet union , the term has been used in finland for the post-1968 radicalisation in the latter half of the urho kekkonen era .
in finland , the term " finlandization " was perceived as blunt criticism , stemming from an inability to understand the practicalities of how a small nation needs to deal with an adjacent superpower without losing its sovereignty .
these practicalities existed especially because of the lingering effect of russian rule in their time , before the finns first gained sovereignty , and because of the precarious power balance eastwards , springing from a geographically extended yet sparsely populated state with a traditionally imperialist superpower right across the eastern border .
the reason finland engaged in finlandization was primarily realpolitik : to survive .
on the other hand , the threat of the soviet union was used also in finland's domestic politics in a way that possibly deepened finlandization ( playing the so-called " idänkortti " , " east card " ) .
finland cut such a deal with joseph stalin's government in the late 1940s , and it was largely respected by both parties—and to the gain of both parties—until the fall of the soviet union in *num* .
while the finnish political and intellectual elite mostly understood the term to refer more to the foreign policy problems of other countries , and meant mostly for domestic consumption in the speaker's own country , many ordinary finns considered the term highly offensive .
the finnish political cartoonist kari suomalainen once explained finlandization as " the art of bowing to the east without mooning the west " .
finland's foreign politics before this deal had been varied : independence from imperial russia with support of imperial germany in *num* ; participation in the russian civil war ( without official declaration of war ) alongside the triple entente 1918–1920 ; a non-ratified alliance with poland in *num* ; association with the neutralist and democratic scandinavian countries in the 1930s ended by the winter war ( *num* ) ; and finally in *num* , a rapprochement with nazi germany , the only power able and willing to help finland against the expansionist soviet union , which led to the nation's re-entry into the second world war in *num* .
the wehrmacht's defeat in the battle of stalingrad led finland to basically revert to its 19th-century traditions , which had been perceived as highly successful until the russification of finland ( 1899–1905 ) .
finland's leaders realised that opposing the soviets head-on was no longer feasible .
no international power was able to give the necessary support .
nazi germany , finland's chief supporter against russia , was losing the war .
sweden was not big enough , and its leadership was wary of confronting russia .
the western powers were allied with the soviet union .
thus finland had to face its big neighbour on its own , without any greater power's protection .
as in the *ord* century , finland chose not to challenge soviet russia's foreign policy , but exerted caution to keep its independence .
after the paris peace treaty of *num* , finland succeeded in retaining democracy and parliamentarism , despite the heavy political pressure on finland's foreign and internal affairs by the soviet union .
finland's foreign relations were guided by the doctrine formulated by juho kusti paasikivi , emphasising the necessity to maintain a good and trusting relationship with the soviet union .
finland signed an agreement of friendship , cooperation , and mutual assistance with the soviet union in april *num* , under which finland was obliged to resist armed attacks by " germany or its allies " against finland , or against the soviet union through finland , and , if necessary , ask for soviet military aid to do so .
at the same time , the agreement recognised finland's desire to remain outside great power conflicts , allowing the country to adopt a policy of neutrality during the cold war .
as a consequence , finland did not participate in the marshall plan and took neutral positions on soviet overseas initiatives .
by keeping very cool relations to nato and western military powers in general , finland could fend off soviet pressure for affiliation to the warsaw pact .
however , from the political scene following the post-1968 radicalisation , the soviet adaptation spread to the editors of mass media , sparking strong forms of self-control , self-censorship and pro-soviet attitudes .
most of the élite of media and politics shifted their attitudes to match the values that the soviets were thought to favor and approve .
only after the ascent of mikhail gorbachev to soviet leadership in *num* did mass media in finland gradually begin to criticise the soviet union more .
when the soviet union allowed non-communist governments to take power in eastern europe , gorbachev suggested they could look to finland as an example to follow .
in the years immediately after the war ( 1944–1946 ) , the soviet part of the allied control commission demanded that public libraries should remove from circulation more than *num* , *num* books that were deemed anti-soviet , and bookstores were given catalogs of banned books .
the finnish board of film classification likewise banned movies that it considered to be anti-soviet .
banned movies included " one , two , three " ( *num* film ) , directed by billy wilder , " the manchurian candidate " , directed by john frankenheimer in *num* , " one day in the life of ivan denisovich " *num* by finnish director caspar wrede and " born american " by finnish director renny harlin in *num* .
united states foreign policy experts consistently feared that western europe and japan would be finlandized , leading to a situation in which these key allies no longer supported the united states against the soviet union .
the theory of bandwagoning provided support for the idea that if the united states was not able to provide strong and credible support for the anti-communist positions of its allies , nato and the u .
s .
–japan alliance could collapse .
however , foreign policy scholars such as eric nordlinger in his book " isolationism reconfigured " have argued that " a vision of finlandization in america's absence runs up squarely against the european states ' long-standing communist antipathies and wariness of moscow's peaceful wiles , valued national traditions and strong democratic institutions , as well as their size and wherewithal " .
clodius clodius is an alternate form of the roman " nomen " claudius , a patrician " gens " that was traditionally regarded as sabine in origin .
the alternation of " o " and " au " is characteristic of the sabine dialect .
the feminine form is clodia .
the late republic , the spelling " clodius " is most prominently associated with publius clodius pulcher , a popularist politician who gave up his patrician status through an order in order to qualify for the office of tribune of the " plebs " .
clodius positioned himself as a champion of the urban " plebs " , supporting free grain for the poor and the right of association in guilds ( " collegia " ) ; because of this individual's ideology , " clodius " has often been taken as a more " plebeian " spelling and a gesture of political solidarity .
clodius's two elder brothers , the appius claudius pulcher who was consul in *num* bc and the c .
claudius pulcher who was praetor in *num* bc , conducted more conventional political careers and are referred to in contemporary sources with the traditional spelling .
the view that " clodius " represents a plebeian or politicized form has been questioned by clodius's chief modern-era biographer .
in " the patrician tribune " , w .
jeffrey tatum points out that the spelling is also associated with clodius's sisters and that " the political explanation … is almost certainly wrong .
" a plebeian branch of the " gens " , the claudii marcelli , retained the supposedly patrician spelling , while there is some inscriptional evidence that the " -o- " form may also have been used on occasion by close male relatives of the " patrician tribune " clodius .
tatum argues that the use of " -o- " by the " chic " clodia metelli was a fashionable affectation , and that clodius , whose perhaps inordinately loving relationship with his sister was the subject of much gossip and insinuation , was imitating his stylish sibling .
the linguistic variation of " o " for " au " was characteristic of the umbrian language , of which sabine was a branch .
forms using " o " were considered archaic or rustic in the 50s bc , and the use of " clodius " would have been either a whimsical gesture of pastoral fantasy , or a trendy assertion of antiquarian authenticity .
in addition to clodius , clodii from the republican era include : people using the name " clodius " during the period of the roman empire include : the clodii celsini continued to practice the traditional religions of antiquity in the face of christian hegemony through at least the *ord* century , when clodius celsinus adelphius ( see below ) converted .
business ethics business ethics ( also known as corporate ethics ) is a form of applied ethics or professional ethics , that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that can arise in a business environment .
it applies to all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire organizations .
these ethics originate from individuals , organizational statements or from the legal system .
these norms , values , ethical , and unethical practices are the principles that guide a business .
they help those businesses maintain a better connection with their stakeholders .
business ethics refers to contemporary organizational standards , principles , sets of values and norms that govern the actions and behavior of an individual in the business organization .
business ethics have two dimensions , normative business ethics or descriptive business ethics .
as a corporate practice and a career specialization , the field is primarily normative .
academics attempting to understand business behavior employ descriptive methods .
the range and quantity of business ethical issues reflects the interaction of profit-maximizing behavior with non-economic concerns .
interest in business ethics accelerated dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s , both within major corporations and within academia .
for example , most major corporations today promote their commitment to non-economic values under headings such as ethics codes and social responsibility charters .
adam smith said , " people of the same trade seldom meet together , even for merriment and diversion , but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public , or in some contrivance to raise prices .
" governments use laws and regulations to point business behavior in what they perceive to be beneficial directions .
ethics implicitly regulates areas and details of behavior that lie beyond governmental control .
the emergence of large corporations with limited relationships and sensitivity to the communities in which they operate accelerated the development of formal ethics regimes .
maintaining an ethical status is the responsibility of the manager of the business .
according to the journal of business ethics " "managing ethical behavior is one of the most pervasive and complex problems facing business organizations today"" business ethics reflect the norms of each historical period .
as time passes , norms evolve , causing accepted behaviors to become objectionable .
business ethics and the resulting behavior evolved as well .
business was involved in slavery , colonialism , and the cold war .
the term ' business ethics ' came into common use in the united states in the early 1970s .
by the mid-1980s at least *num* courses in business ethics reached *num* , *num* students , using some twenty textbooks and at least ten casebooks supported by professional societies , centers and journals of business ethics .
the society for business ethics was founded in *num* .
european business schools adopted business ethics after *num* commencing with the european business ethics network .
in *num* the first single-authored books in the field appeared .
firms began highlighting their ethical stature in the late 1980s and early 1990s , possibly in an attempt to distance themselves from the business scandals of the day , such as the savings and loan crisis .
the concept of business ethics caught the attention of academics , media and business firms by the end of the cold war .
however , criticism of business practices was attacked for infringing the freedom of entrepreneurs and critics were accused of supporting communists .
this scuttled the discourse of business ethics both in media and academia .
the defense industry initiative on business ethics and conduct ( dii ) was created to support corporate ethical conduct .
this era began the belief and support of self-regulation and free trade , which lifted tariffs and barriers and allowed businesses to merge and divest in an increasing global atmosphere .
one of the earliest written treatments of business ethics is found in the tirukkuṛaḷ , a tamil book dated variously from *num* bce to *ord* century ce and attributed to thiruvalluvar .
many verses discuss business ethics , in particular , verse *num* , adapting to a changing environment in verses *num* , *num* , and *num* , learning the intricacies of different tasks in verses *num* and *num* .
business ethics reflects the philosophy of business , of which one aim is to determine the fundamental purposes of a company .
if a company's purpose is to maximize shareholder returns , then sacrificing profits for other concerns is a violation of its fiduciary responsibility .
corporate entities are legally considered as persons in the united states and in most nations .
the ' corporate persons ' are legally entitled to the rights and liabilities due to citizens as persons .
ethics are the rules or standards that govern our decisions on a daily basis .
many consider “ethics” with conscience or a simplistic sense of “right” and “wrong .
” others would say that ethics is an internal code that governs an individual’s conduct , ingrained into each person by family , faith , tradition , community , laws , and personal mores .
corporations and professional organizations , particularly licensing boards , generally will have a written “code of ethics” that governs standards of professional conduct expected of all in the field .
it is important to note that “law” and “ethics” are not synonymous , nor are the “legal” and “ethical” courses of action in a given situation necessarily the same .
statutes and regulations passed by legislative bodies and administrative boards set forth the “law .
” slavery once was legal in the us , but one certainly wouldn’t say enslaving another was an “ethical” act .
economist milton friedman writes that corporate executives ' " responsibility .
.
.
generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to their basic rules of the society , both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom " .
friedman also said , " the only entities who can have responsibilities are individuals .
.
.
a business cannot have responsibilities .
so the question is , do corporate executives , provided they stay within the law , have responsibilities in their business activities other than to make as much money for their stockholders as possible ? and my answer to that is , no , they do not .
" a multi-country *num* survey found support for this view among the " informed public " ranging from *num* to *num* % .
ronald duska views friedman's argument as consequentialist rather than pragmatic , implying that unrestrained corporate freedom would benefit the most in long term .
similarly author business consultant peter drucker observed , " there is neither a separate ethics of business nor is one needed " , implying that standards of personal ethics cover all business situations .
however , peter drucker in another instance observed that the ultimate responsibility of company directors is not to harm—"primum non nocere " .
another view of business is that it must exhibit corporate social responsibility ( csr ) : an umbrella term indicating that an ethical business must act as a responsible citizen of the communities in which it operates even at the cost of profits or other goals .
in the us and most other nations corporate entities are legally treated as persons in some respects .
for example , they can hold title to property , sue and be sued and are subject to taxation , although their free speech rights are limited .
this can be interpreted to imply that they have independent ethical responsibilities .
duska argues that stakeholders have the right to expect a business to be ethical ; if the business has no ethical obligations , other institutions could make the same claim which would be counterproductive to the corporation .
ethical issues include the rights and duties between a company and its employees , suppliers , customers and neighbors , its fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders .
issues concerning relations between different companies include hostile take-overs and industrial espionage .
related issues include corporate governance ; corporate social entrepreneurship ; political contributions ; legal issues such as the ethical debate over introducing a crime of corporate manslaughter ; and the marketing of corporations ' ethics policies .
according to ibe / ipsos mori research published in late *num* , the three major areas of public concern regarding business ethics in britain are executive pay , corporate tax avoidance and bribery and corruption .
ethical standards of an entire organization can be damaged if a corporate psychopath is in charge .
this will not only affect the company and its outcome but the employees who work under a corporate psychopath .
the way a corporate psychopath can rise in a company is by their manipulation , scheming , and bullying .
they do this in a way that can hide their true character and intentions within a company .
fundamentally , finance is a social science discipline .
the discipline borders behavioral economics , sociology , economics , accounting and management .
it concerns technical issues such as the mix of debt and equity , dividend policy , the evaluation of alternative investment projects , options , futures , swaps , and other derivatives , portfolio diversification and many others .
finance is often mistaken by the people to be a discipline free from ethical burdens .
the *num* financial crisis caused critics to challenge the ethics of the executives in charge of u .
s .
and european financial institutions and financial regulatory bodies .
finance ethics is overlooked for another reason—issues in finance are often addressed as matters of law rather than ethics .
aristotle said , " the end and purpose of the polis is the good life " .
adam smith characterized the good life in terms of material goods and intellectual and moral excellences of character .
smith in his " the wealth of nations " commented , " all for ourselves , and nothing for other people , seems , in every age of the world , to have been the vile maxim of the masters of mankind .
" however , a section of economists influenced by the ideology of neoliberalism , interpreted the objective of economics to be maximization of economic growth through accelerated consumption and production of goods and services .
neoliberal ideology promoted finance from its position as a component of economics to its core .
proponents of the ideology hold that unrestricted financial flows , if redeemed from the shackles of " financial repressions " , best help impoverished nations to grow .
the theory holds that open financial systems accelerate economic growth by encouraging foreign capital inflows , thereby enabling higher levels of savings , investment , employment , productivity and " welfare " , along with containing corruption .
neoliberals recommended that governments open their financial systems to the global market with minimal regulation over capital flows .
the recommendations however , met with criticisms from various schools of ethical philosophy .
some pragmatic ethicists , found these claims to be unfalsifiable and a priori , although neither of these makes the recommendations false or unethical per se .
raising economic growth to the highest value necessarily means that welfare is subordinate , although advocates dispute this saying that economic growth provides more welfare than known alternatives .
since history shows that neither regulated nor unregulated firms always behave ethically , neither regime offers an ethical panacea .
neoliberal recommendations to developing countries to unconditionally open up their economies to transnational finance corporations was fiercely contested by some ethicists .
the claim that deregulation and the opening up of economies would reduce corruption was also contested .
dobson observes , " a rational agent is simply one who pursues personal material advantage ad infinitum .
in essence , to be rational in finance is to be individualistic , materialistic , and competitive .
business is a game played by individuals , as with all games the object is to win , and winning is measured in terms solely of material wealth .
within the discipline this rationality concept is never questioned , and has indeed become the theory-of-the-firm's sine qua non " .
financial ethics is in this view a mathematical function of shareholder wealth .
such simplifying assumptions were once necessary for the construction of mathematically robust models .
however , signalling theory and agency theory extended the paradigm to greater realism .
fairness in trading practices , trading conditions , financial contracting , sales practices , consultancy services , tax payments , internal audit , external audit and executive compensation also , fall under the umbrella of finance and accounting .
particular corporate ethical / legal abuses include : creative accounting , earnings management , misleading financial analysis , insider trading , securities fraud , bribery / kickbacks and facilitation payments .
outside of corporations , bucket shops and forex scams are criminal manipulations of financial markets .
cases include accounting scandals , enron , worldcom and satyam .
human resource management occupies the sphere of activity of recruitment selection , orientation , performance appraisal , training and development , industrial relations and health and safety issues .
business ethicists differ in their orientation towards labor ethics .
some assess human resource policies according to whether they support an egalitarian workplace and the dignity of labor .
issues including employment itself , privacy , compensation in accord with comparable worth , collective bargaining ( and / or its opposite ) can be seen either as inalienable rights or as negotiable .
discrimination by age ( preferring the young or the old ) , gender / sexual harassment , race , religion , disability , weight and attractiveness .
a common approach to remedying discrimination is affirmative action .
once hired , employees have the right to the occasional cost of living increases , as well as raises based on merit .
promotions , however , are not a right , and there are often fewer openings than qualified applicants .
it may seem unfair if an employee who has been with a company longer is passed over for a promotion , but it is not unethical .
it is only unethical if the employer did not give the employee proper consideration or used improper criteria for the promotion .
each employer should know the distinction between what is unethical and what is illegal .
if an action is illegal it is breaking the law but if an action seems morally incorrect that is unethical .
in the workplace what is unethical does not mean illegal and should follow the guidelines put in place by osha , eeoc , and other law binding entities .
potential employees have ethical obligations to employers , involving intellectual property protection and whistle-blowing .
employers must consider workplace safety , which may involve modifying the workplace , or providing appropriate training or hazard disclosure .
this differentiates on the location and type of work that is taking place and can need to comply with the standards to protect employees and non-employees under workplace safety .
larger economic issues such as immigration , trade policy , globalization and trade unionism affect workplaces and have an ethical dimension , but are often beyond the purview of individual companies .
trade unions for example , may push employers to establish due process for workers , but may also cause job loss by demanding unsustainable compensation and work rules .
unionized workplaces may confront union busting and strike breaking and face the ethical implications of work rules that advantage some workers over others .
among the many people management strategies that companies employ are a " soft " approach that regards employees as a source of creative energy and participants in workplace decision making , a " hard " version explicitly focused on control and theory z that emphasizes philosophy , culture and consensus .
none ensure ethical behavior .
some studies claim that sustainable success requires a humanely treated and satisfied workforce .
marketing ethics came of age only as late as the 1990s .
marketing ethics was approached from ethical perspectives of virtue or virtue ethics , deontology , consequentialism , pragmatism and relativism .
ethics in marketing deals with the principles , values and / or ideas by which marketers ( and marketing institutions ) ought to act .
marketing ethics is also contested terrain , beyond the previously described issue of potential conflicts between profitability and other concerns .
ethical marketing issues include marketing redundant or dangerous products / services transparency about environmental risks , transparency about product ingredients such as genetically modified organisms possible health risks , financial risks , security risks , etc .
, respect for consumer privacy and autonomy , advertising truthfulness and fairness in pricing & distribution .
according to borgerson , and schroeder ( *num* ) , marketing can influence individuals ' perceptions of and interactions with other people , implying an ethical responsibility to avoid distorting those perceptions and interactions .
marketing ethics involves pricing practices , including illegal actions such as price fixing and legal actions including price discrimination and price skimming .
certain promotional activities have drawn fire , including greenwashing , bait and switch , shilling , viral marketing , spam ( electronic ) , pyramid schemes and multi-level marketing .
advertising has raised objections about attack ads , subliminal messages , sex in advertising and marketing in schools .
being the most important element of a business , stakeholders ' main concern is to determine whether or not the business is behaving ethically or unethically .
the business ' actions and decisions should be primarily ethical before it happens to become an ethical or even legal issue .
" in the case of the government , community , and society what was merely an ethical issue can become a legal debate and eventually law .
" some unethical issues are : *num* .
fairness the three aspects that motivate people to be fair is ; equality , optimization , and reciprocity .
fairness is the quality of being just , equitable , and impartial .
*num* .
misuse of company's times & resources this particular topic may not seems to be a very common one , but it is very important , as it costs a company billions of dollars on a yearly basis .
this misuse is from late arrivals , leaving early , long lunch breaks , inappropriate sick days etc .
this has been observed as a major form of misconduct in businesses today .
one of the greatest ways employees participate in the misuse of company's time and resources is by using the company computer for personal use .
*num* .
consumer fraud there are many different types of fraud , namely ; friendly fraud , return fraud , wardrobing , price arbitrage , returning stolen goods .
fraud is a major unethical practice within businesses which should be paid special attention .
consumer fraud is when consumers attempt to deceive businesses for their very own benefit .
*num* .
abusive behavior a common ethical issue among employees .
abusive behavior consists of inflicting intimidating acts on other employees .
such acts include harassing , using profanity , threatening someone physically and insulting them , and being annoying .
this area of business ethics usually deals with the duties of a company to ensure that products and production processes do not needlessly cause harm .
since few goods and services can be produced and consumed with zero risks , determining the ethical course can be problematic .
in some case , consumers demand products that harm them , such as tobacco products .
production may have environmental impacts , including pollution , habitat destruction and urban sprawl .
the downstream effects of technologies nuclear power , genetically modified food and mobile phones may not be well understood .
while the precautionary principle may prohibit introducing new technology whose consequences are not fully understood , that principle would have prohibited the newest technology introduced since the industrial revolution .
product testing protocols have been attacked for violating the rights of both humans and animals .
with technology growing there are sources and websites that provide list and information on companies and business and that are " green " or do not test on animals .
these companies often advertise this and are growing in popularity among the younger generations .
the etymological root of property is the latin ' proprius ' which refers to ' nature ' , ' quality ' , ' one's own ' , ' special characteristic ' , ' proper ' , ' intrinsic ' , ' inherent ' , ' regular ' , ' normal ' , ' genuine ' , ' thorough , complete , perfect ' etc .
the word property is value loaded and associated with the personal qualities of propriety and respectability , also implies questions relating to ownership .
a ' proper ' person owns and is true to herself or himself , and is thus genuine , perfect and pure .
modern discourse on property emerged by the turn of the *ord* century within theological discussions of that time .
for instance , john locke justified property rights saying that god had made " the earth , and all inferior creatures , [ in ] common to all men " .
in *num* utilitarian jeremy bentham stated , " property and law are born together and die together " .
one argument for property ownership is that it enhances individual liberty by extending the line of non-interference by the state or others around the person .
seen from this perspective , property right is absolute and property has a special and distinctive character that precedes its legal protection .
blackstone conceptualized property as the " sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world , in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe " .
during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , slavery spread to european colonies including america , where colonial legislatures defined the legal status of slaves as a form of property .
during this time settlers began the centuries-long process of dispossessing the natives of america of millions of acres of land .
the natives lost about of land in the louisiana territory under the leadership of thomas jefferson , who championed property rights .
combined with theological justification , the property was taken to be essentially natural ordained by god .
property , which later gained meaning as ownership and appeared natural to locke , jefferson and to many of the *ord* and *ord* century intellectuals as land , labor or idea , and property right over slaves had the same theological and essentialized justification it was even held that the property in slaves was a sacred right .
wiecek noted , " slavery was more clearly and explicitly established under the constitution as it had been under the articles " .
accordingly , us supreme court chief justice roger b .
taney in his *num* judgment stated , " the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution " .
neoliberals hold that private property rights are a non-negotiable natural right .
davies counters with " property is no different from other legal categories in that it is simply a consequence of the significance attached by law to the relationships between legal persons .
" singer claims , " property is a form of power , and the distribution of power is a political problem of the highest order " .
rose finds , " 'property ' is only an effect , a construction , of relationships between people , meaning that its objective character is contestable .
persons and things , are ' constituted ' or ' fabricated ' by legal and other normative techniques .
" .
singer observes , " a private property regime is not , after all , a hobbesian state of nature ; it requires a working legal system that can define , allocate , and enforce property rights .
" davis claims that common law theory generally favors the view that " property is not essentially a ' right to a thing ' , but rather a separable bundle of rights subsisting between persons which may vary according to the context and the object which is at stake " .
in common parlance property rights involve a ' bundle of rights ' including occupancy , use and enjoyment , and the right to sell , devise , give , or lease all or part of these rights .
custodians of property have obligations as well as rights .
michelman writes , " a property regime thus depends on a great deal of cooperation , trustworthiness , and self-restraint among the people who enjoy it .
" menon claims that the autonomous individual , responsible for his / her own existence is a cultural construct moulded by western culture rather than the truth about the human condition .
penner views property as an " illusion"—a " normative phantasm " without substance .
in the neoliberal literature , the property is part of the private side of a public / private dichotomy and acts a counterweight to state power .
davies counters that " any space may be subject to plural meanings or appropriations which do not necessarily come into conflict " .
private property has never been a universal doctrine , although since the end of the cold war is it has become nearly so .
some societies , e .
g .
, native american bands , held land , if not all property , in common .
when groups came into conflict , the victor often appropriated the loser's property .
the rights paradigm tended to stabilize the distribution of property holdings on the presumption that title had been lawfully acquired .
property does not exist in isolation , and so property rights too .
bryan claimed that property rights describe relations among people and not just relations between people and things singer holds that the idea that owners have no legal obligations to others wrongly supposes that property rights hardly ever conflict with other legally protected interests .
singer continues implying that legal realists " did not take the character and structure of social relations as an important independent factor in choosing the rules that govern market life " .
ethics of property rights begins with recognizing the vacuous nature of the notion of property .
intellectual property ( ip ) encompasses expressions of ideas , thoughts , codes , and information .
" intellectual property rights " ( ipr ) treat ip as a kind of real property , subject to analogous protections , rather than as a reproducible good or service .
boldrin and levine argue that " government does not ordinarily enforce monopolies for producers of other goods .
this is because it is widely recognized that monopoly creates many social costs .
intellectual monopoly is no different in this respect .
the question we address is whether it also creates social benefits commensurate with these social costs .
" international standards relating to intellectual property rights are enforced through agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights .
in the us , ip other than copyrights is regulated by the united states patent and trademark office .
the us constitution included the power to protect intellectual property , empowering the federal government " "to promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries" " .
boldrin and levine see no value in such state-enforced monopolies stating , " we ordinarily think of innovative monopoly as an oxymoron .
further , they comment , ' intellectual property ' " is not like ordinary property at all , but constitutes a government grant of a costly and dangerous private monopoly over ideas .
we show through theory and example that intellectual monopoly is not necessary for innovation and as a practical matter is damaging to growth , prosperity , and liberty " .
steelman defends patent monopolies , writing , " consider prescription drugs , for instance .
such drugs have benefited millions of people , improving or extending their lives .
patent protection enables drug companies to recoup their development costs because for a specific period of time they have the sole right to manufacture and distribute the products they have invented .
" the court cases by *num* pharmaceutical companies against south africa's *num* medicines and related substances control amendment act , which intended to provide affordable hiv medicines has been cited as a harmful effect of patents .
one attack on ipr is moral rather than utilitarian , claiming that inventions are mostly a collective , cumulative , path dependent , social creation and therefore , no one person or firm should be able to monopolize them even for a limited period .
the opposing argument is that the benefits of innovation arrive sooner when patents encourage innovators and their investors to increase their commitments .
roderick long , a libertarian philosopher , observes , " ethically , property rights of any kind have to be justified as extensions of the right of individuals to control their own lives .
thus any alleged property rights that conflict with this moral basis—like the " right " to own slaves—are invalidated .
in my judgment , intellectual property rights also fail to pass this test .
to enforce copyright laws and the like is to prevent people from making peaceful use of the information they possess .
if you have acquired the information legitimately ( say , by buying a book ) , then on what grounds can you be prevented from using it , reproducing it , trading it ? is this not a violation of the freedom of speech and press ? it may be objected that the person who originated the information deserves ownership rights over it .
but information is not a concrete thing an individual can control ; it is universal , existing in other people's minds and other people's property , and over these , the originator has no legitimate sovereignty .
you cannot own information without owning other people " .
machlup concluded that patents do not have the intended effect of enhancing innovation .
self-declared anarchist proudhon , in his *num* seminal work noted , " monopoly is the natural opposite of competition , " and continued , " competition is the vital force which animates the collective being : to destroy it , if such a supposition were possible , would be to kill society" mindeli and pipiya hold that the knowledge economy is an economy of abundance because it relies on the " infinite potential " of knowledge and ideas rather than on the limited resources of natural resources , labor and capital .
allison envisioned an egalitarian distribution of knowledge .
kinsella claims that ipr create artificial scarcity and reduce equality .
bouckaert wrote , " natural scarcity is that which follows from the relationship between man and nature .
scarcity is natural when it is possible to conceive of it before any human , institutional , contractual arrangement .
artificial scarcity , on the other hand , is the outcome of such arrangements .
artificial scarcity can hardly serve as a justification for the legal framework that causes that scarcity .
such an argument would be completely circular .
on the contrary , artificial scarcity itself needs a justification " corporations fund much ip creation and can acquire ip they do not create , to which menon and others object .
andersen claims that ipr has increasingly become an instrument in eroding public domain .
ethical and legal issues include : patent infringement , copyright infringement , trademark infringement , patent and copyright misuse , submarine patents , biological patents , patent , copyright and trademark trolling , employee raiding and monopolizing talent , bioprospecting , biopiracy and industrial espionage , digital rights management .
notable ip copyright cases include napster , eldred v .
ashcroft and air pirates .
while business ethics emerged as a field in the 1970s , international business ethics did not emerge until the late 1990s , looking back on the international developments of that decade .
many new practical issues arose out of the international context of business .
theoretical issues such as cultural relativity of ethical values receive more emphasis in this field .
other , older issues can be grouped here as well .
issues and subfields include : the success of any business depends on its financial performance .
financial accounting helps the management to report and also , control the business performance .
the information regarding the financial performance of the company plays an important role in enabling people to take the right decision about the company .
therefore , it becomes necessary to understand how to record based on accounting conventions and concepts ensure unambling and accurate records .
foreign countries often use dumping as a competitive threat , selling products at prices lower than their normal value .
this can lead to problems in domestic markets .
it becomes difficult for these markets to compete with the pricing set by foreign markets .
in *num* , the international trade commission has been researching anti-dumping laws .
dumping is often seen as an ethical issue , as larger companies are taking advantage of other less economically advanced companies .
ethical issues often arise in business settings , whether through business transactions or forming new business relationships .
an ethical issue in a business atmosphere may refer to any situation that requires business associates as individuals , or as a group ( for example , a department or firm ) to evaluate the morality of specific actions , and subsequently make a decision amongst the choices .
some ethical issues of particular concern in today's evolving business market include such topics as : honesty , integrity , professional behaviors , environmental issues , harassment , and fraud to name a few .
it is integral to the success of an organization that ethics issues such as these be properly addressed and resolved .
businesses should strive to educate themselves on these issues , and ethical practices in general .
from a *num* national business ethics survey , it was found that types of employee-observed ethical misconduct included abusive behavior ( at a rate of *num* percent ) , discrimination ( at a rate of *num* percent ) , improper hiring practices ( at a rate of *num* percent ) , and company resource abuse ( at a rate of percent ) .
the ethical issues associated with honesty are widespread and vary greatly in business , from the misuse of company time or resources to lying with malicious intent , engaging in bribery , or creating conflicts of interest within an organization .
honesty encompasses wholly the truthful speech and actions of an individual .
some cultures and belief systems even consider honesty to be an essential pillar of life , such as confucianism and buddhism ( referred to as sacca , part of the four noble truths ) .
many employees lie in order to reach goals , avoid assignments or negative issues ; however , sacrificing honesty in order to gain status or reap rewards poses potential problems for the overall ethical culture organization , and jeopardizes organizational goals in the long run .
using company time or resources for personal use is also , commonly viewed as unethical because it boils down to stealing from the company .
the misuse of resources costs companies billions of dollars each year , averaging about *num* .
*num* hours per week of stolen time alone , and employees ' abuse of internet services is another main concern .
, ref name= " : / bribery , on the other hand , is not only considered unethical is business practices , but it is also illegal .
in accordance with this , the foreign corrupt practices act was established in *num* to deter international businesses from giving or receiving unwarranted payments and gifts that were intended to influence the decisions of executives and political officials .
although , small payments known as facilitation payments will not be considered unlawful under the foreign corrupt practices act if they are used towards regular public governance activities , such as permits or licenses .
many aspects of the work environment influence an individual's decision-making regarding ethics in the business world .
when an individual is on the path of growing a company , many outside influences can pressure them to perform a certain way .
the core of the person's performance in the workplace is rooted by their personal code of behavior .
a person's personal code of ethics encompasses many different qualities such as integrity , honesty , communication , respect , compassion , and common goals .
in addition , the ethical standards set forth by a person's superior ( s ) often translate into their own code of ethics .
the company's policy is the ' umbrella ' of ethics that play a major role in the personal development and decision-making processes that people make in respects to ethical behavior .
the ethics of a company and its ' individuals are heavily influenced by the state of their country .
if a country is heavily plagued with poverty , large corporations continuously grow , but smaller companies begin to wither and are then forced to adapt and scavenge for any method of survival .
as a result , the leadership of the company is often tempted to participate in unethical methods to obtain new business opportunities .
additionally , social media is arguably the most influential factor in ethics .
the immediate access to so much information and the opinions of millions highly influence people's behaviors .
the desire to conform with what is portrayed as the norm often manipulates our idea of what is morally and ethically sound .
popular trends on social media and the instant gratification that is received from participating in such quickly distort people's ideas and decisions .
political economy and political philosophy have ethical implications , particularly regarding the distribution of economic benefits .
john rawls and robert nozick are both notable contributors .
for example , rawls has been interpreted as offering a critique of offshore outsourcing on social contract grounds , whereas nozick's libertarian philosophy rejects the notion of any positive corporate social obligation .
“laws” are the written statutes , codes , and opinions of government organizations by which citizens , businesses , and persons present within a jurisdiction are expected to govern themselves or face legal sanction .
sanctions for violating the law can include ( a ) civil penalties , such as fines , pecuniary damages , and loss of licenses , property , rights , or privileges ; ( b ) criminal penalties , such as fines , probation , imprisonment , or a combination thereof ; or ( c ) both civil and criminal penalties .
very often it is held that business is not bound by any ethics other than abiding by the law .
milton friedman is the pioneer of the view .
he held that corporations have the obligation to make a profit within the framework of the legal system , nothing more .
friedman made it explicit that the duty of the business leaders is , " to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society , both those embodied in the law and those embodied in ethical custom " .
ethics for friedman is nothing more than abiding by ' customs ' and ' laws ' .
the reduction of ethics to abidance to laws and customs , however , have drawn serious criticisms .
counter to friedman's logic it is observed that legal procedures are technocratic , bureaucratic , rigid and obligatory whereas ethical act is conscientious , voluntary choice beyond normativity .
law is retroactive .
crime precedes law .
law against crime , to be passed , the crime must have happened .
laws are blind to the crimes undefined in it .
further , as per law , " conduct is not criminal unless forbidden by law which gives advance warning that such conduct is criminal " .
also , the law presumes the accused is innocent until proven guilty and that the state must establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt .
as per liberal laws followed in most of the democracies , until the government prosecutor proves the firm guilty with the limited resources available to her , the accused is considered to be innocent .
though the liberal premises of law is necessary to protect individuals from being persecuted by government , it is not a sufficient mechanism to make firms morally accountable .
as part of more comprehensive compliance and ethics programs , many companies have formulated internal policies pertaining to the ethical conduct of employees .
these policies can be simple exhortations in broad , highly generalized language ( typically called a corporate ethics statement ) , or they can be more detailed policies , containing specific behavioral requirements ( typically called corporate ethics codes ) .
they are generally meant to identify the company's expectations of workers and to offer guidance on handling some of the more common ethical problems that might arise in the course of doing business .
it is hoped that having such a policy will lead to greater ethical awareness , consistency in application , and the avoidance of ethical disasters .
an increasing number of companies also require employees to attend seminars regarding business conduct , which often include discussion of the company's policies , specific case studies , and legal requirements .
some companies even require their employees to sign agreements stating that they will abide by the company's rules of conduct .
many companies are assessing the environmental factors that can lead employees to engage in unethical conduct .
a competitive business environment may call for unethical behavior .
lying has become expected in fields such as trading .
an example of this are the issues surrounding the unethical actions of the salomon brothers .
not everyone supports corporate policies that govern ethical conduct .
some claim that ethical problems are better dealt with by depending upon employees to use their own judgment .
others believe that corporate ethics policies are primarily rooted in utilitarian concerns and that they are mainly to limit the company's legal liability or to curry public favor by giving the appearance of being a good corporate citizen .
ideally , the company will avoid a lawsuit because its employees will follow the rules .
should a lawsuit occur , the company can claim that the problem would not have arisen if the employee had only followed the code properly .
sometimes there is a disconnection between the company's code of ethics and the company's actual practices .
thus , whether or not such conduct is explicitly sanctioned by management , at worst , this makes the policy duplicitous , and , at best , it is merely a marketing tool .
jones and parker write , " most of what we read under the name business ethics is either sentimental common sense or a set of excuses for being unpleasant .
" many manuals are procedural form filling exercises unconcerned about the real ethical dilemmas .
for instance , the us department of commerce ethics program treats business ethics as a set of instructions and procedures to be followed by ' ethics officers ' .
, some others claim being ethical is just for the sake of being ethical .
business ethicists may trivialize the subject , offering standard answers that do not reflect the situation's complexity .
author of ' business ethics , ' richard degeorge writes in regard to the importance of maintaining a corporate code , " corporate codes have certain usefulness and there are several advantages to developing them .
first , the very exercise of doing so in itself is worthwhile , especially if it forces a large number of people in the firm to think through , in a fresh way , their mission and the important obligations they as a group and as individuals have to the firm , to each other , to their clients and customers , and to society as a whole .
second , once adopted a code can be used to generate continuing discussion and possible modification to the code .
third , it could help to inculcate in new employees at all levels the perspective of responsibility , the need to think in moral terms about their actions , and the importance of developing the virtues appropriate to their position .
" following a series of fraud , corruption , and abuse scandals that affected the united states defense industry in the mid-1980s , the defense industry initiative ( dii ) was created to promote ethical business practices and ethics management in multiple industries .
subsequent to these scandals , many organizations began appointing ethics officers ( also referred to as " compliance " officers ) .
in *num* , the ethics & compliance officer association ( ecoa ) —originally the ethics officer association ( eoa ) —was founded at the center for business ethics at bentley university as a professional association for ethics and compliance officers .
the *num* passing of the federal sentencing guidelines for organizations in *num* was another factor in many companies appointing ethics / compliance officers .
these guidelines , intended to assist judges with sentencing , set standards organizations must follow to obtain a reduction in sentence if they should be convicted of a federal offense .
following the high-profile corporate scandals of companies like enron , worldcom and tyco between *num* and *num* , and following the passage of the sarbanes–oxley act , many small and mid-sized companies also began to appoint ethics officers .
often reporting to the chief executive officer , ethics officers focus on uncovering or preventing unethical and illegal actions .
this is accomplished by assessing the ethical implications of the company's activities , making recommendations on ethical policies , and disseminating information to employees .
the effectiveness of ethics officers is not clear .
the establishment of an ethics officer position is likely to be insufficient in driving ethical business practices without a corporate culture that values ethical behavior .
these values and behaviors should be consistently and systemically supported by those at the top of the organization .
employees with strong community involvement , loyalty to employers , superiors or owners , smart work practices , trust among the team members do inculcate a corporate culture many corporate and business strategies now include sustainability .
in addition to the traditional environmental ' green ' sustainability concerns , business ethics practices have expanded to include social sustainability .
social sustainability focuses on issues related to human capital in the business supply chain , such as worker's rights , working conditions , child labor , and human trafficking .
incorporation of these considerations is increasing , as consumers and procurement officials demand documentation of a business ' compliance with national and international initiatives , guidelines , and standards .
many industries have organizations dedicated to verifying ethical delivery of products from start to finish , such as the kimberly process , which aims to stop the flow of conflict diamonds into international markets , or the fair wear foundation , dedicated to sustainability and fairness in the garment industry .
as mentioned , initiatives in sustainability encompass “green” topics , as well as social sustainability .
there are however many different ways in which sustainability initiatives can be implemented in a company .
improving operations : perhaps the most evident manner in which an organization can implement sustainability initiatives is by improving its operations and manufacturing’s process so as to make it more aligned with environment , social , and governance issues .
johnson & johnson incorporates policies from the universal declaration of human rights , international covenant on civil and political rights and international covenant on economic , social and cultural rights , applying these principles not only for members of its supply chain but also internal operations .
walmart has made commitments to doubling its truck fleet efficiency by *num* by replacing *num* / 3rds of its fleet with more fuel-efficient trucks , including hybrids .
dell has integrated alternative , recycled , and recyclable materials in its products and packaging design , improving energy efficiency and design for end-of-life and recyclability .
dell plans to reduce the energy intensity of its product portfolio by *num* % by *num* .
board leadership : the board of a company can decide to lower executive compensation by a given percentage , and give the percentage of compensation to a specific cause .
this is an effort which can only be implemented from the top , as it will affect the compensation of all executives in the company .
in alcoa , an aluminum company based in the usa , “1 / *ord* of executive cash compensation is tied to safety , diversity , and environmental stewardship , which includes greenhouse gas emission reductions and energy efficiency” ( best practices ) .
this is not usually the case for most companies , where we see the board take a uniform step towards the environment , social , and governance issues .
this is only the case for companies that are directly linked to utilities , energy , or material industries , something which alcoa as an aluminum company , falls in line with .
instead , formal committees focused on the environment , social , and governance issues are more usually seen in governance committees and audit committees , rather than the board of directors .
“according to research analysis done by pearl meyer in support of the nacd *num* director compensation report shows that among *num* , *num* public companies reviewed , only slightly more than five percent of boards have a designated committee to address esg issues .
” ( how compensation can ) .
management accountability : similar to board leadership , creating steering committees and other types of committees specialized for sustainability , senior executives are identified who are held accountable for meeting and constantly improving sustainability goals .
executive compensation : introducing bonus schemes that reward executives for meeting non-financial performance goals including safety targets , greenhouse gas emissions , reduction targets , and goals engaging stakeholders to help shape the companies public policy positions .
companies such as exelon have implemented policies like this .
stakeholder engagement : other companies will keep sustainability within its strategy and goals , presenting findings at shareholder meetings , and actively tracking metrics on sustainability .
companies such as pepsico , heineken , and fifco take steps in this direction to implement sustainability initiatives .
( best practices ) .
companies such as coca-cola have actively tried improve their efficiency of water usage , hiring *ord* party auditors to evaluate their water management approach .
fifco has also led successfully led water-management initiatives .
employee engagement : implementation of sustainability projects through directly appealing to employees ( typically through the human resource department ) is another option for companies to implement sustainability .
this involves integrating sustainability into the company culture , with hiring practices and employee training .
general electric is a company that is taking the lead in implementing initiatives in this manner .
bank of america directly engaged employees by implement leed ( leadership in energy and environmental design ) certified buildings , with a fifth of its building meeting these certifications .
supply chain management : establishing requirements for not only internal operations but also first-tier suppliers as well as second-tier suppliers to help drive environmental and social expectations further down the supply chain .
companies such as starbucks , fifco and ford motor company have implemented requirements that suppliers must meet to win their business .
starbucks has led efforts in engaging suppliers and local communities where they operate to accelerate investment in sustainable farming .
starbucks set a goal of ethically sourcing *num* % of its coffee beans by *num* .
releasing studies , insights , best practices and findings : by revealing decision making data about how sustainability was reached , companies are giving away insights that can help others across the industry and beyond make more sustainable decisions .
nike launched its “making app” in *num* which released data about the sustainability in the materials it was using .
this ultimately allows other companies to make more sustainable design decisions and create lower impact products .
as an academic discipline , business ethics emerged in the 1970s .
since no academic business ethics journals or conferences existed , researchers published in general management journals and attended general conferences .
over time , specialized peer-reviewed journals appeared , and more researchers entered the field .
corporate scandals in the earlier 2000s increased the field's popularity .
as of *num* , sixteen academic journals devoted to various business ethics issues existed , with journal of business ethics and business ethics quarterly considered the leaders .
the international business development institute is a global non-profit organization that represents *num* nations and all *num* united states .
it offers a charter in business development that focuses on ethical business practices and standards .
the charter is directed by harvard , mit , and fulbright scholars , and it includes graduate-level coursework in economics , politics , marketing , management , technology , and legal aspects of business development as it pertains to business ethics .
ibdi also oversees the international business development institute of asia which provides individuals living in *num* asian nations the opportunity to earn the charter .
in sharia law , followed by many muslims , banking specifically prohibits charging interest on loans .
traditional confucian thought discourages profit-seeking .
christianity offers the golden rule command , " therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you , do ye even so to them : for this is the law and the prophets .
" according to the article " theory of the real economy " , there is a more narrow point of view from the christianity faith towards the relationship between ethics and religious traditions .
this article stresses how christianity is capable of establishing reliable boundaries for financial institutions .
one criticism comes from pope benedict by describing the " damaging effects of the real economy of badly managed and largely speculative financial dealing .
" it is mentioned that christianity has the potential to transform the nature of finance and investment but only if theologians and ethicist provide more evidence of what is real in the economic life .
business ethics receives an extensive treatment in jewish thought and rabbinic literature , both from an ethical ( " mussar " ) and a legal ( " halakha " ) perspective ; see article " jewish business ethics " for further discussion .
according to the article " indian philosophy and business ethics : a review " , by chandrani chattopadyay , hindus follow " dharma " as business ethics and unethical business practices are termed " adharma " .
businessmen are supposed to maintain steady-mindedness , self-purification , non-violence , concentration , clarity and control over senses .
books like bhagavat gita and arthashastra contribute a lot towards conduct of ethical business .
business ethics is part of the philosophy of economics , the branch of philosophy that deals with the philosophical , political , and ethical underpinnings of business and economics .
business ethics operates on the premise , for example , that the ethical operation of a private business is possible—those who dispute that premise , such as libertarian socialists , ( who contend that " business ethics " is an oxymoron ) do so by definition outside of the domain of business ethics proper .
the philosophy of economics also deals with questions such as what , if any , are the social responsibilities of a business ; business management theory ; theories of individualism vs .
collectivism ; free will among participants in the marketplace ; the role of self interest ; invisible hand theories ; the requirements of social justice ; and natural rights , especially property rights , in relation to the business enterprise .
business ethics is also related to political economy , which is economic analysis from political and historical perspectives .
political economy deals with the distributive consequences of economic actions .
bakassi bakassi is a peninsula on the gulf of guinea .
it lies between the cross river estuary , near the city of calabar in the west of the bight of biafra , and the rio del ray estuary on the east .
it is governed by cameroon , following the transfer of sovereignty from neighbouring nigeria as a result of a judgment by the international court of justice .
on *num* november *num* , the nigerian senate rejected the transfer , since the greentree agreement ceding the area to cameroon was contrary to section *num* ( *num* ) of the *num* constitution .
regardless , the territory was transferred to cameroon on *num* august *num* .
the peninsula lies between latitudes 4°25′ and 5°10′n and longitudes 8°20′ and 9°08′e .
it consists of a number of low-lying , largely mangrove covered islands covering an area of around *num* km² ( *num* sq mi ) .
the population of bakassi is the subject of some dispute , but is generally put at between *num* , *num* and *num* , *num* people .
bakassi is situated at the extreme eastern end of the gulf of guinea , where the warm east-flowing guinea current ( called aya efiat in efik ) meets the cold north-flowing benguela current ( called aya ubenekang in efik ) .
these two ocean currents interact , creating huge foamy breakers which constantly advance towards the shore , and building submarine shoals rich in fish , shrimps , and a wide variety of other marine life forms .
this makes the bakassi area a very fertile fishing ground , comparable only to newfoundland in north america and scandinavia in western europe .
most of the population make their living through fishing .
the peninsula is commonly described as " oil-rich " , though in fact no commercially viable deposits of oil have been discovered .
however , the area has aroused considerable interest from oil companies in the light of the discovery of rich reserves of high grade crude oil in nigeria .
at least eight multinational oil companies have participated in the exploration of the peninsula and its offshore waters .
in october *num* , china petroleum & chemical corporation announced it had discovered new oil and gas resources in the bakassi region .
during the scramble for africa , queen victoria signed a treaty of protection with the king and chiefs of akwa akpa , known to europeans as old calabar on *num* september *num* .
this enabled the british empire to exercise control over the entire territory around calabar , including bakassi .
the territory subsequently became " de facto " part of nigeria , although the border was never permanently delineated .
however , documents released by the cameroonians , in parity with that of the british and germans , clearly places bakassi under cameroonian territory as a consequence of colonial era anglo-german agreements .
after southern cameroons voted in *num* to leave nigeria and became a part of cameroon , bakassi remained under calabar administration in nigeria until icj judgement of *num* .
bakassi inhabitants are mainly the oron people , the people of cross river state and akwa ibom state of nigeria .
nigeria and cameroon have disputed the possession of bakassi for some years , leading to considerable tension between the two countries .
in *num* the two countries went to the brink of war over bakassi and another area around lake chad , at the other end of the two countries ' common border .
more armed clashes broke out in the early 1990s .
in response , cameroon took the matter to the international court of justice ( icj ) on *num* march *num* .
the case was extremely complex , requiring the court to review diplomatic exchanges dating back over *num* years .
nigeria relied largely on anglo-german correspondence dating from *num* as well as treaties between the colonial powers and the indigenous rulers in the area , particularly the *num* treaty of protection .
cameroon pointed to the anglo-german treaty of *num* , which defined sphere of control in the region , as well as two agreements signed in the 1970s between cameroon and nigeria .
these were the yaoundé ii declaration of *num* april *num* and the maroua declaration of *num* june *num* , which were devised to outline maritime boundaries between the two countries following their independence .
the line was drawn through the cross river estuary to the west of the peninsula , thereby implying cameroonian ownership over bakassi .
however , nigeria never ratified the agreement , while cameroon regarded it as being in force .
the icj delivered its judgment on *num* october *num* , finding ( based principally on the anglo-german agreements ) that sovereignty over bakassi did indeed rest with cameroon .
it instructed nigeria to transfer possession of the peninsula , but did not require the inhabitants to move or to change their nationality .
cameroon was thus given a substantial nigerian population and was required to protect their rights , infrastructure and welfare .
the verdict caused consternation in nigeria .
it aroused vitriolic comments from nigerian officials and the nigerian media alike .
chief richard akinjide , a former nigerian attorney-general and minister of justice who had been a leading member of nigeria's legal team , described the decision as " *num* % international law and *num* % international politics " , " blatantly biased and unfair " , " a total disaster " , and a " complete fraud " .
the nigerian newspaper " the guardian " went further , declaring that the judgment was " a rape and unforeseen potential international conspiracy against nigerian territorial integrity and sovereignty " and " part of a western ploy to foment and perpetuate trouble in africa " .
the outcome of the controversy was a " de facto " nigerian refusal to withdraw its troops from bakassi and transfer sovereignty .
the nigerian government did not , however , openly reject the judgment but instead called for an agreement that would provide " peace with honour , with the interest and welfare of our people .
" the icj judgment was backed up by the united nations , whose charter potentially allowed sanctions or even the use of force to enforce the court's ruling .
secretary-general kofi annan stepped in as a mediator and chaired a tripartite summit with the two countries ' presidents on *num* november *num* , which established a commission to facilitate the peaceful implementation of the icj's judgement .
a further summit was held on *num* january *num* .
this has made significant progress , but the process has been complicated by the opposition of bakassi's inhabitants to being transferred to cameroon .
bakassian leaders threatened to seek independence if nigeria renounced sovereignty .
this secession was announced on *num* july *num* , as the " democratic republic of bakassi " .
the decision was reportedly made at a meeting on *num* july *num* and the vanguard newspaper of nigeria reported the decision to secede .
the decision was reportedly made by groups of militants including southern cameroons under the aegis of southern cameroons peoples organisation ( scapo ) , bakassi movement for self-determination ( bamosd ) , and the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta ( mend ) .
meanwhile , biafra secessionist organization , biafra nations youth league ( bnyl ) led by princewill obuka richard and ebuta ogar takon moved their national presence to the region after series of warning to nigeria government over the plight of the internally displaced natives and the reported killing of remnants in the peninsula by cameroon soldiers , this came amid clashes between nigeria troops and bakassi strike force , a militant group that rose against the plight of the displaced people , bnyl leaders were later apprehended in the ikang-cameroon border area on *num* november *num* by nigerian troops according to the nigeria nation newspaper , but that did not deter the group activities in bakassi .
on *num* june *num* , president olusegun obasanjo of nigeria and president paul biya of cameroon resolved the dispute in talks led by un secretary general kofi annan in new york city .
obasanjo agreed to withdraw nigerian troops within *num* days and to leave the territory completely in cameroonian control within the next two years .
annan said , " with today's agreement on the bakassi peninsula , a comprehensive resolution of the dispute is within our grasp .
the momentum achieved must be sustained .
" nigeria began to withdraw its forces , comprising some *num* , *num* troops , beginning *num* august *num* , and a ceremony on *num* august marked the formal handover of the northern part of the peninsula .
the remainder stayed under nigerian civil authority for two more years .
on *num* november *num* , the nigerian senate passed a resolution declaring that the withdrawal from the bakassi peninsula was illegal .
the government took no action , and handed the final parts of bakassi over to cameroon on *num* august *num* as planned , but a federal high court had stated this should be delayed until all accommodations for resettled bakassians had been settled ; the government did not seem to plan to heed this court order , and set the necessary mechanisms into motion to override it .
fishermen displaced from bakassi were first settled in a landlocked area called new bakassi , which they claimed was already inhabited and not suitable for fishermen like them but only for farmers .
the displaced people were then moved to akpabuyo , and eventually established a new community of dayspring .
despite the formal handover of bakassi by nigeria to cameroon in *num* , the territory of bakassi is still reflected as part of the *num* local governments in nigeria as embodied in the first schedule , part i of the *num* constitution of the federal republic of nigeria , *num* .
after the nigerian *num* general elections , nigeria's *ord* national assembly still accommodates the calabar-south / akpabuyo / bakassi federal constituency represented by hon .

diego de almagro diego de almagro ( ; – july *num* , *num* ) , also known as el adelantado and el viejo , was a spanish conquistador known for his exploits in western south america .
he participated with francisco pizarro in the spanish conquest of peru .
from peru almagro led an expedition that made him the second european to set foot in central chile ( after ) .
back in peru a longstanding conflict with pizarro over the control of the former inca capital of cuzco erupted into a civil war between the two bands of conquistadores .
in the battle of las salinas in *num* almagro was defeated by the pizarro brothers and months later he was executed .
the origins of diego de almagro remain obscure .
he was born in *num* in the village of almagro , *num* in ciudad real , where he took the surname for being the illegitimate son of juan de montenegro and elvira gutiérrez .
in order to save the honor of the mother , her relatives took her infant and moved him to the nearby town of bolaños de calatrava , being raised in this town and in aldea del rey , run by sancha lópez del peral .
when he turned *num* he returned to almagro , being under the tutelage of an uncle named hernán gutiérrez until he was *num* years old , when due to his uncle's hardness he ran away from home .
he went to the home of his mother , who was now living with her new husband , to tell her what had happened and that she was going to travel the world , asking for some bread to help her live in her misery .
his mother , anguished , gave him a piece of bread and some coins and said : " "take , son , and do not give me more pressure , and go , and god help in your adventure .
" " he went to seville and after probably stealing to survive the boy becomes a " criado " or servant and raised by don luis de polanco , one of the four mayors of the catholic kings and later his counselor , and who was mayor of that city .
while performing his duties as a servant , almagro stabbed another servant for certain differences , leaving him with injuries so serious that they motivated that a trial against him be promoted .
being wanted for justice , don luis de polanco , making use of his influence , got don pedro arias de avila to allow him to embark in one of the ships that would go to the new world from the port of sanlucar de barrameda .
the casa de contratacion demanded that the men who crossed the indies carry their own weapons , clothes , and farming tools , which don polanco provided to his servant .
diego de almagro arrived in the new world on june *num* , *num* , under the expedition that ferdinand ii of aragon had sent under the guidance of pedrarias dávila .
the expedition had landed in the city of santa maría la antigua del darién , panama , where many other future conquistadors had already arrived , among them francisco pizarro .
there are not many details of almagro's activities during this period , but it is known that he accompanied various sailors who departed from the city of darien between *num* and *num* .
de almagro eventually returned and settled in darien , where he was granted an encomienda .
he built a house and made a living from agriculture .
de almagro undertook his first conquest on november *num* , commanding *num* men as he founded villa del acla , named after the indian place .
due to illness he had to leave behind this mission to the licenciate gaspar de espinosa .
espinosa decided to undertake a new expedition , which departed in december *num* with *num* men , including de almagro and francisco pizarro , who for the first time was designated as a captain .
during this expedition , which lasted *num* months , de almagro , pizarro and hernando de luque became close friends .
also during this time de almagro established a friendship with vasco núñez de balboa , who was in charge of acla .
de almagro wanted to have a ship built with the remaining materials of the espinosa expedition , to be finished on the coast of the " great south sea " , as the pacific ocean was first called by the spanish .
current historians do not believe that de almagro was expected to participate in balboa's expedition and probably returned to darien .
de almagro took part in the various expeditions that took place in the gulf of panama , taking part again in espinosa's parties .
espinosa was supported by using balboa's ships .
de almagro was recorded as a witness on the lists of natives whom espinosa ordered to be carried .
de almagro remained as an early settler in the newly founded city of panama .
for four years he stayed there , working at the management of his properties and those of pizarro .
he took ana martínez , an indigenous woman , as a common-law wife .
in this period , his first son , el " mozo " , was born to them .
by *num* an association of conquest regarding south america was formalized among almagro , pizarro and luque .
by the beginning of august *num* , they had received the requisite permission to discover and conquer lands further south .
de almagro would remain in panama to recruit men and gather supplies for the expeditions led by pizarro .
after several expeditions to south america , pizarro secured his stay in peru with the " capitulation " on *num* july *num* .
during pizarro's continued exploration of incan territory , he and his men succeeded in defeating the inca army under emperor atahualpa during the battle of cajamarca in *num* .
de almagro joined pizarro soon afterward , bringing more men and arms .
after peru fell to the spanish , both pizarro and de almagro initially worked together in the founding of new cities to consolidate their dominions .
as such , pizarro dispatched de almagro to pursue quizquiz , fleeing to the inca empire's northern city of quito .
their fellow conquistador sebastián de belalcázar , who had gone forth without pizarro's approval , had already reached quito and witnessed the destruction of the city by inca general rumiñawi .
the inca warrior had ordered the city to be burned and its gold to be buried at an undisclosed location where the spanish could never find it .
the arrival of pedro de alvarado from guatemala , in search of inca gold further complicated the situation for almagro and belalcázar .
alvarado's presence , however , did not last long as he left south america in exchange for monetary compensation from pizarro .
in an attempt to claim quito ahead of belalcázar , in august *num* de almagro founded a city on the shores of laguna de colta ( colta lake ) in the foothills of chimborazo , some south of present-day quito , and named it " santiago de quito .
" four months later would come the foundation of the peruvian city of trujillo , which almagro named as " villa trujillo de nueva castilla " ( the village of trujillo in new castille ) in honor of francisco pizarro's birthplace , trujillo in extremadura , spain .
these events were the height of the pizarro-almagro friendship , which historians describe as one of the last events in which their friendship soon faded and entered a period of turmoil for the control of the incan capital of cuzco .
after splitting the treasure of inca emperor atahualpa , both pizarro and almagro left towards cuzco and took the city in *num* .
however , de almagro's friendship with pizarro showed signs of deterioration in *num* when pizarro , in the name of the rest of the conquistadors , called forth the " capitulacion de toledo " law in which king charles i of spain had laid out his authorization for the conquest of peru and the awards every conquistador would receive from it .
long before , however , each conquistador had promised to equally split the benefits .
pizarro managed to have a larger stake and awards for himself .
despite this , de almagro still obtained an important fortune for his services , and the king awarded him in november *num* the noble title of " don " and he was assigned a personal coat of arms .
although by this time diego de almagro had already acquired sufficient wealth in the conquest of peru and was living a luxurious life in cuzco , the prospect of conquering the lands further south was very attractive to him .
given that the dispute with pizarro over cuzco had kept intensifying , almagro spent a great deal of time and money equipping a company of *num* men for a new exploration south of peru .
by *num* the spanish crown had determined to split the region in two parallel lines , forming the governorship of " nueva castilla " ( from the 1° to the 14° latitude , close to pisco ) , and that of " nueva toledo " ( from the 14° to the 25° latitude , in taltal , chile ) , assigning the first to francisco pizarro and the second to diego de almagro .
the crown had previously assigned almagro the governorship of cuzco , and as such de almagro was heading there when charles v divided the territory between nueva castilla and nuevo toledo .
this might have been the reason why almagro did not immediately confront pizarro for cuzco , and promptly decided to embark on his new quest for the discovery of the riches of chile .
charles v had given diego a grant extending two hundred leagues south of francisco pizarro's .
francisco and diego concluded a new contract on *num* june *num* , in which they agreed to share future discoveries equally .
diego raised an expedition for chile , expecting it " would lead to even greater riches than they had found in peru .
" almagro prepared the way by sending ahead three of his spanish soldiers , the religious chief of the inca empire , willaq umu , and paullo topa , brother of manco inca yupanqui .
de almagro sent juan de saavedra forward with one hundred and fifty men , and soon followed them with additional forces .
saavedra established on january *num* , *num* the first spanish settlement in bolivia near the inca regional capital of paria .
almagro left cuzco on july *num* , *num* with his supporters and stopped at moina until the *ord* of that month .
meanwhile , francisco pizarro's brother , juan pizarro , had arrested inca manco inca yupanqui , further complicating de almagro's plans as it heavily increased the dissatisfaction of the indians submitted to spanish rule .
not having formally been appointed governor of any territories in the capitulation of toledo in *num* , however , forcing him to declare himself " adelantado " ( governor ) of nueva toledo , or southern peru and present-day chile .
some sources suggest almagro received such a requirement in *num* by the spanish king and was officially declared governor of new toledo .
once he left moina , de almagro followed the inca trail followed by *num* spaniards deciding to join him in quest for the gold lost in the ransom of atahualpa , which had mainly benefited the pizarro brothers and their supporters .
after crossing the bolivian mountain range and traveling past lake titicaca , almagro arrived on the shores of the desaguadero river and finally set up camp in tupiza .
from there , the expedition stopped at chicoana and then turned to the southeast to cross the andes mountains .
the expedition turned out to be a difficult and exhausting endeavor .
the hardest phase was the crossing of the andean cordilleras : the cold , hunger and tiredness meant the death of various spanish and natives , but mainly slaves who were not accustomed to such rigorous climate .
upon this point , de almagro determined everything was a failure .
he ordered a small group under rodrigo orgonez on a reconnaissance of the country to the south .
by luck , these men found the valley of copiapó , where gonzalo calvo barrientos , a spanish soldier whom pizarro had expelled from peru for stealing objects the inca had offered for his ransom , had already established a friendship with the local natives .
there , in the valley of the river copiapó , almagro took official possession of chile and claimed it in the name of king charles v .
de almagro promptly initiated the exploration of the new territory , starting up the valley the aconcagua river , where he was well received by the natives .
however , the intrigues of his interpreter , felipillo , who had previously helped pizarro in dealing with " atahualpa " , almost thwarted de almagro's efforts .
felipillo had secretly urged the local natives to attack the spanish , but they desisted , not understanding the dangers that they posed .
de almagro directed gómez de alvarado along with *num* horsemen and *num* foot to continue the exploration , which ended in the confluence of the ñuble and itata rivers .
the battle of reinohuelén between the spanish and hostile mapuche indians forced the explorers to return to the north .
de almagro's own reconnaissance of the land and the bad news of gómez de alvarado's encounter with the fierce mapuche , along with the bitter cold winter that settled ferociously upon them , only served to confirm that everything had failed .
he never found gold or the cities which incan scouts had told him lay ahead , only communities of the indigenous population who lived from subsistence agriculture .
local tribes put up fierce resistance to the spanish forces .
the exploration of the territories of nueva toledo , which lasted *num* years , was marked by a complete failure for de almagro .
despite this , at first he thought staying and founding a city would serve well for his honor .
the initial optimism that led almagro to bring his son he had with the indigenous panamanian ana martínez to chile had faded .
some historians have suggested that , but for the urging of his senior explorers , de almagro would probably have stayed permanently in chile .
he was urged to return to peru and this time take definitive possession of cuzco , so as to consolidate an inheritance for his son .
dismayed with his experience in the south , almagro made plans of return to peru .
he never officially founded a city in the territory of what is now chile .
the withdrawal of the spanish from valleys of chile was violent : almagro authorized his soldiers to ransack the natives ' properties , leaving their soil desolate .
in addition , the spanish soldiers took natives captive to serve as slaves .
the locals were captured , tied together , and forced to carry the heavy loads belonging to the conquistadors .
after the exhausting crossing of the atacama desert , mainly due to the weather conditions , almagro finally reached cuzco , peru , in *num* .
according to some authors , it was during this time that the spanish term " "roto" " ( torn ) , used by peruvians to refer to chileans , was first coined .
de almagro's disappointed troops returned to cuzco with their " torn clothes " due to the extensive and laborious passage on foot by the atacama desert .
after his return , de almagro was surprised to learn of the inca manco's rebellion .
diego de almagro sent an embassy to the inca , but they mistrusted all of the spaniards by this time .
hernando pizarro's men formed an uneasy truce with de almagro's men , surveying to determine the boundaries of their leaders ' royal grants .
they needed to determine in which portion the city of cuzco was located .
however , de almagro's troops quickly took the city and imprisoned the pizarro brothers , hernando and gonzalo , on the night of *num* april *num* .
after occupying cuzco , de almagro confronted an army sent by francisco pizarro to liberate his brothers .
alonso de alvarado commanded it and was defeated during the battle of abancay on july *num* , *num* .
he and some of his men were imprisoned .
later , gonzalo pizarro and de alvarado escaped prison .
subsequent negotiations between francisco pizarro and de almagro concluded with the liberation of hernando , the third pizarro brother , in return for conceding control and administration of cuzco to de almagro .
pizarro never intended to give up the city permanently , but was buying time to organize an army strong enough to defeat almagro's troops .
during this time almagro fell ill , and pizarro and his brothers grabbed the opportunity to defeat him and his followers .
the almagristas were defeated at las salinas in april *num* , with orgóñez being killed on the field of battle .
de almagro fled to cuzco , still in the hands of his loyal supporters , but found only temporary refuge ; the forces of the pizarro brothers entered the city without resistance .
once captured , almagro was humiliated by hernando pizarro and his requests to appeal to the king were ignored .
when diego de almagro begged for his life , hernando responded : "-he was surprised to see almagro demean himself in a manner so unbecoming a brave cavalier , that his fate was no worse than had befallen many a soldier before him ; and that , since god had given him the grace to be a christian , he should employ his remaining moments in making up his account with heaven ! " almagro was condemned to death and executed by " garrote " in his dungeon , and then decapitated , on july *num* , *num* .
his corpse was taken to the public plaza mayor of cuzco , where a herald proclaimed his crimes .
hernan ponce de leon took his body and buried him in the church of our lady of mercy in cuzco .
diego de almagro ii ( 1520–1542 ) , known as " el mozo " ( the lad ) , son of diego de almagro i , whose mother was an indian girl of panama , became the foil of the conspirators who had put pizarro to the sword .
pizarro was murdered on june *num* , *num* ; the conspirators promptly proclaimed the lad de almagro governor of peru .
from various causes , all of the conspirators either died or were killed except for one , who was executed after the lad almagro gave an order .
the lad de almagro fought the desperate battle of chupas on september *num* , *num* , escaped to cuzco , but was arrested , immediately condemned to death , and executed in the great square of the city .

the french astronomer nicolas louis de lacaille first described the constellation in french as " le fourneau chymique " ( the chemical furnace ) with an alembic and receiver in his early catalogue , before abbreviating it to " le fourneau " on his planisphere in *num* , after he had observed and catalogued almost *num* , *num* southern stars during a two-year stay at the cape of good hope .
he devised fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the southern celestial hemisphere not visible from europe .
all but one honoured instruments that symbolised the age of enlightenment .
lacaille latinised the name to " fornax chimiae " on his *num* chart .
the constellation eridanus borders fornax to the east , north and south , while cetus , sculptor and phoenix gird it to the north , west and south respectively .
covering *num* .
*num* square degrees and *num* .
*num* % of the night sky , it ranks *ord* of the *num* constellations in size , the three-letter abbreviation for the constellation , as adopted by the international astronomical union in *num* , is ' for ' .
the official constellation boundaries , as set by eugène delporte in *num* , are defined by a polygon of *num* segments ( " illustrated in infobox " ) .
in the equatorial coordinate system , the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between -23 .
76° and -39 .
58° .
the whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 50°n .
lacaille gave bayer designations to *num* stars now named alpha to omega fornacis , labelling two stars *num* .
*num* degrees apart as gamma , three stars eta , two stars iota , two lambda and three chi .
phi fornacis was added by gould , and theta and omicron were dropped by gould and baily respectively .
upsilon , too , was later found to be two stars and designated as such .
overall , there are *num* stars within the constellation's borders brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude *num* .
*num* .
however , there are no stars brighter than the fourth magnitude .
the three brightest stars form a flattish triangle , with alpha ( also called dalim ) and nu fornacis marking its eastern and western points and beta fornacis marking the shallow southern apex .
originally designated *num* eridani by john flamsteed , alpha fornacis was named by lacaille as the brightest star in the new constellation .
it is a binary star that can be resolved by small amateur telescopes .
with an apparent magnitude of *num* .

fornacis is a yellow-hued giant star of spectral type g8iiib of magnitude *num* .
*num* that has cooled and swelled to *num* times the sun's diameter , *num* ± *num* light-years from earth .
it is a red clump giant , which means it has undergone helium flash and is currently generating energy through the fusion of helium at its core .

it varies in luminosity over a period of *num* .
*num* days—the same as its rotational period .
this is because of differences in abundances of metals in its atmosphere ; it belongs to a class of star known as an alpha canum venaticorum variable .

six star systems in fornax have been found to have planets : ngc *num* is a globular cluster *num* , *num* light-years from earth .
it is in the fornax dwarf galaxy .
ngc *num* is a planetary nebula in fornax with a magnitude of approximately *num* .
*num* , *num* light-years from earth .
its central star is of magnitude *num* .
*num* , an unusually bright specimen .
it is five times the size of the famed ring nebula in lyra at *num* .
*num* arcminutes .
unlike the ring nebula , ngc *num* is clearly elliptical .
the fornax dwarf galaxy is a dwarf galaxy that is part of the local group of galaxies .
it is not visible in amateur telescopes , despite its relatively small distance of *num* , *num* light-years .
ngc *num* is a barred spiral galaxy in fornax , about *num* million light-years from earth .
at magnitude *num* , it is visible in medium amateur telescopes .
it is notable as a seyfert galaxy with strong spectral emissions indicating ionized gases and a central supermassive black hole .
ngc *num* is another barred spiral galaxy located at a distance of *num* million light-years from earth .
like ngc *num* , it is also a seyfert galaxy .
its bar is a center of star formation and shows extensions of the spiral arms ' dust lanes .
the bright nucleus indicates the presence of an active galactic nucleus - a galaxy with a supermassive black hole at the center , accreting matter from the bar .
it is a *ord* magnitude galaxy associated with the fornax cluster .
fornax a is a radio galaxy with extensive radio lobes that corresponds to the optical galaxy ngc *num* , a 9th-magnitude galaxy .
one of the closer active galaxies to earth at a distance of *num* million light-years , fornax a appears in the optical spectrum as a large elliptical galaxy with dust lanes near its core .
these dust lanes have caused astronomers to discern that it recently merged with a small spiral galaxy .
because it has a high rate of type ia supernovae , ngc *num* has been used to determine the size of the universe .
the jets producing the radio lobes are not particularly powerful , giving the lobes a more diffuse , knotted structure due to interactions with the intergalactic medium .
associated with this peculiar galaxy is an entire cluster of galaxies .
fornax has been the target of investigations into the furthest reaches of the universe .
the hubble ultra deep field is located within fornax , and the fornax cluster , a small cluster of galaxies , lies primarily within fornax .
at a meeting of the royal astronomical society in britain , a team from university of queensland described *num* unknown " dwarf " galaxies in this constellation ; follow-up observations with the hubble space telescope and the european southern observatory's very large telescope revealed that ultra compact dwarfs are much smaller than previously known dwarf galaxies , about across .
udfj-39546284 is a candidate protogalaxy located in fornax , although recent analyses have suggested it is likely to be a lower redshift source .
in chinese astronomy , the stars that correspond to fornax are within the white tiger of the west ( 西方白虎 , " xī fāng bái hǔ " ) .
politics of djibouti politics of djibouti takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic , whereby the executive power is exercised by the president and the government .
legislative power is vested in both the government and the national assembly .
the party system and legislature are dominated by the socialist people's rally for progress .
in april *num* , a new constitutional amendment was approved .
the president serves as both the head of state and head of government , and is directly elected for single six-year term .
government is headed by the president , who appoints the prime minister and the council of ministers on the proposal of the latter .
there is also a 65-member chamber of deputies , where representatives are popularly elected for terms of five years .
administratively , the country is divided into five regions and one city , with eleven additional district subdivisions .
djibouti is also part of various international organisations , including the united nations and arab league .
in *num* , on the eve of neighboring somalia's independence in *num* , a referendum was held in djibouti to decide whether to join the somali republic or to remain with france .
the referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with france , partly due to a combined " yes " vote by the sizeable afar ethnic group and resident europeans .
there was also widespread vote rigging , with the french expelling thousands of somalis before the referendum reached the polls .
the majority of those who had voted " no " were somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united somalia as had been proposed by mahmoud harbi , vice president of the government council .
harbi was killed in a plane crash two years later .
in *num* , a second plebiscite was held to determine the fate of the territory .
initial results supported a continued but looser relationship with france .
voting was also divided along ethnic lines , with the resident somalis generally voting for independence , with the goal of eventual union with somalia , and the afars largely opting to remain associated with france .
however , the referendum was again marred by reports of vote rigging on the part of the french authorities .
shortly after the referendum was held , the former " côte française des somalis " ( french somaliland ) was renamed to " territoire français des afars et des issas " .
in *num* , a third referendum took place .
a landslide *num* .
*num* % of the electorate supported disengagement from france , officially marking djibouti's independence .
hassan gouled aptidon , a somali politician who had campaigned for a " yes " vote in the referendum of *num* , eventually wound up as the nation's first president ( 1977–1999 ) .
he was re-elected , unopposed , to a second 6-year term in april *num* and to a third 6-year term in may *num* multiparty elections .
the electorate approved the current constitution in september *num* .
many laws and decrees from before independence remain in effect .
in early *num* , the government decided to permit multiple party politics and agreed to the registration of four political parties .
by the time of the national assembly elections in december *num* , only three had qualified .
they are the " rassemblement populaire pour le progres " ( people's rally for progress ) ( rpp ) which was the only legal party from *num* until *num* , the " parti du renouveau démocratique " ( the party for democratic renewal ) ( prd ) , and the " parti national démocratique " ( national democratic party ) ( pnd ) .
only the rpp and the prd contested the national assembly elections , and the pnd withdrew , claiming that there were too many unanswered questions on the conduct of the elections and too many opportunities for government fraud .
the rpp won all *num* seats in the national assembly , with a turnout of less than *num* % of the electorate .
in *num* , president aptidon's chief of staff , head of security , and key adviser for over *num* years , ismail omar guelleh was elected to the presidency as the rpp candidate .
he received *num* % of the vote , the other *num* % going to opposition candidate moussa ahmed idriss , of the unified djiboutian opposition ( odu ) .
for the first time since independence , no group boycotted the election .
moussa ahmed idriss and the odu later challenged the results based on election " irregularities " and the assertion that " foreigners " had voted in various districts of the capital ; however , international and locally based observers considered the election to be generally fair , and cited only minor technical difficulties .
guelleh took the oath of office as the second president of the republic of djibouti on may *num* , *num* , with the support of an alliance between the rpp and the government-recognised section of the afar-led frud .
currently , political power is shared by a somali issa president and an afar prime minister , with cabinet posts roughly divided .
however , it is the issas who dominate the government , civil service , and the ruling party , a situation that has bred resentment and political competition between the somali issas and the afars .
the government is dominated by the somali issa mamasen , who enjoy the support of the somali clans , especially the isaaq ( the clan of the current president's wife ) and the gadabuursi dir ( who are the second most prominent somali clan in djibouti politics ) .
in early november *num* , civil war erupted in djibouti between the government and a predominantly afar rebel group , the front for the restoration of unity and democracy ( frud ) .
the frud signed a peace accord with the government in december *num* , ending the conflict .
two frud members were subsequently made cabinet members , and in the presidential elections of *num* the frud campaigned in support of the rpp .
in february *num* , another branch of frud signed a peace accord with the government .
on *num* may *num* , president ismail omar guelleh presided over the signing of what is termed the final peace accord officially ending the decade-long civil war between the government and the armed faction of the frud .
the treaty successfully completed the peace process begun on *num* february *num* in paris , with ahmed dini ahmed representing the frud .
on *num* april *num* , president guelleh was sworn in for his second six-year term after a one-man election .
he took *num* % of the votes in a *num* .
*num* % turnout .
in early *num* , the djiboutian citizenry took part in a series of protests against the long-serving government , which were associated with the larger arab spring demonstrations .
guelleh was re-elected to a third term later that year , with *num* .
*num* % of the vote in a *num* % turnout .
although opposition groups boycotted the ballot over changes to the constitution permitting guelleh to run again for office , international observers generally described the election as free and fair .
on *num* march *num* , guelleh replaced long-serving prime minister dilleita mohamed dilleita with former president of the union for a presidential majority ( ump ) abdoulkader kamil mohamed .
the president is directly elected by popular vote for a six-year term .
the prime minister is appointed by the president , and the council of ministers is solely responsible to the president , as specified in .
djibouti is sectioned into five administrative regions and one city : ali sabieh region , arta region , dikhil region , djibouti region , obock region and tadjourah region .
the country is further sub-divided into eleven districts .
goodness ( band ) goodness was an american rock band from seattle , washington , led by carrie akre , formerly of hammerbox and now primarily a solo artist .
goodness featured akre ( vocals ) , danny newcomb ( lead guitar ) , garth reeves ( guitar ) , fiia mcgann ( bass ) , and chris friel ( drums ) .
akre , friel , and newcomb later joined mike mccready of pearl jam and rick friel to form the rock band the rockfords .
goodness recorded a version of " electricity , electricity " with mike mccready using the pseudonym " petster " on electric guitar for the " schoolhouse rock ! rocks " tribute disc on lava / atlantic .
they released their self-titled debut album in *num* on y records , followed in *num* by anthem on immortal / epic and later these days on good ink .
two live albums were released via kufala recordings in *num* .
goodness toured extensively all over the world , supporting such acts as pearl jam , cheap trick , and oasis .
they co-headlined a tour with candlebox .
goodness reunited for shows at the tractor tavern in ballard on november *num* , *num* and may *num* , *num* .
they last played at neumo's on january *num* , *num* .
crony capitalism crony capitalism is an economy in which businesses thrive not as a result of risk , but rather as a return on money amassed through a nexus between a business class and the political class .
this is done using state power to crush genuine competition in handing out permits , government grants , special tax breaks , or other forms of state intervention over resources where the state exercises monopolist control over public goods , for example , mining concessions for primary commodities or contracts for public works .
money is then made not merely by making a profit in the market , but through profiteering by " rent seeking " using this monopoly or oligopoly .
entrepreneurship and innovative practices , which seek to reward risk are stifled , since the value-added is little by crony businesses as hardly anything of significant value is created by them , with transactions taking the form of " trading " .
crony capitalism spills over into the government , the politics and the media , when this nexus distorts the economy and affects society to an extent it corrupts public-serving economic , political and social ideals .
the term " crony capitalism " made a significant impact in the public as an explanation of the asian financial crisis .
it is also used to describe governmental decisions favoring " cronies " of governmental officials .
in this context , the term is often used comparatively with corporate welfare , a technical term often used to assess government bailouts and favoritistic monetary policy , as opposed to the economic theory , described by " crony capitalism " .
the extent of difference between these terms is whether a government action can be said to benefit the individuals rather than the industry .
crony capitalism exists along a continuum .
in its lightest form , crony capitalism consists of collusion among market players which is officially tolerated or encouraged by the government .
while perhaps lightly competing against each other , they will present a unified front ( sometimes called a trade association or industry trade group ) to the government in requesting subsidies or aid or regulation .
newcomers to a market then need to surmount significant " barriers to entry " for instance , in seeking loans , acquire shelf space , or receive official sanction .
some such systems are very formalized , such as sports leagues and the medallion system of the taxicabs of new york city , but often the process is more subtle , such as expanding training and certification exams to make it more expensive for new entrants to enter a market and thereby limit competition .
in technological fields , there may evolve a system whereby new entrants may be accused of infringing on patents that the established competitors never assert against each other .
in spite of this , some competitors may succeed when the legal barriers are light .
the term crony capitalism is generally used when these practices come to dominate the economy as a whole or to dominate the most valuable industries in an economy .
intentionally ambiguous laws and regulations are common in such systems .
taken strictly , such laws would greatly impede practically all business ; in practice , they are only erratically enforced .
the specter of having such laws suddenly brought down upon a business provides incentive to stay in the good graces of political officials .
troublesome rivals who have overstepped their bounds can have the laws suddenly enforced against them , leading to fines or even jail time .
even in high-income democracies with well-established legal systems and freedom of the press in place , a larger state is associated with more political corruption .
the term " crony capitalism " was initially applied to states involved in the *num* asian financial crisis such as thailand and indonesia .
in these cases , the term was used to point out how family members of the ruling leaders become extremely wealthy with no non-political justification .
southeast asian nations still score very poorly in rankings measuring this .
hong kong , and malaysia are perhaps most noted for this , and the term has also been applied to the system of oligarchs in russia .
other states to which the term has been applied include india , in particular , the system after the 1990s liberalization whereby land and other resources were given at throwaway prices in the name of public private partnerships , the more recent coal-gate scam and cheap allocation of land and resources to adani sez under the congress and bjp governments .
similar references to crony capitalism have been made to other countries such as argentina and greece .
wu jinglian , one of china's leading economists and a longtime advocate of its transition to free markets , says that it faces two starkly contrasting futures : a market economy under the rule of law or crony capitalism .
a dozen years later , prominent political scientist pei minxin had concluded that the latter course had become deeply embedded in china .
many prosperous nations have also had varying amounts of cronyism throughout their history including the united kingdom , especially in the 1600s and 1700s , united states , and japan .
"the economist " benchmarks countries based on a " crony-capitalism index " calculated via how much economic activity occurs in industries prone to cronyism .
its *num* crony capitalism index ranking listed hong kong , russia and malaysia in the top *num* spots .
crony capitalism in finance was found in the second bank of the united states .
it was a private company , but its largest stockholder was the federal government which owned *num* % .
it was an early bank regulator and grew to be one being the most powerful organizations in the country due largely to being the depository of the government's revenue .
the gramm-leach-bliley act in *num* completely removed glass-steagall’s separation between commercial banks and investment banks .
after this repeal , commercial banks , investment banks , and insurance companies combined their lobbying efforts .
critics claim this was instrumental in the passage of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of *num* .
more direct government involvement in a specific sector can also lead to specific areas of crony capitalism , even if the economy as a whole may be competitive .
this is most common in natural resource sectors through the granting of mining or drilling concessions , but it is also possible through a process known as regulatory capture where the government agencies in charge of regulating an industry come to be controlled by that industry .
governments will often , in good faith , establish government agencies to regulate an industry .
however , the members of an industry have a very strong interest in the actions of that regulatory body , while the rest of the citizenry are only lightly affected .
as a result , it is not uncommon for current industry players to gain control of the " watchdog " and to use it against competitors .
this typically takes the form of making it very expensive for a new entrant to enter the market .
an *num* landmark u .
s .
supreme court ruling overturned a new york state-granted monopoly ( " a veritable model of state munificence " facilitated by one of the founding fathers , robert r .
livingston ) for the then-revolutionary technology of steamboats .
leveraging the supreme court's establishment of congressional supremacy over commerce , the interstate commerce commission was established in *num* with the intent of regulating railroad " robber barons " .
president grover cleveland appointed thomas m .
cooley , a railroad ally , as its first chairman and a permit system was used to deny access to new entrants and legalize price fixing .
the defense industry in the united states is often described as an example of crony capitalism in an industry .
connections with the pentagon and lobbyists in washington are described by critics as more important than actual competition , due to the political and secretive nature of defense contracts .
in the airbus-boeing wto dispute , airbus ( which receives outright subsidies from european governments ) has stated boeing receives similar subsidies , which are hidden as inefficient defense contracts .
other american defense companies were put under scrutiny for no-bid contracts for iraq war and hurricane katrina related contracts purportedly due to having cronies in the bush administration .
gerald p .
o'driscoll , former vice president at the federal reserve bank of dallas , stated that fannie mae and freddie mac became examples of crony capitalism .
government backing let fannie and freddie dominate mortgage underwriting .
" the politicians created the mortgage giants , which then returned some of the profits to the pols—sometimes directly , as campaign funds ; sometimes as " contributions " to favored constituents .
" in its worst form , crony capitalism can devolve into simple corruption , where any pretense of a free market is dispensed with .
bribes to government officials are considered " de rigueur " and tax evasion is common ; this is seen in many parts of africa , for instance .
this is sometimes called plutocracy ( rule by wealth ) or kleptocracy ( rule by theft ) .
corrupt governments may favor one set of business owners who have close ties to the government over others .
this may also be done with , religious , or ethnic favoritism ; for instance , alawites in syria have a disproportionate share of power in the government and business there .
( president assad is an alawite .
) this can be explained by considering personal relationships as a social network .
as government and business leaders try to accomplish various things , they naturally turn to other powerful people for support in their endeavors .
these people form hubs in the network .
in a developing country those hubs may be very few , thus concentrating economic and political power in a small interlocking group .
normally , this will be untenable to maintain in business ; new entrants will affect the market .
however , if business and government are entwined , then the government can maintain the small-hub network .
raymond vernon , specialist in economics and international affairs , wrote that the industrial revolution began in great britain , because they were the first to successfully limit the power of veto groups ( typically cronies of those with power in government ) to block innovations .
" unlike most other national environments , the british environment of the early *ord* century contained relatively few threats to those who improved and applied existing inventions , whether from business competitors , labor , or the government itself .
in other european countries , by contrast , the merchant guilds .
.
.
were a pervasive source of veto for many centuries .
this power was typically bestowed upon them by government " .
for example , a russian inventor produced a steam engine in *num* and disappeared without a trace .
" [ a ] steam powered horseless carriage produced in france in *num* was officially suppressed .
" james watt began experimenting with steam in *num* , got a patent in *num* , and began commercial production in *num* .
raghuram rajan , former governor of the reserve bank of india , has said " one of the greatest dangers to the growth of developing countries is the middle income trap , where crony capitalism creates oligarchies that slow down growth .
if the debate during the elections is any pointer , this is a very real concern of the public in india today .
" tavleen singh , columnist for " the indian express " has disagreed .
according to her , india's corporate success is not a product of crony capitalism , but because india is no longer under the influence of crony socialism .
while the problem is generally accepted across the political spectrum , ideology shades the view of the problem's causes and therefore its solutions .
political views mostly fall into two camps which might be called the socialist and capitalist critique .
the socialist position is that crony capitalism is the inevitable result of any strictly capitalist system and thus broadly democratic government must regulate economic , or wealthy , interests in order to restrict monopoly .
the capitalist position is that " natural monopolies " are rare , therefore governmental regulations generally abet established wealthy interests by restricting competition .
critics of crony capitalism including socialists and anti-capitalists often assert that crony capitalism is the inevitable result of any strictly capitalist system .
jane jacobs described it as a natural consequence of collusion between those managing power and trade while noam chomsky has argued that the word " crony " is superfluous when describing capitalism .
since businesses make money and money leads to political power , business will inevitably use their power to influence governments .
much of the impetus behind campaign finance reform in the united states and in other countries is an attempt to prevent economic power being used to take political power .
ravi batra argues that " all official economic measures adopted since *num* [ .
.
.
] have devastated the middle class " and that the occupy wall street movement should push for their repeal and thus end the influence of the super wealthy in the political process , which he considers a manifestation of crony capitalism .
socialist economists , such as robin hahnel , have criticized the term as an ideologically motivated attempt to cast what is in their view the fundamental problems of capitalism as avoidable irregularities .
socialist economists dismiss the term as an apologetic for failures of neoliberal policy and more fundamentally their perception of the weaknesses of market allocation .
supporters of capitalism generally oppose crony capitalism as well and consider it an aberration brought on by governmental favors incompatible with free market .
proponents of capitalism tend to regard the term as an oxymoron , arguing that crony capitalism is not capitalism at all .
in the capitalist view , " cronyism " is the result of an excess of interference in the market , which inherently will result in a toxic combination of corporations and government officials running the sector of the economy .
some advocates prefer to equate this problem with terms such as " corporatocracy " or " corporatism , a modern form of mercantilism " to emphasize that the only way to run a profitable business in such a system is to have help from corrupt government officials .
even if the initial regulation was well-intentioned ( to curb actual abuses ) and even if the initial lobbying by corporations was well-intentioned ( to reduce illogical regulations ) , the mixture of business and government stifle competition , a collusive result called regulatory capture .
burton w .
folsom jr .
distinguishes those that engage in crony capitalism—designated by him " political entrepreneurs"—from those who compete in the marketplace without special aid from government , whom he calls " market entrepreneurs " .
the market entrepreneurs , such as hill , vanderbilt and rockefeller , succeeded by producing a quality product at a competitive price .
the political entrepreneurs , for example , edward collins in steamships and the leaders of the union pacific railroad in railroads , were men who used the power of government to succeed .
they tried to gain subsidies or in some way use government to stop competitors .
aeolus in greek mythology , aeolus ( ; , " aiolos " , modern greek : " quick-moving , nimble " ) is a name shared by three mythical characters .
these three personages are often difficult to tell apart , and even the ancient mythographers appear to have been perplexed about which aeolus was which .
diodorus siculus made an attempt to define each of these three ( although it is clear that he also became muddled ) , and his opinion is followed here .
all three men named aeolus appear to be connected genealogically , although the precise relationship , especially regarding the second and third aeolus , is often ambiguous as their identities seem to have been merged by many ancient writers .
fc den bosch fc den bosch ( ) is a football club from ' s-hertogenbosch , netherlands .
they were founded *num* august *num* , as fc den bosch / bvv .
they are the successor of bvv ( *num* ) and wilhelmina ( *num* ) .
their stadium is called ' de vliert ' , an *num* , *num* all-seater .
ruud van nistelrooy started his professional career at this club .
in *num* they finished bottom of the eredivisie and were relegated .
below is a table with fc den bosch's domestic results since the introduction of professional football in *num* .
during the 2012–13 knvb cup quarter-final match against az , american forward jozy altidore was the target of racist chants .
the club's director , peter bijvelds , blamed " malicious supporters making a scandalous mess of the evening " .
he said den bosch , az and the referee considered abandoning the match , but decided against it .
"we can't deny that , certainly when we play top matches , we have a structural problem with a group of people who ruin things " , bijvelds told dutch radio .
this racial incident , however , was a minor one , and gravely offended the vast majority of den bosch supporters .
following this incident , the club and fans went on a series of actions to rectify the image of the club and re-instate their strong stance against any forms of racism .
evident to this was a campaign launched by the club to equip a village in africa with football kits and football equipment .
alfred korzybski alfred habdank skarbek korzybski ( ; july *num* , *num* – march *num* , *num* ) was a polish-american independent scholar who developed a field called general semantics , which he viewed as both distinct from , and more encompassing than , the field of semantics .
he argued that human knowledge of the world is limited both by the human nervous system and the languages humans have developed , and thus no one can have direct access to reality , given that the most we can know is that which is filtered through the brain's responses to reality .
his best known dictum is " the map is not the territory " .
born in warsaw , poland , then part of the russian empire , korzybski belonged to an aristocratic polish family whose members had worked as mathematicians , scientists , and engineers for generations .
he learned the polish language at home and the russian language in schools ; and having a french and german governess , he became fluent in four languages as a child .
korzybski studied engineering at the warsaw university of technology .
during the first world war ( 1914-1918 ) korzybski served as an intelligence officer in the russian army .
after being wounded in a leg and suffering other injuries , he moved to north america in *num* ( first to canada , then to the united states ) to coordinate the shipment of artillery to russia .
he also lectured to polish-american audiences about the conflict , promoting the sale of war bonds .
after the war he decided to remain in the united states , becoming a naturalized citizen in *num* .
he met mira edgerly , a painter of portraits on ivory , shortly after the1918 armistice ; they married in january *num* ; the marriage lasted until his death .
e .
p .
dutton published korzybski's first book , " manhood of humanity " , in *num* .
in this work he proposed and explained in detail a new theory of humankind : mankind as a " time-binding " class of life ( humans perform time binding by the transmission of knowledge and abstractions through time which become accreted in cultures ) .
korzybski's work culminated in the initiation of a discipline that he named general semantics ( gs ) .
this should not be confused with semantics .
the basic principles of general semantics , which include time-binding , are described in the publication " science and sanity " , published in *num* .
in *num* korzybski founded the institute of general semantics in chicago .
the post-world war ii housing shortage in chicago cost him the institute's building lease , so in *num* he moved the institute to lakeville , connecticut , u .
s .
, where he directed it until his death in *num* .
korzybski maintained that humans are limited in what they know by ( *num* ) the structure of their nervous systems , and ( *num* ) the structure of their languages .
humans cannot experience the world directly , but only through their " abstractions " ( nonverbal impressions or " gleanings " derived from the nervous system , and verbal indicators expressed and derived from language ) .
these sometimes mislead us about what is the truth .
our understanding sometimes lacks " similarity of structure " with what is actually happening .
he sought to train our awareness of abstracting , using techniques he had derived from his study of mathematics and science .
he called this awareness , this goal of his system , " consciousness of abstracting " .
his system included the promotion of attitudes such as " i don't know ; let's see , " in order that we may better discover or reflect on its realities as revealed by modern science .
another technique involved becoming inwardly and outwardly quiet , an experience he termed , " silence on the objective levels " .
many devotees and critics of korzybski reduced his rather complex system to a simple matter of what he said about the verb form " is " of the general verb " to be .
" his system , however , is based primarily on such terminology as the different " orders of abstraction , " and formulations such as " consciousness of abstracting .
" the contention that korzybski " opposed " the use of the verb " to be " would be a profound exaggeration .
he thought that " certain uses " of the verb " to be " , called the " is of identity " and the " is of predication " , were faulty in structure , e .
g .
, a statement such as , " elizabeth is a fool " ( said of a person named " elizabeth " who has done something that we regard as foolish ) .
in korzybski's system , one's assessment of elizabeth belongs to a higher order of abstraction than elizabeth herself .
korzybski's remedy was to " deny " identity ; in this example , to be aware continually that " elizabeth " is " not " what we " call " her .
we find elizabeth not in the verbal domain , the world of words , but the nonverbal domain ( the two , he said , amount to different orders of abstraction ) .
this was expressed by korzybski's most famous premise , " the map is not the territory " .
note that this premise uses the phrase " is not " , a form of " to be " ; this and many other examples show that he did not intend to abandon " to be " as such .
in fact , he said explicitly that there were no structural problems with the verb " to be " when used as an auxiliary verb or when used to state existence or location .
it was even acceptable at times to use the faulty forms of the verb " to be , " as long as one was aware of their structural limitations .
one day , korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students , and he interrupted the lesson suddenly in order to retrieve a packet of biscuits , wrapped in white paper , from his briefcase .
he muttered that he just had to eat something , and he asked the students on the seats in the front row if they would also like a biscuit .
a few students took a biscuit .
" nice biscuit , don't you think , " said korzybski , while he took a second one .
the students were chewing vigorously .
then he tore the white paper from the biscuits , in order to reveal the original packaging .
on it was a big picture of a dog's head and the words " dog cookies .
" the students looked at the package , and were shocked .
two of them wanted to vomit , put their hands in front of their mouths , and ran out of the lecture hall to the toilet .
" you see , " korzybski remarked , " i have just demonstrated that people don't just eat food , but also words , and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter .
" william burroughs went to a korzybski workshop in the autumn of *num* .
he was *num* years old , and paid $40 .
his fellow students—there were *num* in all—included young samuel i .
hayakawa ( later to become a republican member of the u .
s .
senate ) , ralph moriarty debit ( later to become the spiritual teacher vitvan ) and wendell johnson ( founder of the monster study ) .
korzybski was well received in numerous disciplines , as evidenced by the positive reactions from leading figures in the sciences and humanities in the 1940s and 1950s .
as reported in the third edition of " science and sanity " , in world war ii the us army used korzybski's system to treat battle fatigue in europe , under the supervision of dr .
douglas m .
kelley , who went on to become the psychiatrist in charge of the nazi war criminals at nuremberg .
some of the general semantics tradition was continued by samuel i .
hayakawa .
epistle to the hebrews the epistle to the hebrews , or letter to the hebrews , or in the greek manuscripts , simply to the hebrews ( πρὸς ἑβραίους ) is one of the books of the new testament .
the text is traditionally attributed to paul the apostle , but doubt on pauline authorship in the roman church is reported by eusebius .
modern biblical scholarship considers its authorship unknown , perhaps written in deliberate imitation of the style of paul .
although the writer's style reflects some characteristics of paul's writing , there are some differences .
scholars of greek consider its writing to be more polished and eloquent than any other book of the new testament , and " the very carefully composed and studied greek of hebrews is not paul's spontaneous , volatile contextual greek " .
the book has earned the reputation of being a masterpiece .
it has also been described as an intricate new testament book .
scholars believe it was written for jewish christians who lived in jerusalem .
its purpose was to exhort christians to persevere in the face of persecution .
at this time , certain believers were considering turning back to judaism ( the jewish system of law ) to escape being persecuted for accepting christ as their saviour , now following this system of grace ( saved by jesus ' sacrifice on the cross ) .
the theme of the epistle is the doctrine of the person of christ and his role as mediator between god and humanity .
the epistle opens with an exaltation of jesus as " the radiance of god's glory , the express image of his being , and upholding all things by his powerful word " .
the epistle presents jesus with the titles " pioneer " or " forerunner " , " son " and " son of god " , " priest " and " high priest " .
the epistle casts jesus as both exalted son and high priest , a unique dual christology .
hebrews uses old testament quotations interpreted in light of first century rabbinical judaism .
new testament and second temple judaism scholar eric mason argues that the conceptual background of the priestly christology of the epistle to the hebrews closely parallels presentations of the messianic priest and melchizedek in the qumran scrolls .
in both hebrews and qumran a priestly figure is discussed in the context of a davidic figure ; in both cases a divine decree appoints the priests to their eschatological duty ; both priestly figures offer an eschatological sacrifice of atonement .
although the author of hebrews was not directly influenced by qumran's " messiah of aaron " , these and other conceptions did provide " a precedent .
.
.
to conceive jesus similarly as a priest making atonement and eternal intercession in the heavenly sanctuary " .
by the end of the first century there was no consensus on the author’s identity .
clement of rome , barnabas , paul the apostle , and other names were proposed .
others later suggested luke the evangelist , apollos , or his teacher priscilla as possible authors .
in the *ord* century , origen wrote of the letter , "in the epistle entitled " to the hebrews " the diction does not exhibit the characteristic roughness of speech or phraseology admitted by the apostle [ paul ] himself , the construction of the sentences is closer to the greek usage , as anyone capable of recognising differences of style would agree .
on the other hand the matter of the epistle is wonderful , and quite equal to the apostle's acknowledged writings : the truth of this would be admitted by anyone who has read the apostle carefully .
.
.
if i were asked my personal opinion , i would say that the matter is the apostle's but the phraseology and construction are those of someone who remembered the apostle's teaching and wrote his own interpretation of what his master had said .
so if any church regards this epistle as paul's , it should be commended for so doing , for the primitive church had every justification for handing it down as his .
who wrote the epistle is known to god alone : the accounts that have reached us suggest that it was either clement , who became bishop of rome , or luke , who wrote the gospel and the acts .
" further , " men of old have handed it down as paul's , but who wrote the epistle god only knows " .
in the *ord* century , jerome and augustine of hippo supported paul's authorship : the church largely agreed to include hebrews as the fourteenth letter of paul , and affirmed this authorship until the reformation .
scholars argued that in the *ord* chapter of hebrews , timothy is referred to as a companion .
timothy was paul's missionary companion in the same way jesus sent disciples out in pairs .
also , the writer states that he wrote the letter from " italy " , which also at the time fits paul .
the difference in style is explained as simply an adjustment to a distinct audience , to the jewish christians who were being persecuted and pressured to go back to traditional judaism .
many scholars now believe that the author was one of paul's pupils or associates , citing stylistic differences between hebrews and the other pauline epistles .
recent scholarship has favored the idea that the author was probably a leader of a predominantly jewish congregation to whom he or she was writing .
because of its anonymity , it had some trouble being accepted as part of the christian canon , being classed with the antilegomena .
eventually it was accepted as scripture because of its sound theology , eloquent presentation , and other intrinsic factors .
in antiquity , certain circles began to ascribe it to paul in an attempt to provide the anonymous work an explicit apostolic pedigree .
the original king james version of the bible titled the work " the epistle of paul the apostle to the hebrews " .
however , the kjv's attribution to paul was only a guess , and is currently disputed by recent research .
its vastly different style , different theological focus , different spiritual experience , different greek vocabulary – all are believed to make paul's authorship of hebrews increasingly indefensible .
at present , neither modern scholarship nor church teaching ascribes hebrews to paul .
a .
j .
gordon ascribes the authorship of hebrews to priscilla , writing that " it is evident that the holy spirit made this woman priscilla a teacher of teachers " .
originally proposed by adolf von harnack in *num* , harnack’s reasoning won the support of prominent bible scholars of the early twentieth century .
harnack believes the letter was written in rome – not to the church , but to the inner circle .
in setting forth his evidence for priscillan authorship , he finds it amazing that the name of the author was blotted out by the earliest tradition .
citing , he says it was written by a person of " high standing and apostolic teacher of equal rank with timothy " .
if luke , clemens , barnabas , or apollos had written it , harnack believes their names would not have been obliterated .
donald guthrie’s commentary " the letter to the hebrews " ( *num* ) mentions priscilla by name as a suggested author .
believing the author to have been priscilla , ruth hoppin posits that the name was omitted either to suppress its female authorship , or to protect the letter itself from suppression .
also convinced that priscilla was the author of hebrews , gilbert bilezikian , professor of biblical studies at wheaton college , remarks on " the conspiracy of anonymity in the ancient church , " and reasons : " the lack of any firm data concerning the identity of the author in the extant writings of the church suggests a deliberate blackout more than a case of collective loss of memory .
" the use of tabernacle terminology in hebrews has been used to date the epistle before the destruction of the temple , the idea being that knowing about the destruction of both jerusalem and the temple would have influenced the development of the author's overall argument .
therefore , the most probable date for its composition is the second half of the year *num* or the beginning of *num* , according to the " catholic encyclopedia " .
however , there is no way to prove the actual dating of this writing , even from within the internal structure of the writing .
throughout the writing , all mentions of the priestly acts of worship are connected to the tabernacle in sinai , as built by moses , with no mention of the temple in jerusalem .
an argument for a later date of the hebrew text can be assumed due to the absence of any mention of the temple in jerusalem .
if the hebrew writer composed this message after the first century it would be entirely possible that the destruction of the jerusalem temple and that of the city of jerusalem would not be relevant to the writer .
thus , some academic scholars hold to a much later date of composition to the hebrew writing .
scholars have suggested that hebrews is part of an internal new testament debate between the extreme judaizers ( who argued that non-jews must convert to judaism before they can receive the holy spirit of jesus ' new covenant ) versus the extreme antinomians ( who argued that jews must reject god's commandments and that jewish law was no longer in effect ) .
james and paul represent the moderates of each faction , respectively , and peter served as moderator .
it sets before the jew the claims of christianity – to bring the jew to the full realization of the relation of judaism to christianity , to make clear that christ has fulfilled those temporary and provisional institutions , and has thus abolished them .
this view is commonly referred to as supersessionism .
those to whom hebrews is written seem to have begun to doubt whether jesus could really be the messiah for whom they were waiting , because they believed the messiah prophesied in the hebrew scriptures was to come as a militant king and destroy the enemies of his people .
jesus , however , came as a mere man who was arrested by the jewish leaders and who suffered and was crucified by the romans .
and although he was seen resurrected , he still left the earth and his people , who now face persecution rather than victory .
the book of hebrews solves this problem by arguing that the hebrew scriptures also foretold that the messiah would be a priest ( although of a different sort than the traditional levitical priests ) and jesus came to fulfill this role , as a sacrificial offering to god , to atone for sins .
his role of a king is yet to come , and so those who follow him should be patient and not be surprised that they suffer for now .
some scholars today believe the document was written to prevent apostasy .
some have interpreted apostasy to mean a number of different things , such as a group of christians in one sect leaving for another more conservative sect , one of which the author disapproves .
some have seen apostasy as a move from the christian assembly to pagan ritual .
in light of a possibly jewish-christian audience , the apostasy in this sense may be in regard to jewish-christians leaving the christian assembly to return to the jewish synagogue .
the author writes , " let us hold fast to our confession " .
the epistle has been viewed as a long , rhetorical argument for having confidence in the new way to god revealed in jesus christ .
the book could be argued to affirm special creation .
it affirms that god by his son , jesus christ , made the worlds .
" god .
.
.
hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son .
.
.
by whom also he made the worlds " .
the epistle also emphasizes the importance of faith .
" through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear " .
hebrews is a very consciously " literary " document .
the purity of its greek was noted by clement of alexandria , according to eusebius ( " historia eccl .
" , vi , xiv ) , and origen of alexandria asserted that every competent judge must recognize a great difference between this epistle and those of paul ( eusebius , vi , xxv ) .
this letter consists of two strands : an expositional or doctrinal strand , and a hortatory or strongly urging strand which punctuates the exposition parenthetically at key points as warnings to the readers .
hebrews does not fit the form of a traditional hellenistic epistle , lacking a proper prescript .
modern scholars generally believe this book was originally a sermon or homily , although possibly modified after it was delivered to include the travel plans , greetings and closing .
hebrews contains many references to the old testament – specifically to its septuagint text .
the " epistle to the hebrews " is notable for the manner in which it expresses the divine nature of christ .
as a .
c .
purdy summarized for " the interpreter's bible " ( *num* ) : we may sum up our author’s christology negatively by saying that he has nothing to do with the older hebrew messianic hopes of a coming son of david , who would be a divinely empowered human leader to bring in the kingdom of god on earth ; and that while he still employs the figure of a militant , apocalyptic king .
.
.
who will come again .
.
.
, this is not of the essence of his thought about christ .
positively , our author presents christ as divine in nature , and solves any possible objection to a divine being who participates in human experience , especially in the experience of death , by the priestly analogy .
he seems quite unconscious of the logical difficulties of his position proceeding from the that christ is both divine and human , at least human in experience although hardly in nature .
mikeal parsons has commented : if the humanity of jesus is an important theme for hebrews , how much more is jesus’ deity .
while this theme of exaltation is asserted ‘in many and various ways’ we shall content ourselves by considering how the writer addresses this theme by asserting jesus’ superiority to a ) angels , and b ) moses .
the first chapter of hebrews stresses the superiority of the son to the angels .
the very name ‘son’ indicates superiority .
this exaltation theme , in which the son is contrasted with the angels ( *num* : *num* ) , is expanded in the following string of ot quotations ( *num* : 5-13 ) .
while some have understood the catena as referring primarily to christ’s pre-existence , it is more likely that the verses should be understood , ‘as a christological hymn which traces the entire christ event , including the pre-existence , earthly life , and exaltation of christ’ .
the overall structure of the catena seems to point to exaltation as the underlying motif .
.
.
at least it may be concluded that the superiority of the son is demonstrated by this comparison / contrast with angels .
peter rhea jones has reminded us that ‘moses is not merely one of the figures compared unfavourably to jesus’ ; but rather , ‘moses and jesus are yoked throughout the entirety of the epistle’ .
allowing that moses is much more than a ‘whipping boy’ for the author , the fact remains that the figure moses is utilized as a basis for christology .
while there are several references to moses , only two will be needed to demonstrate jesus’ superiority .
the first passage to be considered is hebrews *num* : 1-6 .
d’angelo and others regard the larger context of this passage ( *num* : 1-4 : *num* ) to be the superiority of christ’s message to the law .
while the comparison between jesus and the angels is based on a number of ot citations , the comparison of jesus and moses turns on a single verse , nu .
*num* : *num* .
like the angels ( *num* : *num* ) , moses was a servant who witnessed , as it were , to the son .
in other words , ‘faithful sonship is superior to faithful servantship’ .
the son is once again exalted .
the exaltation theme finds expression in a more opaque way at *num* : *num* .
here in the famous chapter on faith moses is said to count ‘abuse suffered for the christ greater wealth than the treasures of egypt’ .
the portrait of moses drawn here is that of a martyr , and a christian martyr at that .
in effect , moses joins that great cloud of witnesses who looked to jesus as pioneer and perfecter of faith .
once again , christ’s superiority is asserted , this time over moses and the entire mosaic epoch .
in summary , the writer [ of hebrews ] stressed the sonship of jesus and expressed it in a three-stage christology of pre-existence , humanity , and exaltation .
aachen aachen ( , ; ) , also known as bad aachen ( " aachen spa " ) , and in french and traditional english as aix-la-chapelle , is a spa and border city in north rhine-westphalia , germany .
aachen developed from a roman settlement and spa , subsequently becoming the preferred medieval imperial residence of charlemagne , and , from *num* to *num* , the place where *num* holy roman emperors were crowned kings of the germans .
aachen is the westernmost city in germany , located near the borders with belgium and the netherlands , west south west of cologne in a former coal-mining area .
one of germany's leading institutes of higher education in technology , the rwth aachen university is located in the city .
aachen's industries include science , engineering and information technology .
in *num* , aachen was ranked eighth among cities in germany for innovation .
the name " aachen " is a modern descendant , like southern german , , meaning " river " or " stream " , from old high german , meaning " water " or " stream " , which directly translates ( and etymologically corresponds to ) latin , referring to the springs .
the location has been inhabited by humans since the neolithic era , about *num* , *num* years ago , attracted to its warm mineral springs .
latin figures in aachen's roman name , which meant " waters of grannus " , referring to the celtic god of healing who was worshipped at the springs .
this word became in walloon and in french , and subsequently after charlemagne had his palatine chapel built there in the late *ord* century and then made the city his empire's capital .
aachen's name in french and german evolved in parallel .
the city is known by a variety of different names in other languages : aachen is at the western end of the benrath line that divides high german to the south from the rest of the west germanic speech area to the north .
aachen's local dialect is called and belongs to the ripuarian language .
flint quarries on the lousberg , schneeberg , and königshügel , first used during neolithic times ( 3000–2500 bc ) , attest to the long occupation of the site of aachen , as do recent finds under the modern city's " elisengarten " pointing to a former settlement from the same period .
bronze age ( around *num* bc ) settlement is evidenced by the remains of barrows ( burial mounds ) found , for example , on the klausberg .
during the iron age , the area was settled by celtic peoples who were perhaps drawn by the marshy aachen basin's hot sulphur springs where they worshipped grannus , god of light and healing .
later , the 25-hectare roman spa resort town of aquae granni was , according to legend , founded by grenus , under hadrian , around *num* ad .
instead , the fictitious founder refers to the celtic god , and it seems it was the roman *ord* legion at the start of the *ord* century ad that first channelled the hot springs into a spa at büchel , adding at the end of the same century the " münstertherme " spa , two water pipelines , and a probable sanctuary dedicated to grannus .
a kind of forum , surrounded by colonnades , connected the two spa complexes .
there was also an extensive residential area , part of it inhabited by a flourishing jewish community .
the romans built bathhouses near burtscheid .
a temple precinct called " vernenum " was built near the modern kornelimünster / walheim .
today , remains have been found of three bathhouses , including two fountains in the " elisenbrunnen " and the burtscheid bathhouse .
roman civil administration in aachen broke down between the end of the *ord* and beginning of the *ord* centuries .
rome withdrew its troops from the area , but the town remained populated .
by *num* , the town came to be ruled by the ripuarian franks and subordinated to their capital , cologne .
after roman times , pepin the short had a castle residence built in the town , due to the proximity of the hot springs and also for strategic reasons as it is located between the rhineland and northern france .
einhard mentions that in 765–6 pepin spent both christmas and easter at " aquis villa " ( " " ) , ( " and [ he ] celebrated christmas in the town aquis , and similarly easter " ) which must have been sufficiently equipped to support the royal household for several months .
in the year of his coronation as king of the franks , *num* , charlemagne came to spend christmas at aachen for the first time .
he remained there in a mansion which he may have extended , although there is no source attesting to any significant building activity at aachen in his time , apart from the building of the palatine chapel ( since *num* , cathedral ) and the palace .
charlemagne spent most winters in aachen between *num* and his death in *num* .
aachen became the focus of his court and the political centre of his empire .
after his death , the king was buried in the church which he had built ; his original tomb has been lost , while his alleged remains are preserved in the " karlsschrein " , the shrine where he was reburied after being declared a saint ; his saintliness , however , was never officially acknowledged by the roman curia as such .
in *num* , otto i was crowned king of east francia in the collegiate church built by charlemagne .
during the reign of otto ii , the nobles revolted and the west franks , under lothair , raided aachen in the ensuing confusion .
aachen was attacked again by odo of champagne , who attacked the imperial palace while conrad ii was absent .
odo relinquished it quickly and was killed soon afterwards .
the palace and town of aachen had fortifying walls built by order of emperor frederick barbarossa between *num* and *num* .
over the next *num* years , most kings of germany destined to reign over the holy roman empire were crowned in aachen .
the original audience hall built by charlemagne was torn down and replaced by the current city hall in *num* .
the last king to be crowned here was ferdinand i in *num* .
during the middle ages , aachen remained a city of regional importance , due to its proximity to flanders ; it achieved a modest position in the trade in woollen cloths , favoured by imperial privilege .
the city remained a free imperial city , subject to the emperor only , but was politically far too weak to influence the policies of any of its neighbours .
the only dominion it had was over burtscheid , a neighbouring territory ruled by a benedictine abbess .
it was forced to accept that all of its traffic must pass through the " aachener reich " .
even in the late *ord* century the abbess of burtscheid was prevented from building a road linking her territory to the neighbouring estates of the duke of jülich ; the city of aachen even deployed its handful of soldiers to chase away the road-diggers .
as an imperial city , aachen held certain political privileges that allowed it to remain independent of the troubles of europe for many years .
it remained a direct vassal of the holy roman empire throughout most of the middle ages .
it was also the site of many important church councils , including the council of *num* and the council of *num* , a council convened by the antipope paschal iii .
aachen has proved an important site for the production of historical manuscripts .
under charlemagne's purview , both the ada gospels and the coronation gospels may have been produced in aachen .
in addition , quantities of the other texts in the court library were also produced locally .
during the reign of louis the pious ( 814–840 ) , substantial quantities of ancient texts were produced at aachen , including legal manuscripts such as the leges scriptorium group , patristic texts including the five manuscripts of the bamberg pliny group .
finally , under lothair i ( 840–855 ) , texts of outstanding quality were still being produced .
this however marked the end of the period of manuscript production at aachen .
in *num* , following the invasion of spanish troops from the netherlands , rudolf deposed all protestant office holders in aachen and even went as far as expelling them from the city .
from the early *ord* century , aachen started to lose its power and influence .
first the coronations of emperors were moved from aachen to frankfurt .
this was followed by the religious wars , and the great fire of *num* .
after the destruction of most of the city in *num* , the rebuilding was mostly in the baroque style .
the decline of aachen culminated in *num* , when the french , led by general charles dumouriez , occupied aachen .
by the middle of the *ord* century aachen had become attractive as a spa : not so much because of the effects of the hot springs on the health of its visitors but because aachen was then – and remained well into the *ord* century – a place of high-level prostitution .
traces of this hidden agenda of the city's history are found in the 18th-century guidebooks to aachen as well as to the other spas .
the main indication for visiting patients , ironically , was syphilis ; only by the end of the *ord* century had rheumatism become the most important object of cures at aachen and burtscheid .
aachen was chosen as the site of several important congresses and peace treaties : the first congress of aachen ( often referred to as the congress of aix-la-chapelle in english ) on *num* may *num* , leading to the first treaty of aachen in the same year which ended the war of devolution .
the second congress ended with the second treaty in *num* , ending the war of the austrian succession .
in *num* , there was a constitutional crisis in the aachen government , and in *num* aachen lost its status as a free imperial city .
on *num* february *num* , the peace of lunéville removed the ownership of aachen and the entire " left bank " of the rhine from germany and granted it to france .
in *num* , control of the town was passed to prussia , by an act passed by the congress of vienna .
the third congress took place in *num* , to decide the fate of occupied napoleonic france .
by the middle of the *ord* century , industrialisation had swept away most of the city's medieval rules of production and commerce , although the entirely corrupt remains of the city's medieval constitution were kept in place ( compare the famous remarks of georg forster in his " ansichten vom niederrhein " ) until *num* , when aachen became the " chef-lieu du département de la roer " in napoleon's first french empire .
in *num* , after the napoleonic wars , the kingdom of prussia took over .
the city was one of its most socially and politically backward centres until the end of the *ord* century .
administered within the rhine province , by *num* the population was *num* , *num* .
starting in *num* , the railway from cologne to belgium passed through aachen .
the city suffered extreme overcrowding and deplorable sanitary conditions until *num* , when the medieval fortifications were finally abandoned as a limit to building and new , better housing was built in the east of the city , where sanitary drainage was easiest .
in december *num* , the aachen tramway network was opened , and in *num* it was electrified .
in the *ord* century and up to the 1930s , the city was important in the production of railway locomotives and carriages , iron , pins , needles , buttons , tobacco , woollen goods , and silk goods .
after world war i , aachen was occupied by the allies until *num* , along with the rest of german territory west of the rhine .
aachen was one of the locations involved in the ill-fated rhenish republic .
on *num* october *num* , an armed band took over the city hall .
similar actions took place in mönchen-gladbach , duisburg , and krefeld .
this republic lasted only about a year .
aachen was heavily damaged during world war ii .
the city and its fortified surroundings were laid siege to from *num* september to *num* october *num* by the us *ord* infantry division with the *ord* armored division assisting from the south .
around *num* october the us *ord* armored division played their part , coming from the north and getting as close as würselen , while the *ord* infantry division played a crucial role in completing the encirclement of aachen on *num* october *num* .
with reinforcements from the us *ord* infantry division the battle of aachen then continued involving direct assaults through the heavily defended city , which finally forced the german garrison to surrender on *num* october *num* .
aachen was the first german city to be captured by the allies , and its residents welcomed the soldiers as liberators .
the city was destroyed partially – and in some parts completely – during the fighting , mostly by american artillery fire and demolitions carried out by the waffen-ss defenders .
damaged buildings included the medieval churches of st .
foillan , st .
paul and st .
nicholas , and the rathaus ( city hall ) , although aachen cathedral was largely unscathed .

the city of aachen has developed into a technology hub as a by-product of hosting one of the leading universities of technology in germany with the rwth aachen ( rheinisch-westfälische technische hochschule ) , known especially for mechanical engineering , automotive and manufacturing technology as well as for its research and academic hospital klinikum aachen , one of the largest medical facilities in europe .
aachen is located in the middle of the meuse–rhine euroregion , close to the border tripoint of germany , the netherlands , and belgium .
the town of vaals in the netherlands lies nearby at about from aachen's city centre , while the dutch city of heerlen and eupen , the capital of the german-speaking community of belgium , are both located about from aachen city centre .
aachen lies near the head of the open valley of the wurm ( which today flows through the city in canalised form ) , part of the larger basin of the meuse , and about north of the high fens , which form the northern edge of the eifel uplands of the rhenish massif .
the maximum dimensions of the city's territory are from north to south , and from east to west .
the city limits are long , of which border belgium and the netherlands .
the highest point in aachen , located in the far southeast of the city , lies at an elevation of *num* m above sea level .
the lowest point , in the north , and on the border with the netherlands , is at *num* m .
as the westernmost city in germany ( and close to the low countries ) , aachen and the surrounding area belongs to a temperate climate zone , with humid weather , mild winters , and warm summers .
because of its location north of the eifel and the high fens and its subsequent prevailing westerly weather patterns , rainfall in aachen ( on average *num* mm / year ) is comparatively higher than , for example , in bonn ( with *num* mm / year ) .
another factor in the local weather forces of aachen is the occurrence of foehn winds on the southerly air currents , which results from the city's geographic location on the northern edge of the eifel .
because the city is surrounded by hills , it suffers from inversion-related smog .
some areas of the city have become urban heat islands as a result of poor heat exchange , both because of the area's natural geography and from human activity .
the city's numerous cold air corridors , which are slated to remain as free as possible from new construction , therefore play an important role in the urban climate of aachen .
the january average is , while the july average is .
precipitation is almost evenly spread throughout the year .
the geology of aachen is very structurally heterogeneous .
the oldest occurring rocks in the area surrounding the city originate from the devonian period and include carboniferous sandstone , greywacke , claystone and limestone .
these formations are part of the rhenish massif , north of the high fens .
in the pennsylvanian subperiod of the carboniferous geological period , these rock layers were narrowed and folded as a result of the variscan orogeny .
after this event , and over the course of the following *num* million years , this area has been continuously flattened .
during the cretaceous period , the ocean penetrated the continent from the direction of the north sea up to the mountainous area near aachen , bringing with it clay , sand , and chalk deposits .
while the clay ( which was the basis for a major pottery industry in nearby raeren ) is mostly found in the lower areas of aachen , the hills of the aachen forest and the lousberg were formed from upper cretaceous sand and chalk deposits .
more recent sedimentation is mainly located in the north and east of aachen and was formed through tertiary and quaternary river and wind activities .
along the major thrust fault of the variscan orogeny , there are over *num* thermal springs in aachen and burtscheid .
additionally , the subsurface of aachen is traversed by numerous active faults that belong to the rurgraben fault system , which has been responsible for numerous earthquakes in the past , including the *num* düren earthquake and the *num* roermond earthquake , which was the strongest earthquake ever recorded in the netherlands .
aachen has *num* , *num* inhabitants ( as of *num* december *num* ) , of whom *num* , *num* are female , and *num* , *num* are male .
the unemployment rate in the city is , as of april *num* , *num* .
*num* percent .
at the end of *num* , the foreign-born residents of aachen made up *num* .
*num* percent of the total population .
a significant portion of foreign residents are students at the rwth aachen university .
the city is divided into seven administrative districts , or boroughs , each with its own district council , district leader , and district authority .
the councils are elected locally by those who live within the district , and these districts are further subdivided into smaller sections for statistical purposes , with each sub-district named by a two-digit number .
the districts of aachen , including their constituent statistical districts , are : regardless of official statistical designations , there are *num* neighbourhoods and communities within aachen , here arranged by district : the following cities and communities border aachen , clockwise from the northwest : herzogenrath , würselen , eschweiler , stolberg and roetgen ( which are all in the district of aachen ) ; raeren , kelmis and plombières ( lüttich province in belgium ) as well as vaals , gulpen-wittem , simpelveld , heerlen and kerkrade ( all in limburg province in the netherlands ) .
aachen cathedral was erected on the orders of charlemagne .
construction began " c .
" ad *num* and it was , on completion " c .
" *num* , the largest cathedral north of the alps .
it was modelled after the basilica of san vitale , in ravenna , italy , and was built by odo of metz .
charlemagne also desired for the chapel to compete with the lateran palace , both in quality and authority .
it was originally built in the carolingian style , including marble covered walls , and mosaic inlay on the dome .
on his death , charlemagne's remains were interred in the cathedral and can be seen there to this day .
the cathedral was extended several times in later ages , turning it into a curious and unique mixture of building styles .
the throne and gallery portion date from the ottonian , with portions of the original opus sectile floor still visible .
the *ord* century saw gables being added to the roof , and after the fire of *num* , the dome was rebuilt .
finally , a choir was added around the start of the *ord* century .
after frederick barbarossa canonised charlemagne in *num* the chapel became a destination for pilgrims .
for *num* years , from *num* to *num* , aachen cathedral was the church of coronation for *num* german kings and *num* queens .
the church built by charlemagne is still the main attraction of the city .
in addition to holding the remains of its founder , it became the burial place of his successor otto iii .
in the upper chamber of the gallery , charlemagne's marble throne is housed .
aachen cathedral has been designated as a unesco world heritage site .
most of the marble and columns used in the construction of the cathedral were brought from rome and ravenna , including the sarcophagus that charlemagne was eventually laid to rest in .
a bronze bear from gaul was placed inside , along with an equestrian statue from ravenna , believed to be theodric .
these were in contrast to a wolf and a statue of marcus aurelius in the capitoline .
bronze pieces such as the doors and railings were cast in a local foundry , some of which have survived to the present .
finally , there is uncertainty surrounding the bronze pine cone in the chapel , and where it was created .
wherever it was made , it was also a parallel to a piece in rome , this in old st .
peter's basilica .
aachen cathedral treasury has housed , throughout its history , a collection of liturgical objects .
the origin of this church treasure is in dispute as some say charlemagne himself endowed his chapel with the original collection , while the rest were collected over time .
others say all of the objects were collected over time , from such places as jerusalem and constantinople .
the location of this treasury has moved over time and was unknown until the *ord* century when it was located in the matthiaskapelle ( st .
matthew's chapel ) until *num* , when it was moved to the karlskapelle ( charles ' chapel ) .
from there it was moved to the hungarian chapel in *num* and in *num* to its present location next to the allerseelenkapelle ( poor souls ' chapel ) .
only six of the original carolingian objects have remained , and of those only three are left in aachen : the aachen gospels , a diptych of christ , and an early byzantine silk .
the coronation gospels and a reliquary burse of st .
stephen were moved to vienna in *num* and the talisman of charlemagne was given as a gift in *num* to josephine bonaparte and subsequently to rheims cathedral .
*num* documented pieces have been added to the treasury since its inception , typically to receive in return legitimisation of linkage to the heritage of charlemagne .
the lothar cross , the gospels of otto iii and multiple additional byzantine silks were donated by otto iii .
part of the pala d'oro and a covering for the aachen gospels were made of gold donated by henry ii .
frederick barbarossa donated the candelabrum that adorns the dome and also once " crowned " the shrine of charlemagne , which was placed underneath in *num* .
charles iv donated a pair of reliquaries .
louis xi gave , in *num* , the crown of margaret of york , and , in *num* , another arm reliquary of charlemagne .
maximilian i and charles v both gave numerous works of art by hans von reutlingen .
continuing the tradition , objects continued to be donated until the present , each indicative of the period of its gifting , with the last documented gift being a chalice from *num* made by ewald mataré .
the aachen rathaus , ( english : aachen city hall or aachen town hall ) dated from *num* , lies between two central squares , the " markt " ( marketplace ) and the " katschhof " ( between city hall and cathedral ) .
the coronation hall is on the first floor of the building .
inside one can find five frescoes by the aachen artist alfred rethel which show legendary scenes from the life of charlemagne , as well as charlemagne's signature .
also , precious replicas of the imperial regalia are kept here .
since *num* , the city hall has been a station on the " route charlemagne " , a tour programme by which historical sights of aachen are presented to visitors .
at the city hall , a museum exhibition explains the history and art of the building and gives a sense of the historical coronation banquets that took place there .
a portrait of napoleon from *num* by louis-andré-gabriel bouchet and one of his wife joséphine from *num* by robert lefèvre are viewable as part of the tour .
as before , the city hall is the seat of the mayor of aachen and of the city council , and annually the charlemagne prize is awarded there .
the " grashaus " , a late medieval house at the " fischmarkt " , is one of the oldest non-religious buildings in central aachen .
it hosted the city archive , and before that , the grashaus was the city hall until the present building took over this function .
the " elisenbrunnen " is one of the most famous sights of aachen .
it is a neo-classical hall covering one of the city's famous fountains .
it is just a minute away from the cathedral .
just a few steps in a south-easterly direction lies the 19th-century theatre .
also of note are two remaining city gates , the " ponttor " ( pont gate ) , half a mile northwest of the cathedral , and the " marschiertor " ( marching gate ) , close to the central railway station .
there are also a few parts of both medieval city walls left , most of them integrated into more recent buildings , but some others still visible .
there are even five towers left , some of which are used for housing .
st .
michael's church , aachen was built as a church of the aachen jesuit collegium in *num* .

funeral a funeral is a ceremony connected with the burial , cremation , or interment of a corpse , or the burial ( or equivalent ) with the attendant observances .
funerary customs comprise the complex of beliefs and practices used by a culture to remember and respect the dead , from interment , to various monuments , prayers , and rituals undertaken in their honor .
customs vary between cultures and religious groups .
common secular motivations for funerals include mourning the deceased , celebrating their life , and offering support and sympathy to the bereaved ; additionally , funerals may have religious aspects that are intended to help the soul of the deceased reach the afterlife , resurrection or reincarnation .
the funeral usually includes a ritual through which the corpse receives a final dispositon .
depending on culture and religion , these can involve either the destruction of the body ( for example , by cremation or sky burial ) or its preservation ( for example , by mummification or interment ) .
differing beliefs about cleanliness and the relationship between body and soul are reflected in funerary practices .
a memorial service or celebration of life is a funerary ceremony that is performed without the remains of the deceased person .
the word " funeral " comes from the latin " funus " , which had a variety of meanings , including the corpse and the funerary rites themselves .
funerary art is art produced in connection with burials , including many kinds of tombs , and objects specially made for burial like flowers with a corpse .
funeral rites are as old as human culture itself , pre-dating modern " homo sapiens " and dated to at least *num* , *num* years ago .
for example , in the shanidar cave in iraq , in pontnewydd cave in wales and at other sites across europe and the near east , archaeologists have discovered neanderthal skeletons with a characteristic layer of flower pollen .
this deliberate burial and reverence given to the dead has been interpreted as suggesting that neanderthals had religious beliefs , although the evidence is not unequivocal – while the dead were apparently buried deliberately , burrowing rodents could have introduced the flowers .
substantial cross-cultural and historical research document funeral customs as a highly predictable , stable force in communities .
funeral customs tend to be characterized by five " anchors " : significant symbols , gathered community , ritual action , cultural heritage , and transition of the dead body ( corpse ) .
funerals in the bahá'í faith are characterized by not embalming , a prohibition against cremation , using a chrysolite or hardwood casket , wrapping the body in silk or cotton , burial not farther than an hour ( including flights ) from the place of death , and placing a ring on the deceased's finger stating , " i came forth from god , and return unto him , detached from all save him , holding fast to his name , the merciful , the compassionate .
" the bahá'í funeral service also contains the only prayer that's permitted to be read as a group - congregational prayer , although most of the prayer is read by one person in the gathering .
the bahá'í decedent often controls some aspects of the bahá'í funeral service , since leaving a will and testament is a requirement for bahá'ís .
since there is no bahá'í clergy , services are usually conducted under the guise , or with the assistance of , a local spiritual assembly .
a buddhist funeral marks the transition from one life to the next for the deceased .
it also reminds the living of their own mortality .
christian burials typically occur on consecrated ground .
burial , rather than a destructive process such as cremation , was the traditional practice amongst christians , because of the belief in the resurrection of the body .
cremations later came into widespread use , although some denominations forbid them .
the us conference of catholic bishops said " the church earnestly recommends that the pious custom of burying the bodies of the deceased be observed ; nevertheless , the church does not prohibit cremation unless it was chosen for reasons contrary to christian doctrine " ( canon *num* .
*num* ) .
congregations of varied denominations perform different ceremonies , but most involve offering prayers , scripture reading from the bible , a sermon , homily , or eulogy , and music .
one issue of concern as the *ord* century began was with the use of secular music at christian funerals , a custom generally forbidden by the roman catholic church .
antyesti , literally " last rites or last sacrifice " , refers to the rite-of-passage rituals associated with a funeral in hinduism .
it is sometimes referred to as " antima samskaram " , " antya-kriya " , " anvarohanyya " , or " vahni sanskara " .
a dead adult hindu is cremated , while a dead child is typically buried .
the rite of passage is said to be performed in harmony with the sacred premise that the microcosm of all living beings is a reflection of a macrocosm of the universe .
the soul ( atman , brahman ) is believed to be the immortal essence that is released at the " antyeshti " ritual , but both the body and the universe are vehicles and transitory in various schools of hinduism .
they consist of five elements : air , water , fire , earth and space .
the last rite of passage returns the body to the five elements and origins .
the roots of this belief are found in the vedas , for example in the hymns of rigveda in section *num* .
*num* , as follows , the final rites of a burial , in case of untimely death of a child , is rooted in rig veda's section *num* .
*num* , where the hymns mourn the death of the child , praying to deity mrityu to " neither harm our girls nor our boys " , and pleads the earth to cover , protect the deceased child as a soft wool .
among hindus , the dead body is usually cremated within a day of death .
the body is washed , wrapped in white cloth for a man or a widow , red for a married woman , the two toes tied together with a string , a " tilak " ( red mark ) placed on the forehead .
the dead adult's body is carried to the cremation ground near a river or water , by family and friends , and placed on a pyre with feet facing south .
the eldest son , or a male mourner , or a priest then bathes before leading the cremation ceremonial function .
he circumambulates the dry wood pyre with the body , says a eulogy or recites a hymn in some cases , places sesame seed in the dead person's mouth , sprinkles the body and the pyre with ghee ( clarified butter ) , then draws three lines signifying " yama " ( deity of the dead ) , " kala " ( time , deity of cremation ) and the dead .
the pyre is then set ablaze , while the mourners mourn .
the ash from the cremation is consecrated to the nearest river or sea .
after the cremation , a period of mourning is observed for *num* to *num* days after which the immediate male relatives or the sons of the deceased shave their head , trim their nails , recites prayers with the help of priest or brahmin and invite all relatives , kins , friends and neighbours to eat a simple meal together in remembrance of the deceased .
this day , in some communities , also marks a day when the poor and needy are offered food in memory of the dead .
funerals in islam ( called janazah in arabic ) follow fairly specific rites .
in all cases , however , sharia ( islamic religious law ) calls for burial of the body , preceded by a simple ritual involving bathing and shrouding the body , followed by salat ( prayer ) .
burial rituals should normally take place as soon as possible and include : the mourning period is *num* days long .
in judaism , funerals follow fairly specific rites , though they are subject to variation in custom .
funerals in judaism share many features with those of islam .
jewish religious law ( " halakha ) " calls for preparatory rituals involving bathing and shrouding the body accompanied by prayers and readings from the hebrew bible , and then a funeral service marked by eulogies and brief prayers , and then the lowering of the body into the grave and the filling of the grave .
traditional law and practice forbid cremation of the body ; the reform jewish movement generally discourages cremation but does not outright forbid it .
burial rites should normally take place as soon as possible and include : in sikhism death is not considered a natural process , an event that has absolute certainty and only happens as a direct result of god's will or hukam .
to a sikh , birth and death are closely associated , because they are both part of the cycle of human life of " coming and going " ( ਆਵਣੁ ਜਾਣਾ , aana jaana ) which is seen as transient stage towards liberation ( ਮੋਖੁ ਦੁਆਰੁ , mokh du-aar ) , complete unity with god ; sikhs believe in reincarnation .
the soul itself is not subject to the cycle of birth and death ; death is only the progression of the soul on its journey from god , through the created universe and back to god again .
in life a sikh is expected to constantly remember death so that he or she may be sufficiently prayerful , detached and righteous to break the cycle of birth and death and return to god .
the public display of grief by wailing or crying out loud at the funeral ( called antam sanskar in the sikh culture ) is discouraged and should be kept to a minimum .
cremation is the preferred method of disposal , although if this is not possible other methods such as burial , or burial at sea , are acceptable .
markers such as gravestones , monuments , etc .
are discouraged , because the body is considered to be only the shell and the person's soul is their real essence .
on the day of the cremation , the body is washed and dressed and then taken to the gurdwara or home where hymns ( shabads ) from sri guru granth sahib ji , the sikh scriptures are recited by the congregation .
kirtan may also be performed by ragis while the relatives of the deceased recite " waheguru " sitting near the coffin .
this service normally takes from *num* to *num* minutes .
at the conclusion of the service , an ardas is said before the coffin is taken to the cremation site .
at the point of cremation , a few more shabads may be sung and final speeches are made about the deceased person .
the eldest son or a close relative generally lights the fire .
this service usually lasts about *num* to *num* minutes .
the ashes are later collected and disposed of by immersing them in the punjab ( five famous rivers in india ) .
the sidaran paath the ceremony in which the sidharan paath is begun after the cremation ceremony , may be held when convenient , wherever the guru granth sahib is present : hymns are sung from sri guru granth sahib ji .
the first five and final verses of " anand sahib , " the " song of bliss , " are recited or sung .
the first five verses of sikhism's morning prayer , " japji sahib , " are read aloud to begin the sidharan paath .
a hukam , or random verse , is read from sri guru granth sahib ji .
ardas , a prayer , is offered .
prashad , a sacred sweet , is distributed .
langar , a meal , is served to guests .
while the sidharan paath is being read , the family may also sing hymns daily .
reading may take as long as needed to complete the paath .
this ceremony is followed by sahaj paath bhog , kirtan sohila , night time prayer is recited *num* week and finally ardas called the " antim ardas " ( " final prayer " ) is offered the last week .
the greek word for funeral – " kēdeía " ( κηδεία ) – derives from the verb " kēdomai " ( κήδομαι ) , that means attend to , take care of someone .
derivative words are also " kēdemón " ( κηδεμών , " guardian " ) and " kēdemonía " ( κηδεμονία , " guardianship " ) .
from the cycladic civilization in 3000bc until the hypo-mycenaean era in 1200–1100 bc the main practice of burial is interment .
the cremation of the dead that appears around the *ord* century bc constitutes a new practice of burial and is probably an influence from the east .
until the christian era , when interment becomes again the only burial practice , both cremation and interment had been practiced depending on the area .
the ancient greek funeral since the homeric era included the " próthesis " ( πρόθεσις ) , the " ekphorá " ( ἐκφορά ) , the burial and the " perídeipnon " ( περίδειπνον ) .
in most cases , this process is followed faithfully in greece until today .
"próthesis " is the deposition of the body of the deceased on the funereal bed and the threnody of his relatives .
today the body is placed in the casket , that is always open in greek funerals .
this part takes place in the house where the deceased had lived .
an important part of the greek tradition is the " epicedium " , the mournful songs that are sung by the family of the deceased along with professional mourners ( who are extinct in the modern era ) .
the deceased was watched over by his beloved the entire night before the burial , an obligatory ritual in popular thought , which is maintained still .
"ekphorá " is the process of transport of the mortal remains of the deceased from his residence to the church , nowadays , and afterward to the place of burial .
the procession in the ancient times , according to the law , should have passed silently through the streets of the city .
usually certain favourite objects of the deceased were placed in the coffin in order to " go along with him .
" in certain regions , coins to pay charon , who ferries the dead to the underworld , are also placed inside the casket .
a last kiss is given to the beloved dead by the family before the coffin is closed .
the roman orator cicero describes the habit of planting flowers around the tomb as an effort to guarantee the repose of the deceased and the purification of the ground , a custom that is maintained until today .
after the ceremony , the mourners return to the house of the deceased for the " perídeipnon " , the dinner after the burial .
according to archaeological findings–traces of ash , bones of animals , shards of crockery , dishes and basins–the dinner during the classical era was also organized at the burial spot .
taking into consideration the written sources , however , the dinner could also be served in the houses .
two days after the burial , a ceremony called " the thirds " was held .
eight days after the burial the relatives and the friends of the deceased assembled at the burial spot , where " the ninths " would take place , a custom still kept .
in addition to this , in the modern era , memorial services take place *num* days , *num* months , *num* months , *num* months , *num* year after the death and from then on every year on the anniversary of the death .
the relatives of the deceased , for an unspecified length of time that depends on them , are in mourning , during which women wear black clothes and men a black armband .
in ancient rome , the eldest surviving male of the household , the " pater familias " , was summoned to the death-bed , where he attempted to catch and inhale the last breath of the decedent .
funerals of the socially prominent usually were undertaken by professional undertakers called " libitinarii " .
no direct description has been passed down of roman funeral rites .
these rites usually included a public procession to the tomb or pyre where the body was to be cremated .
the surviving relations bore masks bearing the images of the family's deceased ancestors .
the right to carry the masks in public eventually was restricted to families prominent enough to have held " curule magistracies " .
mimes , dancers , and musicians hired by the undertakers , and professional female mourners , took part in these processions .
less well-to-do romans could join benevolent funerary societies ( " collegia funeraticia " ) that undertook these rites on their behalf .
nine days after the disposal of the body , by burial or cremation , a feast was given ( " cena novendialis " ) and a libation poured over the grave or the ashes .
since most romans were cremated , the ashes typically were collected in an urn and placed in a niche in a collective tomb called a " columbarium " ( literally , " dovecote " ) .
during this nine-day period , the house was considered to be tainted , " funesta " , and was hung with taxus baccata or mediterranean cypress branches to warn passersby .
at the end of the period , the house was swept out to symbolically purge it of the taint of death .
several roman holidays commemorated a family's dead ancestors , including the " parentalia " , held february *num* through *num* , to honor the family's ancestors ; and the feast of the lemures , held on may *num* , *num* , and *num* , in which ghosts ( " larvae " ) were feared to be active , and the " pater familias " sought to appease them with offerings of beans .
the romans prohibited cremation or inhumation within the sacred boundary of the city " ( pomerium ) " , for both religious and civil reasons , so that the priests might not be contaminated by touching a dead body , and that houses would not be endangered by funeral fires .
restrictions on the length , ostentation , expense of , and behaviour during funerals and mourning gradually were enacted by a variety of lawmakers .
often the pomp and length of rites could be politically or socially motivated to advertise or aggrandise a particular kin group in roman society .
this was seen as deleterious to society and conditions for grieving were set .
for instance , under some laws , women were prohibited from loud wailing or lacerating their faces and limits were introduced for expenditure on tombs and burial clothes .
the romans commonly built tombs for themselves during their lifetime .
hence these words frequently occur in ancient inscriptions , v .
f .
vivus facit , v .
s .
p .
the tombs of the rich usually were constructed of marble , the ground enclosed with walls , and planted around with trees .
but common sepulchres usually were built below ground , and called hypogea .
there were niches cut out of the walls , in which the urns were placed ; these , from their resemblance to the niche of a pigeon-house , were called columbaria .
within the united states and canada , in most cultural groups and regions , the funeral rituals can be divided into three parts : visitation , funeral , and the burial service .
at the " visitation " ( also called a " viewing " , " wake " or " calling hours " ) , in christian or secular western custom , the body of the deceased person ( or decedent ) is placed on display in the casket ( also called a coffin , however almost all body containers are caskets ) .
the viewing often takes place on one or two evenings before the funeral .
in the past , it was common practice to place the casket in the decedent’s home or that of a relative for viewing .
this practice continues in many areas of ireland and scotland .
the body is traditionally dressed in the decedent's best clothes .
in recent times there has been more variation in what the decedent is dressed in – some people choose to be dressed in clothing more reflective of how they dressed in life .
the body will often be adorned with common jewelry , such as watches , necklaces , brooches , etc .
the jewelry may be taken off and given to the family of the deceased prior to burial or be buried with the deceased .
jewelry has to be removed before cremation in order to prevent damage to the crematory .
the body may or may not be embalmed , depending upon such factors as the amount of time since the death has occurred , religious practices , or requirements of the place of burial .
the most commonly prescribed aspects of this gathering are that the attendees sign a book kept by the deceased's survivors to record who attended .
in addition , a family may choose to display photographs taken of the deceased person during his / her life ( often , formal portraits with other family members and candid pictures to show " happy times " ) , prized possessions and other items representing his / her hobbies and / or accomplishments .
a more recent trend is to create a dvd with pictures and video of the deceased , accompanied by music , and play this dvd continuously during the visitation .
the viewing is either " open casket " , in which the embalmed body of the deceased has been clothed and treated with cosmetics for display ; or " closed casket " , in which the coffin is closed .
the coffin may be closed if the body was too badly damaged because of an accident or fire or other trauma , deformed from illness , if someone in the group is emotionally unable to cope with viewing the corpse , or if the deceased did not wish to be viewed .
in cases such as these , a picture of the deceased , usually a formal photo , is placed atop the casket .
however , this step is foreign to judaism ; jewish funerals are held soon after death ( preferably within a day or two , unless more time is needed for relatives to come ) , and the corpse is never displayed .
torah law forbids embalming .
traditionally flowers ( and music ) are not sent to a grieving jewish family as it is a reminder of the life that is now lost .
the jewish shiva tradition discourages family members from cooking , so food is brought by friends and neighbors .
( " see also jewish bereavement .
" ) the decedent's closest friends and relatives who are unable to attend frequently send flowers to the viewing , with the exception of a jewish funeral , where flowers would not be appropriate ( donations are often given to a charity instead ) .
obituaries sometimes contain a request that attendees do not send flowers ( e .
g .
" in lieu of flowers " ) .
the use of these phrases has been on the rise for the past century .
in the us in *num* , only *num* % of the obituaries included the directive , with only *num* .
*num* % of those mentioned charitable contributions instead .
by the middle of the century , they had grown to *num* .
*num* % , with over *num* % of those noting a charitable contribution as the preferred method of expressing sympathy .
today , well over *num* % of them have such a note – but those statistics vary demographically .
the viewing typically takes place at a funeral home , which is equipped with gathering rooms where the viewing can be conducted , although the viewing may also take place at a church .
the viewing may end with a prayer service ; in a roman catholic funeral , this may include a rosary .
a visitation is often held the evening before the day of the funeral .
however , when the deceased person is elderly the visitation may be held immediately preceding the funeral .
this allows elderly friends of the deceased a chance to view the body and attend the funeral in one trip , since it may be difficult for them to arrange travel ; this step may also be taken if the deceased has few survivors or the survivors want a funeral with only a small number of guests .
a memorial service , often called a funeral , is often officiated by clergy from the decedent's , or bereaved's , church or religion .
a funeral may take place at either a funeral home , church , or crematorium or cemetery chapel .
a funeral is held according to the family's choosing , which may be a few days after the time of death , allowing family members to attend the service .
this type of memorial service is most common for christians , and roman catholics call it a mass when eucharist ( communion ) is offered , the casket is closed and a priest says prayers and blessings .
a roman catholic funeral must take place in a parish church ( usually that of the deceased , or that of the family grave , or a parish to which the deceased had special links ) .
sometimes family members or friends of the dead will say something .
if the funeral service takes place in the funeral home ( mostly it takes place in the funeral home's chapel ) it can be directed by a clergy ( mostly for protestant churches and sometimes for catholic churches ) or hosted by a very close family member most common a parent .
in some traditions if this service takes place in a funeral home it is the same if it would take place in a church .
these services if taking place in a funeral home consists of prayers , blessings and eulogies from the family .
the " open-casket service " ( which is common in north america ) allows mourners to have a final opportunity to view the deceased and say good-bye .
there is an order of precedence when approaching the casket at this stage that usually starts with the immediate family ( siblings , parents , spouse , children ) ; followed by other mourners , after which the immediate family may file past again , so they are the last to view their loved one before the coffin is closed .
this opportunity can take place immediately before the service begins , or at the very end of the service .
a roman catholic funeral must be closed-casket , and relatives are expected to attend the few days before the service .
open casket funerals and visitations are very rare in some countries , such as the united kingdom and most european countries , where it is usual for only close relatives to actually see the deceased person and not uncommon for no one to do so .
the funeral service itself is almost invariably closed casket .
funeral homes are generally not used for funeral services , which are almost exclusively held in a church , cemetery , or crematorium chapel .
the deceased is usually transported from the funeral home to a church in a hearse , a specialized vehicle designed to carry casketed remains .
the deceased is often transported in a procession ( also called a funeral cortège ) , with the hearse , funeral service vehicles , and private automobiles traveling in a procession to the church or other location where the services will be held .
in a number of jurisdictions , special laws cover funeral processions – such as requiring most other vehicles to give right-of-way to a funeral procession .
funeral service vehicles may be equipped with light bars and special flashers to increase their visibility on the roads .
they may also all have their headlights on , to identify which vehicles are part of the cortege , although the practice also has roots in ancient roman customs .
after the funeral service , if the deceased is to be buried the funeral procession will proceed to a cemetery if not already there .
if the deceased is to be cremated , the funeral procession may then proceed to the crematorium .
religious funeral services commonly include prayers , readings from a sacred text , hymns ( sung either by the attendees or a hired vocalist ) and words of comfort by the clergy .
frequently , a relative or close friend will be asked to give a eulogy , which details happy memories and accomplishments rather than criticism .
sometimes the eulogy is delivered by clergy .
church bells may also be tolled both before and after the service .
in some religious denominations , for example , roman catholic , and anglican , eulogies from loved ones are somewhat discouraged during this service .
in such cases , the eulogy is only done by a member of the clergy .
this tradition is giving way to eulogies read by family members or friends .
in these religions the coffin is traditionally closed at the end of the wake and is not re-opened for the funeral service .
during the funeral and at the burial service , the casket may be covered with a large arrangement of flowers , called a casket spray .
if the deceased served in a branch of the armed forces , the casket may be covered with a national flag ; however , in the us , nothing should cover the national flag according to title *num* , united states code , chapter *num* , paragraph 8i .
if the funeral service is held in a church , the casket is normally covered in a white pall , which recalls the white garments of baptism .
funeral customs vary from country to country .
in the united states , any type of noise other than quiet whispering or mourning is considered disrespectful .
a traditional fire department funeral consists of two raised aerial ladders .
the firefighter ( s ) travel under the aerials on their ride , on the fire apparatus , to the cemetery .
once there , the grave service includes the playing of bagpipes .
the pipes have come to be a distinguishing feature of a fallen hero's funeral .
also a " last alarm bell " is rung .
a portable fire department bell is tolled at the conclusion of the ceremony .
at a religious burial service , conducted at the side of the grave , tomb , mausoleum or cremation , the body of the decedent is buried or cremated at the conclusion .
sometimes , the burial service will immediately follow the funeral , in which case a funeral procession travels from the site of the memorial service to the burial site .
in some other cases , the burial service is the funeral , in which case the procession might travel from the cemetery office to the grave site .
other times , the burial service takes place at a later time , when the final resting place is ready , if the death occurred in the middle of winter .
if the decedent served in a branch of the armed forces , military rites are often accorded at the burial service .
in many religious traditions , pallbearers , usually males who are relatives or friends of the decedent , will carry the casket from the chapel ( of a funeral home or church ) to the hearse , and from the hearse to the site of the burial service .
the pallbearers often sit in a special reserved section during the memorial service .
most religions expect coffins to be kept closed during the burial ceremony .
in eastern orthodox funerals , the coffins are reopened just before burial to allow mourners to look at the deceased one last time and give their final farewells .
greek funerals are an exception as the coffin is open during the whole procedure unless the state of the body does not allow it .
morticians may ensure that all jewelry , including wristwatch , that were displayed at the wake are in the casket before it is buried or entombed .
custom requires that everything goes into the ground ; however this is not true for jewish services .
jewish tradition stipulates that nothing of value is buried with the deceased .
in the case of cremation such items are usually removed before the body goes into the furnace .
pacemakers are removed prior to cremation – if left in they could explode .
the family of the deceased may wish to have only a very small , private service , with just the deceased's closest family members and friends attending .
this type of ceremony is not open to the public , but only to those invited .
a memorial service , or a commemoration is one given for the deceased when the body is not present .
the service takes place " after " cremation or burial at sea , after donation of the body to an academic or research institution , or after the ashes have been scattered .
it is also significant when the person is missing and presumed dead , or known to be deceased though the body is not recoverable .
these services often take place at a funeral home ; however , they can be held in a home , school , workplace , church or other location of some significance .
a memorial service may include speeches ( eulogies ) , prayers , poems , or songs to commemorate the deceased .
pictures of the deceased and flowers are usually placed where the coffin would normally be placed .
after the sudden deaths of important public officials , public memorial services have been held by communities , including those without any specific connection to the deceased .
for examples , community memorial services were held after the assassinations of us presidents james a .
garfield and william mckinley .
a good funeral ( as they were called ) had one draw the curtains for a period of time ; at the wake , when new visitors arrived , they would enter from the front door and leave through the back door .
the women stayed at home whilst the men attended the funeral , the village priest would then visit the family at their home to talk about the deceased and to console them .
the first child of william price , a welsh neo-druidic priest , died in *num* .
believing that it was wrong to bury a corpse , and thereby pollute the earth , price decided to cremate his son's body , a practice which had been common in celtic societies .
the police arrested him for the illegal disposal of a corpse .
price successfully argued in court that while the law did not state that cremation was legal , it also did not state that it was illegal .
the case set a precedent that , together with the activities of the newly-founded cremation society of great britain , led to the cremation act *num* .
the act imposed procedural requirements before a cremation could occur and restricted the practice to authorised places .
in finland , religious funerals ( hautajaiset ) are quite ascetic .
the local priest or minister says prayers and blesses the deceased in their house .
the mourners ( saattoväki ) traditionally bring food to the mourners ' house .
nowadays the deceased is put into the coffin in the place where they died .
the undertaker will pick up the coffin and place it in the hearse and drive it to the funeral home , while the closest relatives or friends of the deceased will follow the hearse in a funeral procession in their own cars .
the coffin will be held at the funeral home until the day of the funeral .
the funeral services may be divided into two parts .
first is the church service ( siunaustilaisuus ) in a cemetery chapel or local church , than the burial .
the majority of italians are roman catholic and follow catholic funeral traditions .
historically , mourners would walk in a funeral procession to the gravesite ; today vehicles are used .
in poland , in urban areas , there are usually two , or just one “stop” .
the body , brought by a hearse from the mortuary , may be taken to a church or to a cemetery chapel , then there is a funeral mass or service at cemetery chapel .
following the mass or service the casket is carried in procession ( usually on foot ) on a hearse to the grave .
once at the gravesite , the priest will commence the graveside committal service and the casket is lowered .
the mass or service usually takes place at the cemetery .
in some traditional rural areas , the wake ( " czuwanie " ) takes place in the house of the deceased or their relatives .
the body lies in state for three days in the house .
the funeral usually takes place on the third day .
family , neighbors and friends gather and pray during the day and night on those three days and nights .
there are usually three stages in the funeral ceremony ( " ceremonia pogrzebowa " , " pogrzeb " ) : the wake ( " czuwanie " ) , then the body is carried by procession ( usually on foot ) or people drive in their own cars to the church or cemetery chapel for mass , and another procession by foot to the gravesite .
after the funeral , families gather for a post-funeral get-together ( " stypa " ) .
it can be at the family home , or at a function hall .
in poland cremation is less popular because the catholic church in poland doesn't allow it .
cremation is popular among non-religious and protestants in poland .
an old funeral rite from the scottish highlands involved burying the deceased with a wooden plate resting on his chest .
on the plate were placed a small amount of earth and salt , to represent the future of the deceased .
the earth hinted that the body would decay and become one with the earth , while the salt represented the soul , which does not decay .
this rite was known as " earth laid upon a corpse " .
this practice was also carried out in ireland , as well as in parts of england , particularly in leicestershire , although in england the salt was intended to prevent air from distending the corpse .
in spain , a burial or cremation may occur very soon after a death .
most spaniards are roman catholics and follow catholic funeral traditions .
first , family and friends sit with the deceased during the wake until the burial .
wakes are a social event and a time to laugh and honor the dead .
following the wake comes the funeral mass ( tanatorio ) at the church or cemetery chapel .
following the mass is the burial .
the coffin is then moved from the church to the local cemetery , often with a procession of locals walking behind the hearse .
a growing number of families choose to hold a life celebration or celebration of life event for the deceased in addition to or instead of a traditional funeral .
such ceremonies may be held outside the funeral home or place of worship ; restaurants , parks , pubs and sporting facilities are popular choices based on the specific interests of the deceased .
celebrations of life focus on a life that was lived , including the person’s best qualities , interests , achievements and impact , rather than mourning a death .
some events are portrayed as joyous parties , instead of a traditional somber funeral .
taking on happy and hopeful tones , celebrations of life discourage wearing black and focus on the deceased’s individuality .
an extreme example might have " a fully stocked open bar , catered food , and even favors .
" notable recent celebrations of life ceremonies include those for rené angélil and maya angelou .
originating in new orleans , louisiana , u .
s .
, alongside the emergence of jazz music in late *ord* and early *ord* centuries , the jazz funeral is a traditionally african-american burial ceremony and celebration of life unique to new orleans that involves a parading funeral procession accompanied by a brass band playing somber hymns followed by upbeat jazz music .
traditional jazz funerals begin with a processional led by the funeral director , family , friends , and the brass band , i .
e .
, the " main line " , who march from the funeral service to the burial site while the band plays slow dirges and christian hymns .
after the body is buried , or " cut loose " , the band begins to play up-tempo , joyful jazz numbers , as the main line parades through the streets and crowds of " second liners " join in and begin dancing and marching along , transforming the funeral into a street festival .
the terms " green burial " and " natural burial " , used interchangeably , apply to ceremonies that aim to return the body with the earth with little to no use of artificial , non-biodegradable materials .
as a concept , the idea of uniting an individual with the natural world after he or she dies appears as old as human death itself , being widespread before the rise of the funeral industry .
holding environmentally-friendly ceremonies as a modern concept first attracted widespread attention in the 1990s .
in terms of north america , the opening of the first explicitly " green " burial cemetery in the u .
s .
took place in the state of south carolina .
however , the green burial council , which came into being in *num* , has based its operations out of california .
the instition works to officially certifies burial practices for funeral homes and cemeteries , making sure that appropriate materials are used .
religiously , some adherents of the roman catholic church often have particular interest in " green " funerals given the faith's preference to full burial of the body as well as the theological commitments to care for the environment stated in catholic social teaching .
those with concerns about the effects on the environment of traditional burial or cremation may be placed into a natural bio-degradable green burial shroud .
that , in turn , sometimes gets placed into a simple coffin made of cardboard or other easily biodegradable material .
furthermore , individuals may choose their final resting place to be in a specially designed park or woodland , sometimes known as an " ecocemetery " , and may have a tree or other item of greenery planted over their grave both as a contribution to the environment and a symbol of remembrance .
humanists uk organises a network of humanist funeral celebrants or officiants across england and wales , northern ireland , and the channel islands and a similar network is organised by the humanist society scotland .
humanist officiants are trained and experienced in devising and conducting suitable ceremonies for non-religious individuals .
humanist funerals recognise no " afterlife " , but celebrate the life of the person who has died .
in the twenty-first century , humanist funerals were held for well-known people including claire rayner , keith floyd , linda smith , and ronnie barker .
in areas outside of the united kingdom , the republic of ireland has featured an increasing number of non-religious funeral arrangements according to publications such as " dublin live " .
this has occurred in parallel with a trend of increasing numbers of people carefully scripting their own funerals before they die , writing the details of their own ceremonies .
the irish association of funeral directors has reported that funerals without a religious focus occur mainly in more urbanized areas in contrast to rural territories .
notable secular-based funerals have been held in other nations such as the republic of malta , in which civil rights activist and humanist ramon casha had a large scale event at the radisson blu golden sands resort devoted to laying him to rest .
although such non-religious ceremonies are " a rare scene in maltese society " due to the large role of the roman catholic church within that country's culture , according to " lovin malta " , " more and more maltese people want to know about alternate forms of burial .
.
.
without any religion being involved .
" actual events during secular funerals vary , but they frequently reflect upon the interests and personality of the deceased .
for example , the ceremony for the aforementioned keith floyd , a restaurateur and television personality , included a reading of rudyard kipling's poetic work " if— " and a performance by musician bill padley .
organizations such as the irish institute of celebrants have stated that more and more regular individuals request training for administering funeral ceremonies , instead of leaving things to other individuals .
civil funerals are an alternative to religious or humanist ceremonies in the uk .
unlike a humanist funeral , a civil funeral can contain some religious content , such as hymns or reading if the family wish .
funerals specifically for fallen members of fire or police services are common in united states and canada .
these funerals involve honour guards from police forces and / or fire services from across the country and sometimes from overseas .
a parade of officers often precedes or follows the hearse carrying the fallen comrade .
a masonic funeral is held at the request of a departed mason or family member .
the service may be held in any of the usual places or a lodge room with committal at graveside , or the complete service can be performed at any of the aforementioned places without a separate committal .
freemasonry does not require a masonic funeral .
there is no single masonic funeral service .
some grand lodges ( it is a worldwide organisation ) have a prescribed service .
some of the customs include the presiding officer wearing a hat while doing his part in the service , the lodge members placing sprigs of evergreen on the casket , and a small white leather apron may being placed in or on the casket .
the hat may be worn because it is masonic custom ( in some places in the world ) for the presiding officer to have his head covered while officiating .
to masons the sprig of evergreen is a symbol of immortality .
a mason wears a white leather apron , called a " lambskin , " on becoming a mason , and he may continue to wear it even in death .
in most east asian , south asian and many southeast asian cultures , the wearing of white is symbolic of death .
in these societies , white or off-white robes are traditionally worn to symbolize that someone has died and can be seen worn among relatives of the deceased during a funeral ceremony .
in chinese culture , red is strictly forbidden as it is a traditionally symbolic color of happiness .
exceptions are sometimes made if the deceased has reached an advanced age such as *num* , in which case the funeral is considered a celebration , where wearing white with some red is acceptable .
contemporary western influence however has meant that dark-colored or black attire is now often also acceptable for mourners to wear ( particularly for those outside the family ) .
in such cases , mourners wearing dark colors at times may also wear a white or off-white armband or white robe .
contemporary south korean funerals typically mix western culture with traditional korean culture , largely depending on socio-economic status , region , and religion .
in almost all cases , all related males in the family wear woven armbands representing seniority and lineage in relation to the deceased , and must grieve next to the deceased for a period of three days before burying the body .
during this period of time , it is customary for the males in the family to personally greet all who come to show respect .
while burials have been preferred historically , recent trends show a dramatic increase in cremations due to shortages of proper burial sites and difficulties in maintaining a traditional grave .
the ashes of the cremated corpse are commonly stored in columbaria .
most japanese funerals are conducted with buddhist and / or shinto rites .
many ritually bestow a new name on the deceased ; funerary names typically use obsolete or archaic kanji and words , to avoid the likelihood of the name being used in ordinary speech or writing .
the new names are typically chosen by a buddhist priest , after consulting the family of the deceased .
most japanese are cremated .
religious thought among the japanese people is generally a blend of shintō and buddhist beliefs .
in modern practice , specific rites concerning an individual's passage through life are generally ascribed to one of these two faiths .
funerals and follow-up memorial services fall under the purview of buddhist ritual , and *num* % japanese funerals are conducted in a buddhist manner .
aside from the religious aspect , a japanese funeral usually includes a wake , the cremation of the deceased , and inclusion within the family grave .
follow-up services are then performed by a buddhist priest on specific anniversaries after death .
according to an estimate in *num* , *num* .
*num* % of all deceased japanese are cremated .
in most cases the cremated remains are placed in an urn and then deposited in a family grave .
in recent years however , alternative methods of disposal have become more popular , including scattering of the ashes , burial in outer space , and conversion of the cremated remains into a diamond that can be set in jewelry .
funeral practices and burial customs in the philippines encompass a wide range of personal , cultural , and traditional beliefs and practices which filipinos observe in relation to death , bereavement , and the proper honoring , interment , and remembrance of the dead .
these practices have been vastly shaped by the variety of religions and cultures that entered the philippines throughout its complex history .
most if not all present-day filipinos , like their ancestors , believe in some form of an afterlife and give considerable attention to honouring the dead .
except amongst filipino muslims ( who are obliged to bury a corpse less than *num* hours after death ) , a wake is generally held from three days to a week .
wakes in rural areas are usually held in the home , while in urban settings the dead is typically displayed in a funeral home .
friends and neighbors bring food to the family , such as " pancit " noodles and " bibingka " cake " ; " any leftovers are never taken home by guests , because of a superstition against it .
apart from spreading the news about someone’s death verbally , obituaries are also published in newspapers .
although the majority of the filipino people are christians , they have retained some traditional indigenous beliefs concerning death .
in korea , funerals are typically held for three days and different things are done in each day .
the first day : on the day a person dies , the body is moved to a funeral hall .
they prepare clothes for the body and put them into a chapel of rest .
then food is prepared for the deceased .
it is made up of three bowls of rice and three kinds of korean side dishes .
also , there has to be three coins and three straw shoes .
this can be cancelled if the family of the dead person have a particular religion .
on the second day the funeral director washes the body and shrouding is done .
then , a family member of the dead person puts uncooked rice in the mouth of the body .
this step does not have to be done if the family has a certain religion .
after putting the rice in the mouth , the body is moved into a coffin .
family members , including close relatives , of the dead person will wear mourning clothing .
typically , mourning for a woman includes korean traditional clothes , hanbok , and mourning for man includes a suit .
the color has to be black .
the ritual ceremony begins when they are done with changing clothes and preparing foods for the dead person .
the ritual ceremony is different depending on their religion .
after the ritual ceremony family members will start to greet guests .
on the third day , the family decides whether to bury the body in the ground or cremate the body .
if they decide to bury the body in the ground , three people from the family sprinkle dirt on the coffin three times .
in case of cremation , there are no specific things to be done like ground burial .
the only thing needed is a jar to place burned bones in and a place to keep the jar .
other than these facts , in korea , people who come to the funeral bring condolence money .
also , a food called yukgaejang is served to guests oftentimes with korean alcohol called soju .
like many other cultures , funeral practices in mongolia are the most important rituals that they follow .
they have mixed their rituals with buddhists due to creating a new , unique way of death .
for mongolians who are very strict when it comes to their traditions , there were three different ways of burial that families could choose from .
the main one being open-air burial , and the others being cremation and embalming .
there were many factors that went into deciding which funeral practice to do .
these consisted of the family's social standing , the cause of death and the specific location they died at .
the main people that were chosen to be embalmed were the people apart of the lamaistic church , by choosing this practice , they are usually buried in a sitting position .
this would show that they would always be in the position of prayer .
also , more important people such as nobles would be buried with weapons , horses and food in their coffins to help them prepare for the next world .
the coffin is built specifically designed by three to four relatives , mainly men .
in order to determine how big the coffin will be , the builders bring planks to the hut that the dead is located and put together the box and the lid to go with it .
the same people who help put together the coffin also help decorate the funeral .
most of this work is done after the sun goes down .
with very specific instruction , they work on decorations inside the youngest daughters house .
the reason for this is so the deceased is not disturbed at night .
in vietnam , buddhism is the most commonly practiced religion , however , most burial methods do not coincide with the buddhist belief of cremation .
the body of the deceased is moved to a loved one’s house and placed in an expensive coffin .
the body usually stays there for about three days , allowing time for people to visit and place gifts in the mouth .
this stems from the vietnamese belief that the dead should be surrounded by their family .
this belief goes so far as to include superstition as well .
if somebody is dying in vietnamese culture , they are rushed home from the hospital so they can die there , because if they die away from home it is believed to be bad luck to take a corpse home .
many services are also held in the vietnamese burial practices .
one is held before moving the coffin from the home and the other is held at the burial site .
after the burial of the loved one , incense is burned at the gravesite and respect is paid to all the nearby graves .
following this , the family and friends return to the home and enjoy a feast to celebrate the life of the recently departed .
even after the deceased has been buried , the respect and honor continues .
for the first *num* days after the burying , the family holds a memorial service every *num* days , where the family and friends come back together to celebrate the life of their loved one .
after this , they meet again on the *ord* day after the death , then *num* days after the death , and finally they meet on the anniversary of the death of their loved one , a whole year later , to continue to continue to celebrate the glorious life of their recently departed .
african funerals are usually open to many visitors .
the custom of burying the dead in the floor of dwelling-houses has been to some degree prevalent on the gold coast of africa .
the ceremony depends on the traditions of the ethnicity the deceased belonged to .
the funeral may last for as much as a week .
another custom , a kind of memorial , frequently takes place seven years after the person's death .
these funerals and especially the memorials may be extremely expensive for the family in question .
cattle , sheep , goats , and poultry , may be offered and then consumed .
the ashanti and akan ethnic groups in ghana typically wear red and black during funerals .
for special family members , there is typically a funeral celebration with singing and dancing to honor the life of the deceased .
afterwards , the akan hold a sombre funeral procession and burial with intense displays of sorrow .
other funerals in ghana are held with the deceased put in elaborate " fantasy coffins " colored and shaped after a certain object , such as a fish , crab , boat , and even airplanes .
the kane kwei carpentry workshop in teshie , named after seth kane kwei who invented this new style of coffin , has become an international reference for this form of art .
some diseases , such as ebola can be spread by funerary customs including touching the dead .
however , safe burials can be achieved by following simple procedures .
for example , letting relatives see the face of the dead before bodybags are closed and taking photographs , if desired , can greatly reduce the risk of infection without impacting too heavily on the customs of burial .
in kenya funerals are an expensive undertaking .
keeping bodies in morgues to allow for fund raising is a common occurrence more so in urban areas .
some families opt to bury their dead in the countryside homes instead of urban cemeteries , thus spending more money on transporting the dead .
the first emperor of the qin dynasty , qin shi huang’s mausoleum is located in the lintong district of xi’an , shaanxi province .
qin shi huang’s tomb is one of the world heritage sites in china .
its remarkable feature and size have been known as one of the most important historical sites in china .
qin shi huang is the first emperor who united china for the first time .
the mausoleum was built in *num* bc after he became the emperor of qin dynasty .
ancient chinese mausoleums have unique characteristics compared to other cultures .
ancient chinese thought that the soul remains even after death , ( immortal soul ) regarded funeral practices as an important tradition .
from their long history , the construction of mausoleums has developed over time , creating monumental and massive ancient emperor’s tomb .
archeologists have found more than *num* , *num* life-sized figures resembling an army surrounding the emperor’s tomb .
the primary purpose of the placement of terracotta army is to protect the emperor’s tomb .
the figures were composed of clay and fragments of pottery .
the terracotta army resembles the soldiers , horses , government officials , and even musicians .
all of the figures were made so acutely and delicately .
the arrangement and the weapons they are carrying resembled entirely to the real weapons at that time .
furthermore , their facial features weren’t identical , but with unique features and details .
the imperial tombs of ming and qing dynasties are included as world heritage sites .
the three imperial tombs of qin dynasty were additionally inscribed in *num* and *num* .
the three tombs were all built in the *ord* century .
the tombs have been constructed to praise the emperors of qing dynasty and their ancestors .
in tradition , chinese have followed the feng shui to build and decorate the interior .
all of the tombs are strictly made followed by the feng shui theory .
harmony between the architecture and the surrounding topographical structure were seen as an integral part of nature .
according to the feng shi theory , to build a tomb , there must be a mountain on the northern side and low land on the south .
in the west and east , a river must be located .
the imperial tombs of ming and qing dynasties clearly shows the cultural and architectural tradition that has swayed the area for more than *num* years .
there is a great harmony between the surrounding nature and the architecture .
in chinese culture , the tombs were considered as a portal between the world of the living and the dead .
chinese believed that the portal would divide the soul into two parts .
the half of the soul would go to heaven , and the other half would remain within the physical body .
from about *num* to *num* there were two professions in europe now almost totally forgotten .
the mute is depicted in art quite frequently but in literature is probably best known from dickens's " oliver twist " .
oliver is working for mr .
sowerberry when this conversation takes place : " there's an expression of melancholy in his face , my dear .
.
.
which is very interesting .
he would make a delightful mute , my love " .
and in " martin chuzzlewit " , moult , the undertaker , states , " this promises to be one of the most impressive funerals .
.
.
no limitation of expense .
.
.
i have orders to put on my whole establishment of mutes , and mutes come very dear , mr pecksniff .
" the main purpose of a funeral mute was to stand around at funerals with a sad , pathetic face .
a symbolic protector of the deceased , the mute would usually stand near the door of the home or church .
in victorian times , mutes would wear somber clothing including black cloaks , top hats with trailing hatbands , and gloves .
the professional mourner , generally a woman , would shriek and wail ( often while clawing her face and tearing at her clothing ) , to encourage others to weep .
forms of professional mourning are recorded from ancient greece , and were commonly employed throughout europe until the beginning of the nineteenth century .
the *num* award-winning philippine comedy " crying ladies " revolves around the lives of three women who are part-time professional mourners for the chinese-filipino community in manila's chinatown .
according to the film , the chinese use professional mourners to help expedite the entry of a deceased loved one's soul into heaven by giving the impression that he or she was a good and loving person , well-loved by many .
high-ranking national figures such as heads of state , prominent politicians , military figures , national heroes and eminent cultural figures may be offered state funerals .
some cultures place the dead in tombs of various sorts , either individually , or in specially designated tracts of land that house tombs .
burial in a graveyard is one common form of tomb .
in some places , burials are impractical because the groundwater is too high ; therefore tombs are placed above ground , as is the case in new orleans , louisiana , us .
elsewhere , a separate building for a tomb is usually reserved for the socially prominent and wealthy ; grand , above-ground tombs are called mausoleums .
the socially prominent sometimes had the privilege of having their corpses stored in church crypts .
in more recent times , however , this has often been forbidden by hygiene laws .
burial was not always permanent .
in some areas , burial grounds needed to be reused due to limited space .
in these areas , once the dead have decomposed to skeletons , the bones are removed ; after their removal they can be placed in an ossuary .
"burial at sea " in past generations has meant the deliberate disposal of a corpse into the ocean , wrapped and tied with weights to make sure it sinks .
it has been a common practice in navies and seafaring nations ; in the church of england , special forms of funeral service were added to the book of common prayer to cover it .
in today's generation , " burial at sea " may also refer to the scattering of ashes in the ocean , while " whole body burial at sea " refers to the entire uncremated body being placed in the ocean at great depths .
laws vary by jurisdictions .
science fiction writers have frequently extended the concept to a " burial in space " .
cremation is also an old custom ; it was the usual mode of disposing of a corpse in ancient rome ( along with graves covered with heaped mounds , also found in greece , particularly at the karameikos graveyard in monastiraki ) .
vikings were occasionally cremated in their longships , and afterwards the location of the site was marked with standing stones .
since the latter part of the twentieth century , despite the objections of some religious groups , cremation has become increasingly popular .
jewish law ( " halakha " ) forbids cremation , believing that the soul of a cremated person will be unable to find its final repose .
the roman catholic church forbade it for many years , but since *num* the church has allowed it , as long as it is not done to express disbelief in bodily resurrection .
the church specifies that cremated remains are either buried or entombed ; they do not allow cremated remains to be scattered or kept at home .
many catholic cemeteries now have columbarium niches for cremated remains , or specific sections for those remains .
some denominations of protestantism allow cremation ; the more conservative denominations generally do not .
the eastern orthodox church and islam also forbid cremation .
among hindus , jains , sikhs and some sects of buddhists such as those found in japan , cremation is common .
rarer forms of disposal of the dead include exposure to the elements and to scavenger animals .
this includes various forms of excarnation , where the corpse is stripped of the flesh , leaving only the bones , which are then either buried or stored elsewhere , in ossuaries or tombs for example .
this was done by some groups of native americans in protohistoric times .
ritual exposure of the dead ( without preservation of the bones ) is practiced by zoroastrians in mumbai and karachi , where bodies are placed in " towers of silence " , where vultures and other carrion-eating birds dispose of the corpses .
in the present-day structures , the bones are collected in a central pit where , assisted by lime , they , too , eventually decompose .
exposure to scavenger birds ( with preservation of some , but not all bones ) is also practiced by some high-altitude tibetan buddhists , where practical considerations such as the lack of firewood and a shallow active layer seem to have led to the practice known as " jhator " or " giving alms to the birds " .
mummification is the drying of bodies to preserve them .
the most famous practitioners were ancient egyptians—many nobles and highly ranked bureaucrats had their corpses embalmed and stored in luxurious sarcophagi inside their funeral mausoleums .
pharaohs stored their embalmed corpses in pyramids .
cannibalism has earlier been practiced post-mortem in parts of papua new guinea .
the practice has been linked to the spread of kuru , a prion disease .
promession is a new method of disposing of the body .
patented by a swedish company , a promession is also known as an " ecological funeral " .
its main purpose is to return the body to soil quickly while minimizing pollution and resource consumption .
it consists of separating the body from the coffin , freezing it with liquid nitrogen , vibrating it into small particles , freeze drying it , separating any metals , and placing the dry powder remains in a biodegradable casket in top soil .
some people choose to make their funeral arrangements in advance so that at the time of their death , their wishes are known to their family .
however , the extent to which decisions regarding the disposition of a decedent's remains ( including funeral arrangements ) can be controlled by the decedent while still alive vary from one jurisdiction to another .
in the united states , there are states which allow one to make these decisions for oneself if desired , for example by appointing an agent to carry out one's wishes ; in other states , the law allows the decedent's next-of-kin to make the final decisions about the funeral without taking the wishes of the decedent into account .
the decedent may , in most u .
s .
jurisdictions , provide instructions as to the funeral by means of a last will and testament .
these instructions can be given some legal effect if bequests are made contingent on the heirs carrying them out , with alternative gifts if they are not followed .
this requires the will to become available in time ; aspects of the disposition of the remains of us president franklin delano roosevelt ran contrary to a number of his stated wishes , which were found in a safe that was not opened until after the funeral .
some people donate their bodies to a medical school for use in research or education .
medical students frequently study anatomy from donated cadavers ; they are also useful in forensic research .
some medical conditions , such as amputations or various surgeries can make the cadaver unsuitable for these purposes ; in other cases the bodies of people who had certain medical conditions are useful for research into those conditions .
many medical schools rely on the donation of cadavers for the teaching of anatomy .
it is also possible to donate organs and tissue after death , for treating the sick , or for research .
empress genshō genshō's reign spanned the years *num* through *num* .
in the history of japan , genshō was the fifth of eight women to take on the role of empress regnant .
the four female monarchs before genshō were : suiko , kōgyoku , jitō and genmei .
the three women sovereigns reigning after genshō were kōken , meishō , and go-sakuramachi .
before her ascension to the chrysanthemum throne , her personal name ( " imina " ) was hidaka"-hime " .
genshō was an elder sister of emperor monmu and daughter of prince kusakabe and his wife who later became empress genmei .
therefore , she was a granddaughter of emperor tenmu and empress jitō by her father and a granddaughter of emperor tenji through her mother .
empress genshō's succession to the throne was intended as a regency until prince obito , the son of her deceased younger brother monmu , was mature enough to ascend the throne .
obito would later become the emperor shōmu .
obito was appointed crown prince in *num* by empress genmei .
in the next year , *num* , empress genmei , then in her fifties , abdicated in favor of her daughter genshō .
obito was then *num* years old .
obito remained the crown prince , heir to the new empress .
fujiwara no fuhito , the most powerful courtier in genmei's court , remained at his post until his death in *num* .
after his death , prince nagaya , a grandson of tenmu and the empress genshō's cousin , seized power .
this power shift was a background for later conflicts between nagaya and fuhito's four sons during the reign of emperor shōmu ( formerly prince obito ) .
under genshō's reign , the " nihon shoki " was finished in *num* .
this was the first japanese history book .
organization of the law system known as the " ritsuryō " was continued under the initiatives of fuhito until his death .
these laws and codes were edited and enacted by fujiwara no nakamaro , a grandson of fuhito , and published as " yōrō ritsuryō " under the name of fuhito .
the taxation system which had been introduced by empress jitō in the late *ord* century began to malfunction .
to compensate for the decreased tax revenue , the " act of possession in three generations " , an initiative of prince nagaya , was enacted in *num* .
under this act , people were allowed to possess a newly cultivated field once every three generations .
in the fourth generation , the right of possession would revert to the national government .
this act was intended to motivate new cultivation , but it only remained in effect for about *num* years .
empress genshō reigned for nine years .
although there were seven other reigning empresses , their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal imperial bloodline , which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the *ord* century .
empress genmei , who was succeeded by her daughter , remains the sole exception to this conventional argument .
in *num* , genshō abdicated in favor of her nephew , who would be known as emperor shōmu .
genshō lived for *num* years after she stepped down from the throne .
she never married and had no children .
she died at age *num* .
empress genshō's grave is located in nara .
this empress is traditionally venerated at a memorial shinto shrine ( " misasagi " ) , also in nara .
the imperial household agency has designated this location as monmu's mausoleum , and has been formally named " nahoyama no nishi no misasagi " .
the imperial tomb can be visited today in narazaka-chō , nara city .
is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the emperor of japan in pre-meiji eras .
in general , this elite group included only three to four men at a time .
these were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career .
during genshō's reign , this apex of the " daijō-kan " included : the years of genshō's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or " nengō " .
battle of waterloo the battle of waterloo was fought on sunday , *num* june *num* near waterloo in belgium , part of the united kingdom of the netherlands at the time .
a french army under the command of napoleon bonaparte was defeated by two of the armies of the seventh coalition : a british-led allied army under the command of the duke of wellington , and a prussian army under the command of field marshal blücher .
the battle marked the end of the napoleonic wars .
upon napoleon's return to power in march *num* , many states that had opposed him formed the seventh coalition and began to mobilise armies .
wellington and blücher's armies were cantoned close to the northeastern border of france .
napoleon chose to attack them separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of france with other members of the coalition .
on *num* june , he successfully attacked the bulk of the prussian army at the battle of ligny with his main force , while a portion of the french army simultaneously attacked an anglo-allied army at the battle of quatre bras .
despite holding his ground at quatre bras , the defeat of the prussians forced wellington to withdraw north to waterloo on the *ord* .
napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the prussians , who had in good order .
this resulted in the separate and simultaneous battle of wavre with the prussian rear-guard .
upon learning that the prussian army was able to support him , wellington decided to offer battle on the mont-saint-jean escarpment across the brussels road .
here he withstood repeated attacks by the french throughout the afternoon of the *ord* , aided by the progressively arriving prussians .
in the evening , napoleon committed his last reserves , the senior battalions of the french imperial guard infantry .
the desperate final attack of the guard was narrowly beaten back .
with the prussians breaking through on the french right flank , wellington's anglo-allied army counter-attacked in the centre , and the french army was routed .
waterloo was the decisive engagement of the waterloo campaign and napoleon's last .
according to wellington , the battle was " the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life .
" napoleon abdicated four days later , and coalition forces entered paris on *num* july .
the defeat at waterloo ended napoleon's rule as emperor of the french and marked the end of his hundred days return from exile .
this ended the first french empire and set a chronological milestone between serial european wars and decades of relative peace .
the battlefield is located in the municipalities of braine-l'alleud and lasne , about south of brussels , and about from the town of waterloo .
the site of the battlefield today is dominated by the monument of the lion's mound , constructed from earth taken from the battlefield itself ; the topography of the battlefield near the mound has not been preserved .
on *num* march *num* , six days before napoleon reached paris , the powers at the congress of vienna .
four days later , the united kingdom , russia , austria , and prussia mobilised armies to defeat napoleon .
critically outnumbered , napoleon knew that once his attempts at dissuading one or more members of the seventh coalition from invading france had failed , his only chance of remaining in power was to attack before the coalition mobilised .
had napoleon succeeded in destroying the existing coalition forces south of brussels before they were reinforced , he might have been able to drive the british back to the sea and knock the prussians out of the war .
crucially , this would have bought him time to recruit and train more men before turning his armies against the austrians and russians .
an additional consideration for napoleon was that a french victory might cause french-speaking sympathisers in belgium to launch a friendly revolution .
also , coalition troops in belgium were largely second-line , as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty , and most of the british veterans of the peninsular war had been sent to north america to fight in the war of *num* .
the initial dispositions of british commander arthur wellesley , *ord* duke of wellington , were intended to counter the threat of napoleon enveloping the coalition armies by moving through mons to the south-west of brussels .
this would have pushed wellington closer to the prussian forces , led by gebhard leberecht von blücher , but may have cut wellington's communications with his base at ostend .
in order to delay wellington's deployment , napoleon spread false intelligence which suggested that wellington's supply chain from the channel ports would be cut .
by june , napoleon had raised a total army strength of about *num* , *num* men .
the force at his disposal at waterloo was less than one third that size , but the rank and file were nearly all loyal and experienced soldiers .
napoleon divided his army into a left wing commanded by marshal ney , a right wing commanded by marshal grouchy and a reserve under his command ( although all three elements remained close enough to support one another ) .
crossing the frontier near charleroi before dawn on *num* june , the french , securing napoleon's " central position " between wellington's and blücher's armies .
he hoped this would prevent them from combining , and he would be able to destroy first the prussian's army , then wellington's .
only very late on the night of *num* june was wellington certain that the charleroi attack was the main french thrust .
in the early hours of *num* june , at the duchess of richmond's ball in brussels , he received a dispatch from the prince of orange and was shocked by the speed of napoleon's advance .
he hastily ordered his army to concentrate on quatre bras , where the prince of orange , with the brigade of prince bernhard of saxe-weimar , was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of ney's left wing .
ney's orders were to secure the crossroads of quatre bras , so that he could later swing east and reinforce napoleon if necessary .
ney found the crossroads of quatre bras lightly held by the prince of orange , who repelled ney's initial attacks but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of french troops .
first reinforcements , and then wellington arrived .
he took command and drove ney back , securing the crossroads by early evening , too late to send help to the prussians , who had already been defeated .
meanwhile on *num* june , napoleon attacked and defeated blücher's prussians at the battle of ligny using part of the reserve and the right wing of his army .
the prussian centre gave way under heavy french assaults , but the flanks held their ground .
went uninterrupted and seemingly unnoticed by the french .
the bulk of their rearguard units held their positions until about midnight , and some elements did not move out until the following morning , ignored by the french .
crucially , the prussians did not retreat to the east , along their own lines of communication .
instead , they , too , fell back northwards—parallel to wellington's line of march , still within supporting distance and in communication with him throughout .
the prussians rallied on bülow's iv corps , which had not been engaged at ligny and was in a strong position south of wavre .
with the prussian retreat from ligny , wellington's position at quatre bras was untenable .
the next day he withdrew northwards , to a defensive position he had reconnoitred the previous year—the low ridge of mont-saint-jean , south of the village of waterloo and the sonian forest .
napoleon , with the reserves , made a late start on *num* june and joined ney at quatre bras at *num* : *num* to attack wellington's army but found the position empty .
the french pursued wellington's retreating army to waterloo ; however , due to bad weather , mud and the head start that napoleon's tardy advance had allowed wellington , apart from a cavalry action at genappe , there was no substantial engagement .
before leaving ligny , napoleon had ordered grouchy , who commanded the right wing , to with *num* , *num* men .
a late start , uncertainty about the direction the prussians had taken , and the vagueness of the orders given to him , meant that grouchy was too late to prevent the prussian army reaching wavre , from where it could march to support wellington .
more importantly , the heavily outnumbered prussian rear-guard was able to use the river dyle to enable a savage and prolonged action to delay grouchy .
as the *ord* of june drew to a close , wellington's army had arrived at its position at waterloo , with the main body of napoleon's army following .
blücher's army was gathering in and around wavre , around to the east of the city .
early on the morning of the *ord* , wellington received an assurance from blücher that the prussian army would support him .
he decided to hold his ground and give battle .
three armies were involved in the battle : napoleon's " armée du nord " , a multinational army under wellington , and a prussian army under blücher .
the french army of around *num* , *num* consisted of *num* , *num* infantry , *num* , *num* cavalry , and *num* , *num* artillery with *num* guns .
napoleon had used conscription to fill the ranks of the french army throughout his rule , but he did not conscript men for the *num* campaign .
his troops were mainly veterans with considerable experience and a fierce devotion to their emperor .
the cavalry in particular was both numerous and formidable , and included fourteen regiments of armoured heavy cavalry , and seven of highly versatile lancers who were armed with lances , sabres and firearms .
however as the army took shape , french officers were allocated to units as they presented themselves for duty , so that many units were commanded by officers the soldiers didn't know , and often didn't trust .
crucially , some of these officers had little experience in working together as a unified force , so that support for other units was often not given .
the french army was forced to march through rain and black coal-dust mud to reach waterloo , and then to contend with mud and rain as it slept in the open .
little food was available for the soldiers , but nevertheless the veteran french soldiers were fiercely loyal to napoleon .
wellington later said that he had " an infamous army , very weak and ill-equipped , and a very inexperienced staff " .
his troops consisted of *num* , *num* men : *num* , *num* infantry , *num* , *num* cavalry , and *num* , *num* artillery with *num* guns .
of these , *num* , *num* were british , with another *num* , *num* from the king's german legion ( kgl ) .
all of the british army troops were regular soldiers , but only *num* , *num* of them were peninsular war veterans .
in addition , there were *num* , *num* dutch and belgian troops , *num* , *num* from hanover , *num* , *num* from brunswick , and *num* , *num* from nassau .
many of the troops in the coalition armies were inexperienced .
the dutch army had been re-established in *num* , following the earlier defeat of napoleon .
with the exception of the british and some from hanover and brunswick who had fought with the british army in spain , many of the professional soldiers in the coalition armies had spent some of their time in the french army or in armies allied to the napoleonic regime .
the historian barbero states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between british and foreign troops did not prove significant under fire .
wellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry , having only seven british and three dutch regiments .
the duke of york imposed many of his staff officers on wellington , including his second-in-command the earl of uxbridge .
uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had carte blanche from wellington to commit these forces at his discretion .
wellington stationed a further *num* , *num* troops at halle , away to the west .
they were mostly composed of dutch troops under prince of orange's younger brother prince frederick of the netherlands .
they were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the french forces , and also to act as a rearguard if wellington was forced to retreat towards antwerp and the coast .
the prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation .
in *num* , the former reserve regiments , legions , and " freikorps " volunteer formations from the wars of 1813–1814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line , along with many " landwehr " ( militia ) regiments .
the " landwehr " were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in belgium .
the prussian cavalry were in a similar state .
its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance—guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle .
offsetting these handicaps , the prussian army had excellent and professional leadership in its general staff organisation .
these officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training .
this system was in marked contrast to the conflicting , vague orders issued by the french army .
this staff system ensured that before ligny , three-quarters of the prussian army concentrated for battle with *num* hours notice .
after ligny , the prussian army , although defeated , was able to realign its supply train , reorganise itself , and intervene decisively on the waterloo battlefield within *num* hours .
two and a half prussian army corps , or *num* , *num* men , were engaged at waterloo ; two brigades under bülow , commander of iv corps , attacked lobau at *num* : *num* , while zieten's i corps and parts of pirch i's ii corps engaged at about *num* : *num* .
the waterloo position was a strong one .
it consisted of a long ridge running east-west , perpendicular to , and bisected by , the main road to brussels .
along the crest of the ridge ran the ohain road , a deep sunken lane .
near the crossroads with the brussels road was a large elm tree that was roughly in the centre of wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day .
wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the ohain road .
using the reverse slope , as he had many times previously , wellington concealed his strength from the french , with the exception of his skirmishers and artillery .
the length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at .
this allowed wellington to draw up his forces in depth , which he did in the centre and on the right , all the way towards the village of braine-l'alleud , in the expectation that the prussians would reinforce his left during the day .
in front of the ridge , there were three positions that could be fortified .
on the extreme right were the château , garden , and orchard of hougoumont .
this was a large and well-built country house , initially hidden in trees .
the house faced north along a sunken , covered lane ( usually described by the british as " the hollow-way " ) along which it could be supplied .
on the extreme left was the hamlet of papelotte .
both hougoumont and papelotte were fortified and garrisoned , and thus anchored wellington's flanks securely .
papelotte also commanded the road to wavre that the prussians would use to send reinforcements to wellington's position .
on the western side of the main road , and in front of the rest of wellington's line , was the farmhouse and orchard of la haye sainte , which was garrisoned with *num* light infantry of the king's german legion .
on the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry , where the *ord* rifles were posted as sharpshooters .
wellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force .
any attempt to turn wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched hougoumont position .
any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between enfilading fire from hougoumont and la haye sainte .
on the left , any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from la haye sainte and its adjoining sandpit , and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding papelotte and the other garrisoned buildings on that flank , and some very wet ground in the smohain defile .
the french army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south .
napoleon could not see wellington's positions , so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the brussels road .
on the right was i corps under d'erlon with *num* , *num* infantry and *num* , *num* cavalry , plus a cavalry reserve of *num* , *num* .
on the left was ii corps under reille with *num* , *num* infantry , and *num* , *num* cavalry , and a cavalry reserve of *num* , *num* .
in the centre about the road south of the inn " la belle alliance " were a reserve including lobau's vi corps with *num* , *num* men , the *num* , *num* infantry of the imperial guard , and a cavalry reserve of *num* , *num* .
in the right rear of the french position was the substantial village of plancenoit , and at the extreme right , the " bois de paris " wood .
napoleon initially commanded the battle from rossomme farm , where he could see the entire battlefield , but moved to a position near " la belle alliance " early in the afternoon .
command on the battlefield ( which was largely hidden from his view ) was delegated to ney .
wellington rose at around *num* : *num* or *num* : *num* on *num* june , and wrote letters until dawn .
he had earlier written to blücher confirming that he would give battle at mont-saint-jean if blücher could provide him with at least one corps ; otherwise he would retreat towards brussels .
at a late-night council , blücher's chief of staff , august neidhardt von gneisenau , had been distrustful of wellington's strategy , but blücher persuaded him that they should march to join wellington's army .
in the morning wellington duly received a reply from blücher , promising to support him with three corps .
from *num* : *num* wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces .
at wavre , the prussian iv corps under bülow was designated to lead the march to waterloo as it was in the best shape , not having been involved in the battle of ligny .
although they had not taken casualties , iv corps had been marching for two days , covering the retreat of the three other corps of the prussian army from the battlefield of ligny .
they had been posted farthest away from the battlefield , and progress was very slow .
the roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain , and bülow's men had to pass through the congested streets of wavre and move *num* artillery pieces .
matters were not helped when a fire broke out in wavre , blocking several streets along bülow's intended route .
as a result , the last part of the corps left at *num* : *num* , six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards waterloo .
bülow's men were followed to waterloo first by i corps and then by ii corps .
napoleon breakfasted off silver plate at " le caillou " , the house where he had spent the night .
when soult suggested that grouchy should be recalled to join the main force , napoleon said , " just because you have all been beaten by wellington , you think he's a good general .
i tell you wellington is a bad general , the english are bad troops , and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast " .
napoleon's seemingly dismissive remark may have been strategic , given his maxim " in war , morale is everything " .
he had acted similarly in the past , and on the morning of the battle of waterloo may have been responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals .
later on , being told by his brother , jerome , of some gossip overheard by a waiter between british officers at lunch at the ' king of spain ' inn in genappe that the prussians were to march over from wavre , napoleon declared that the prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by grouchy .
surprisingly , jerome's overheard gossip aside , the french commanders present at the pre-battle conference at " le caillou " had no information about the alarming proximity of the prussians and did not suspect that blücher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later .
napoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground , which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult .
in addition , many of his forces had bivouacked well to the south of " la belle alliance " .
at *num* : *num* , in response to a dispatch he had received from grouchy six hours earlier , he sent a reply telling grouchy to " head for wavre [ to grouchy's north ] in order to draw near to us [ to the west of grouchy ] " and then " push before him " the prussians to arrive at waterloo " as soon as possible " .
at *num* : *num* , napoleon drafted his general order : reille's corps on the left and d'erlon's corps to the right were to attack the village of mont-saint-jean and keep abreast of one another .
this order assumed wellington's battle-line was in the village , rather than at the more forward position on the ridge .
to enable this , jerome's division would make an initial attack on hougoumont , which napoleon expected would draw in wellington's reserves , since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea .
a " grande batterie " of the reserve artillery of i , ii , and vi corps was to then bombard the centre of wellington's position from about *num* : *num* .
d'erlon's corps would then attack wellington's left , break through , and roll up his line from east to west .
in his memoirs , napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate wellington's army from the prussians and drive it back towards the sea .
the historian andrew roberts notes that " it is a curious fact about the battle of waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began " .
wellington recorded in his dispatches that at " about ten o'clock [ napoleon ] commenced a furious attack upon our post at hougoumont " .
other sources state that the attack began around *num* : *num* .
the house and its immediate environs were defended by four light companies of guards , and the wood and park by hanoverian " jäger " and the *num* / *ord* nassau .
the initial attack by bauduin's brigade emptied the wood and park , but was driven back by heavy british artillery fire , and cost bauduin his life .
as the british guns were distracted by a duel with french artillery , a second attack by soye's brigade and what had been bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house .
sous-lieutenant legros , a french officer , broke the gate open with an axe , and some french troops managed to enter the courtyard .
the coldstream guards and the scots guards arrived to support the defence .
there was a fierce melee , and the british managed to close the gate on the french troops streaming in .
the frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed .
only a young drummer boy was spared .
fighting continued around hougoumont all afternoon .
its surroundings were heavily invested by french light infantry , and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind hougoumont .
wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it .
in the afternoon , napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire , resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel .
du plat's brigade of the king's german legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way , which they had to do without senior officers .
eventually they were relieved by the *ord* highlanders , a british infantry regiment .
adam's brigade was further reinforced by hugh halkett's *ord* hanoverian brigade , and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by reille .
hougoumont held out until the end of the battle .
the fighting at hougoumont has often been characterised as a diversionary attack to draw in wellington's reserves which escalated into an all-day battle and drew in french reserves instead .
in fact there is a good case to believe that both napoleon and wellington thought that holding hougoumont was key to winning the battle .
hougoumont was a part of the battlefield that napoleon could see clearly , and he continued to direct resources towards it and its surroundings all afternoon ( *num* battalions in all , *num* , *num* troops ) .
similarly , though the house never contained a large number of troops , wellington devoted *num* battalions ( *num* , *num* troops ) over the course of the afternoon in keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to reach the buildings .
he moved several artillery batteries from his hard-pressed centre to support hougoumont , and later stated that " the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates at hougoumont " .
the *num* guns of napoleon's " grande batterie " drew up in the centre .
these opened fire at *num* : *num* , according to lord hill ( commander of the anglo-allied ii corps ) , while other sources put the time between noon and *num* : *num* .
the " grande batterie " was too far back to aim accurately , and the only other troops they could see were skirmishers of the regiments of kempt and pack , and perponcher's *ord* dutch division ( the others were employing wellington's characteristic " reverse slope defence " ) .
nevertheless , the bombardment caused a large number of casualties .
although some projectiles buried themselves in the soft soil , most found their marks on the reverse slope of the ridge .
the bombardment forced the cavalry of the union brigade ( in third line ) to move to its left , as did the scots greys , to reduce their casualty rate .
at about *num* : *num* , napoleon saw the first columns of prussians around the village of lasne-chapelle-saint-lambert , four or five miles ( six to eight kilometres ) away from his right flank—about three hours march for an army .
napoleon's reaction was to have marshal soult send a message to grouchy telling him to come towards the battlefield and attack the arriving prussians .
grouchy , however , had been executing napoleon's previous orders to follow the prussians " with your sword against his back " towards wavre , and was by then too far away to reach waterloo .
grouchy was advised by his subordinate , gérard , to " march to the sound of the guns " , but stuck to his orders and engaged the prussian iii corps rear guard under the command of lieutenant-general baron johann von thielmann at the battle of wavre .
moreover , soult's letter ordering grouchy to move quickly to join napoleon and attack bülow would not actually reach grouchy until after *num* : *num* .
a little after *num* : *num* , i corps ' attack began in large columns .
bernard cornwell writes " [ column ] suggests an elongated formation with its narrow end aimed like a spear at the enemy line , while in truth it was much more like a brick advancing sideways and d'erlon's assault was made up of four such bricks , each one a division of french infantry " .
each division , with one exception , was drawn up in huge masses , consisting of the eight or nine battalions of which they were formed , deployed , and placed in a column one behind the other , with only five paces interval between the battalions .
the one exception was the *ord* division ( commanded by quiot , the leader of the *ord* brigade ) .
its two brigades were formed in a similar manner , but side by side instead of behind one another .
this was done because , being on the left of the four divisions , it was ordered to send one ( quiot's brigade ) against the south and west of la haye sainte , while the other ( bourgeois ' ) was to attack the eastern side of the same post .
the divisions were to advance in echelon from the left at a distance of *num* paces apart—the *ord* division ( donzelot's ) on the right of bourgeois ' brigade , the *ord* division ( marcognet's ) next , and the *ord* division ( durutte's ) on the right .
they were led by ney to the assault , each column having a front of about a hundred and sixty to two hundred files .
the leftmost division , advanced on la haye sainte .
the farmhouse was defended by the king's german legion .
while one french battalion engaged the defenders from the front , the following battalions fanned out to either side and , with the support of several squadrons of cuirassiers , succeeded in isolating the farmhouse .
the king's german legion resolutely defended the farmhouse .
each time the french tried to scale the walls the outnumbered germans somehow held them off .
the prince of orange saw that la haye sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the hanoverian lüneberg battalion in line .
cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past la haye sainte , almost to the crest of the ridge , where they covered d'erlon's left flank as his attack developed .
at about *num* : *num* , d'erlon started to advance his three other divisions , some *num* , *num* men over a front of about , against wellington's left wing .
at the point they aimed for they faced *num* , *num* men : the first line consisted of the dutch *ord* " brigade van bylandt " of the *ord* dutch division , flanked by the british brigades of kempt and pack on either side .
the second line consisted of british and hanoverian troops under sir thomas picton , who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge .
all had suffered badly at quatre bras .
in addition , the bijlandt brigade had been ordered to deploy its skirmishers in the hollow road and on the forward slope .
the rest of the brigade was lying down just behind the road .
at the moment these skirmishers were rejoining their parent battalions , the brigade was ordered to its feet and started to return fire .
on the left of the brigade , where the *ord* dutch militia stood , a " few files were shot down and an opening in the line thus occurred " .
the battalion had no reserves and was unable to close the gap .
d'erlon's troops pushed through this gap in the line and the remaining battalions in the bylandt brigade ( *ord* dutch militia and belgian *ord* line battalion ) were forced to retreat to the square of the *ord* dutch militia , which was in reserve between picton's troops , about *num* paces to the rear .
there they regrouped under the command of colonel van zuylen van nijevelt .
a moment later the prince of orange ordered a counterattack , which actually occurred around *num* minutes later .
bylandt was wounded and retired off the field , passing command of the brigade to lt .
kol .
de jongh .
d'erlon's men ascended the slope and advanced on the sunken road , " chemin d'ohain " , that ran from behind la haye sainte and continued east .
it was lined on both sides by thick hedges , with bylandt's brigade just across the road while the british brigades had been lying down some *num* yards back from the road , pack's to bylandt's left and kempt's to bylandt's right .
kempt's *num* , *num* men were engaged by bourgeois ' brigade of *num* , *num* men of quiot's division .
in the centre , donzelot's division had pushed back bylandt's brigade .
on the right of the french advance was marcognet's division led by grenier's brigade consisting of the " 45e régiment de ligne " and followed by the " 25e régiment de ligne " , somewhat less than *num* , *num* men , and behind them , nogue's brigade of the " 21e " and " 45e " regiments .
opposing them on the other side of the road was pack's *ord* brigade consisting of three scottish regiments : the royal scots , the *ord* black watch , the *ord* gordons and the *ord* foot totaling something over *num* , *num* men .
a very even fight between british and french infantry was about to occur .
the french advance drove in the british skirmishers and reached the sunken road .
as they did so , pack's men stood up , formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the french cavalry , advanced , and opened fire .
however , a firefight had been anticipated and the french infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation .
now , fully deployed into line , they returned fire and successfully pressed the british troops ; although the attack faltered at the centre , the line in front of d'erlon's right started to crumble .
picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the british and hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers .
pack's regiments , all four ranks deep , advanced to attack the french in the road but faltered and began to fire on the french instead of charging .
the *ord* black watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the british *ord* foot while the leading french " 45e ligne " burst through the hedge cheering .
along the sunken road , the french were forcing the anglo-allies back , the british line was dispersing , and at two o'clock in the afternoon napoleon was winning the battle of waterloo .
reports from baron von muffling , the prussian liaison officer attached to wellington's army , relate that : " after *num* o'clock the duke's situation became critical , unless the succour of the prussian army arrived soon " .
at this crucial juncture , uxbridge ordered his two brigades of british heavy cavalry—formed unseen behind the ridge—to charge in support of the hard-pressed infantry .
the *ord* brigade , known as the household brigade , commanded by major-general lord edward somerset , consisted of guards regiments : the *ord* and *ord* life guards , the royal horse guards ( the blues ) , and the *ord* ( king's ) dragoon guards .
the *ord* brigade , also known as the union brigade , commanded by major-general sir william ponsonby , was so called as it consisted of an english , the *ord* ( the royals ) ; a scottish , *ord* ( ' scots greys ' ) ; and an irish , *ord* ( inniskilling ) ; regiment of heavy dragoons .
more than *num* years of warfare had eroded the numbers of suitable cavalry mounts available on the european continent ; this resulted in the british heavy cavalry entering the *num* campaign with the finest horses of any contemporary cavalry arm .
british cavalry troopers also received excellent mounted swordsmanship training .
they were , however , inferior to the french in manoeuvring in large formations , cavalier in attitude , and unlike the infantry some units had scant experience of warfare .
the scots greys , for example , had not been in action since *num* .
according to wellington , though they were superior individual horsemen , they were inflexible and lacked tactical ability .
" i considered one squadron a match for two french , i didn't like to see four british opposed to four french : and as the numbers increased and order , of course , became more necessary i was the more unwilling to risk our men without having a superiority in numbers " .
the two brigades had a combined field strength of about *num* , *num* ( *num* , *num* official strength ) ; they charged with the 47-year-old uxbridge leading them and a very inadequate number of squadrons held in reserve .
there is evidence that uxbridge gave an order , the morning of the battle , to all cavalry brigade commanders to commit their commands on their own initiative , as direct orders from himself might not always be forthcoming , and to " support movements to their front " .
it appears that uxbridge expected the brigades of sir john ormsby vandeleur , hussey vivian and the dutch cavalry to provide support to the british heavies .
uxbridge later regretted leading the charge in person , saying " i committed a great mistake " , when he should have been organising an adequate reserve to move forward in support .
the household brigade crossed the crest of the anglo-allied position and charged downhill .
the cuirassiers guarding d'erlon's left flank were still dispersed , and so were swept over the deeply sunken main road and then routed .
continuing their attack , the squadrons on the left of the household brigade then destroyed aulard's brigade .
despite attempts to recall them , they continued past la haye sainte and found themselves at the bottom of the hill on blown horses facing schmitz's brigade formed in squares .
to their left , the union brigade suddenly swept through the infantry lines , giving rise to the legend that some of the *ord* gordon highland regiment clung onto their stirrups and accompanied them into the charge .
from the centre leftwards , the royal dragoons destroyed bourgeois ' brigade , capturing the eagle of the *ord* " ligne " .
the inniskillings routed the other brigade of quoit's division , and the scots greys came upon the lead french regiment , *ord* " ligne " , as it was still reforming after having crossed the sunken road and broken through the hedge row in pursuit of the british infantry .
the greys captured the eagle of the *ord* " ligne " and overwhelmed grenier's brigade .
these would be the only two french eagles captured by the british during the battle .
on wellington's extreme left , durutte's division had time to form squares and fend off groups of greys .
as with the household cavalry , the officers of the royals and inniskillings found it very difficult to rein back their troops , who lost all cohesion .
having taken casualties , and still trying to reorder themselves , the scots greys and the rest of the union brigade found themselves before the main french lines .
their horses were blown , and they were still in disorder without any idea of what their next collective objective was .
some attacked nearby gun batteries of the grande battery .
napoleon promptly responded by ordering a counter-attack by the cuirassier brigades of farine and travers and jaquinot's two chevau-léger ( lancer ) regiments in the i corps light cavalry division .
disorganized and milling about the bottom of the valley between hougoumont and la belle alliance , the scots greys and the rest of the british heavy cavalry were taken by surprise by the countercharge of milhaud's cuirassiers , joined by lancers from baron jaquinot's *ord* cavalry division .
as ponsonby tried to rally his men against the french cuirassers , he was attacked by jaquinot's lancers and captured .
a nearby party of scots greys saw the capture and attempted to rescue their brigade commander .
however , the french lancer who had captured ponsonby killed him and then used his lance to kill three of the scots greys who had attempted the rescue .
by the time ponsonby died , the momentum had entirely returned in favour of the french .
milhaud's and jaquinot's cavalrymen drove the union brigade from the valley .
the result was very heavy losses for the british cavalry .
a countercharge , by british light dragoons under major-general vandeleur and dutch–belgian light dragoons and hussars under major-general ghigny on the left wing , and dutch–belgian " carabiniers " under major-general trip in the centre , repelled the french cavalry .
all figures quoted for the losses of the cavalry brigades as a result of this charge are estimates , as casualties were only noted down after the day of the battle and were for the battle as a whole .
some historians , barbero for example , believe the official rolls tend to overestimate the number of cavalrymen present in their squadrons on the field of battle and that the proportionate losses were , as a result , considerably higher than the numbers on paper might suggest .
the union brigade lost heavily in both officers and men killed ( including its commander , william ponsonby , and colonel hamilton of the scots greys ) and wounded .
the *ord* life guards and the king's dragoon guards of the household brigade also lost heavily ( with colonel fuller , commander of the king's dg , killed ) .
however , the *ord* life guards , on the extreme right of the charge , and the blues , who formed a reserve , had kept their cohesion and consequently suffered significantly fewer casualties .
on the rolls the official , or paper strength , for both brigades is given as *num* , *num* while barbero and others estimate the actual strength at around *num* , *num* and the official recorded losses for the two heavy cavalry brigades during the battle was *num* , *num* troopers and *num* , *num* horses .
some historians , such as chandler and weller , assert that the british heavy cavalry were destroyed as a viable force following their first , epic charge .
barbero states that the scots greys were practically wiped out and that the other two regiments of the union brigade suffered comparable losses .
other historians , such as clark-kennedy and wood , citing british eyewitness accounts , describe the continuing role of the heavy cavalry after their charge .
the heavy brigades , far from being ineffective , continued to provide valuable services .
they countercharged french cavalry numerous times ( both brigades ) , halted a combined cavalry and infantry attack ( household brigade only ) , were used to bolster the morale of those units in their vicinity at times of crisis , and filled gaps in the anglo-allied line caused by high casualties in infantry formations ( both brigades ) .
this service was rendered at a very high cost , as close combat with french cavalry , carbine fire , infantry musketry and—more deadly than all of these—artillery fire steadily eroded the number of effectives in the two brigades .
at *num* o'clock in the afternoon the whole union brigade could field only *num* squadrons , though these countercharged french cavalry , losing half their number in the process .
at the end of the fighting the two brigades , by this time combined , could muster one squadron .
*num* , *num* french troops of d'erlon's i corps had been committed to this attack .
the i corps had been driven in rout back across the valley costing napoleon *num* , *num* casualties including over *num* , *num* prisoners taken .
also some valuable time was lost , the charge had dispersed numerous units and it would take until *num* : *num* hours for d'erlon's shaken corps to reform .
and although elements of the prussians now began to appear on the field to his right , napoleon had already ordered lobau's vi corps to move to the right flank to hold them back before d'erlon's attack began .
a little before *num* : *num* , ney noted an apparent exodus from wellington's centre .
he mistook the movement of casualties to the rear for the beginnings of a retreat , and sought to exploit it .
following the defeat of d'erlon's corps , ney had few infantry reserves left , as most of the infantry had been committed either to the futile hougoumont attack or to the defence of the french right .
ney therefore tried to break wellington's centre with cavalry alone .
initially milhaud's reserve cavalry corps of cuirassiers and lefebvre-desnoëttes ' light cavalry division of the imperial guard , some *num* , *num* sabres , were committed .
when these were repulsed , kellermann's heavy cavalry corps and guyot's heavy cavalry of the guard were added to the massed assault , a total of around *num* , *num* cavalry in *num* squadrons .
when napoleon saw the charge he said it was an hour too soon .
wellington's infantry responded by forming squares ( hollow box-formations four ranks deep ) .
squares were much smaller than usually depicted in paintings of the battle—a 500-man battalion square would have been no more than in length on a side .
squares that stood their ground were deadly to cavalry , as cavalry could not engage with soldiers behind a hedge of bayonets , but were themselves vulnerable to fire from the squares .
horses would not charge a square , nor could they be outflanked , but they were vulnerable to artillery or infantry .
wellington ordered his artillery crews to take shelter within the squares as the cavalry approached , and to return to their guns and resume fire as they retreated .
witnesses in the british infantry recorded as many as *num* assaults , though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack ; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer .
kellermann , recognising the futility of the attacks , tried to reserve the elite " carabinier " brigade from joining in , but eventually ney spotted them and insisted on their involvement .
a british eyewitness of the first french cavalry attack , an officer in the foot guards , recorded his impressions very lucidly and somewhat poetically : in essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect .
close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate ; at waterloo , however , co-operation between the french cavalry and artillery was not impressive .
the french artillery did not get close enough to the anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive .
artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties , but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect , at targets beyond the ridge .
if infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations , and were not panicked , cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them .
the french cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares , the harrying fire of british artillery as the french cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup , and the decisive countercharges of wellington's light cavalry regiments , the dutch heavy cavalry brigade , and the remaining effectives of the household cavalry .
at least one artillery officer disobeyed wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges .
captain mercer , who commanded ' g ' troop , royal horse artillery , thought the brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout , to great effect .
for reasons that remain unclear , no attempt was made to spike other anglo-allied guns while they were in french possession .
in line with wellington's orders , gunners were able to return to their pieces and fire into the french cavalry as they withdrew after each attack .
after numerous costly but fruitless attacks on the mont-saint-jean ridge , the french cavalry was spent .
their casualties cannot easily be estimated .
senior french cavalry officers , in particular the generals , experienced heavy losses .
four divisional commanders were wounded , nine brigadiers wounded , and one killed—testament to their courage and their habit of leading from the front .
illustratively , houssaye reports that the " grenadiers à cheval " numbered *num* of all ranks on *num* june , but just *num* on *num* june , while the empress dragoons lost *num* of *num* over the same period .
overall guyot's guard heavy cavalry division lost *num* % of its strength .
eventually it became obvious , even to ney , that cavalry alone were achieving little .
belatedly , he organised a combined-arms attack , using bachelu's division and tissot's regiment of foy's division from reille's ii corps ( about *num* , *num* infantrymen ) plus those french cavalry that remained in a fit state to fight .
this assault was directed along much the same route as the previous heavy cavalry attacks ( between hougoumont and la haye sainte ) .
it was halted by a charge of the household brigade cavalry led by uxbridge .
the british cavalry were unable , however , to break the french infantry , and fell back with losses from musketry fire .
uxbridge recorded that he tried to lead the dutch carabiniers , under major-general trip , to renew the attack and that they refused to follow him .
other members of the british cavalry staff also commented on this occurrence .
however , there is no support for this incident in dutch or belgian sources .
meanwhile , bachelu's and tissot's men and their cavalry supports were being hard hit by fire from artillery and from adam's infantry brigade , and they eventually fell back .
although the french cavalry caused few direct casualties to wellington's centre , artillery fire onto his infantry squares caused many .
wellington's cavalry , except for sir john vandeleur's and sir hussey vivian's brigades on the far left , had all been committed to the fight , and had taken significant losses .
the situation appeared so desperate that the cumberland hussars , the only hanoverian cavalry regiment present , fled the field spreading alarm all the way to brussels .
at approximately the same time as ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of wellington's line , rallied elements of d'erlon's i corps , spearheaded by the *ord* " légère , " renewed the attack on la haye sainte and this time were successful , partly because the king's german legion's ammunition ran out .
however , the germans had held the centre of the battlefield for almost the entire day , and this had stalled the french advance .
with la haye sainte captured , ney then moved skirmishers and horse artillery up towards wellington's centre .
french artillery began to pulverise the infantry squares at short range with canister .
the *ord* and *ord* regiments suffered such heavy losses that they had to combine to form a viable square .
the success napoleon needed to continue his offensive had occurred .
ney was on the verge of breaking the anglo-allied centre .
along with this artillery fire a multitude of french " tirailleurs " occupied the dominant positions behind la haye sainte and poured an effective fire into the squares .
the situation for the anglo-allies was now so dire that the *ord* regiment's colours and all of halkett's brigade's colours were sent to the rear for safety , described by historian alessandro barbero as , " .
.
.
a measure that was without precedent " .
wellington , noticing the slackening of fire from la haye sainte , with his staff rode closer to it .
french skirmishers appeared around the building and fired on the british command as it struggled to get away through the hedgerow along the road .
the prince of orange then ordered a single battalion of the kgl , the fifth , to recapture the farm despite the obvious presence of enemy cavalry .
their colonel , christian friedrich wilhelm von ompteda obeyed and led the battalion down the slope , chasing off some french skirmishers until french cuirassiers fell on his open flank , killed him , destroyed his battalion and took its colour .
a dutch–belgian cavalry regiment ordered to charge , retreated from the field instead , fired on by their own infantry .
merlen's light cavalry brigade charged the french artillery taking position near la haye sainte but were shot to pieces and the brigade fell apart .
the netherlands cavalry division , wellington's last cavalry reserve behind the centre having lost half their strength was now useless and the french cavalry , despite its losses , were masters of the field compelling the anglo-allied infantry to remain in square .
more and more french artillery was brought forward .
a french battery advanced to within *num* yards of the *num* / *ord* nassau square causing heavy casualties .
when the nassauers attempted to attack the battery they were ridden down by a squadron of cuirassiers .
yet another battery deployed on the flank of mercer's battery and shot up its horses and limbers and pushed mercer back .
mercer later recalled , " the rapidity and precision of this fire was quite appalling .
every shot almost took effect , and i certainly expected we should all be annihilated .
.
.
.
the saddle-bags , in many instances were torn from horses ' backs .
.
.
one shell i saw explode under the two finest wheel-horses in the troop down they dropped " .
french " tirailleurs " occupied the dominant positions , especially one on a knoll overlooking the square of the *ord* .
unable to break square to drive off the french infantry because of the presence of french cavalry and artillery , the *ord* had to remain in that formation and endure the fire of the " tirailleurs " .
that fire nearly annihilated the *ord* foot , the inniskillings , who lost two-thirds of their strength within that three or four hours .
during this time many of wellington's generals and aides were killed or wounded including somerset , canning , de lancey , alten and cooke .
the situation was now critical and wellington , trapped in an infantry square and ignorant of events beyond it , was desperate for the arrival of help from the prussians .
he later wrote , the first prussian corps to arrive in strength was bülow's iv corps .
bülow's objective was plancenoit , which the prussians intended to use as a springboard into the rear of the french positions .
blücher intended to secure his right upon the châteaux frichermont using the bois de paris road .
blücher and wellington had been exchanging communications since *num* : *num* and had agreed to this advance on frichermont if wellington's centre was under attack .
general bülow noted that the way to plancenoit lay open and that the time was *num* : *num* .
at about this time , the *ord* brigade iv corps was sent to link up with the nassauers of wellington's left flank in the frichermont-la haie area , with the brigade's horse artillery battery and additional brigade artillery deployed to its left in support .
napoleon sent lobau's corps to stop the rest of bülow's iv corps proceeding to plancenoit .
the *ord* brigade threw lobau's troops out of frichermont with a determined bayonet charge , then proceeded up the frichermont heights , battering french chasseurs with 12-pounder artillery fire , and pushed on to plancenoit .
this sent lobau's corps into retreat to the plancenoit area , driving lobau past the rear of the " armee du nord's " right flank and directly threatening its only line of retreat .
hiller's *ord* brigade also pushed forward with six battalions against plancenoit .
napoleon had dispatched all eight battalions of the young guard to reinforce lobau , who was now seriously pressed .
the young guard counter-attacked and , after very hard fighting , secured plancenoit , but were themselves counter-attacked and driven out .
napoleon sent two battalions of the middle / old guard into plancenoit and after ferocious bayonet fighting—they did not deign to fire their muskets—this force recaptured the village .
throughout the late afternoon , zieten's i corps had been arriving in greater strength in the area just north of la haie .
general müffling , prussian liaison to wellington , rode to meet i corps .
zieten had by this time brought up his *ord* brigade , but had become concerned at the sight of stragglers and casualties from the nassau units on wellington's left and from the prussian *ord* brigade .
these troops appeared to be withdrawing and zieten , fearing that his own troops would be caught up in a general retreat , was starting to move away from wellington's flank and towards the prussian main body near plancenoit .
zieten had also received a direct order from blücher to support bülow , which zieten obeyed and marched to bülow's aid .
müffling saw this movement away and persuaded zieten to support wellington's left flank .
müffling warned zieten that " the battle is lost if the corps does not keep on the move and immediately support the english army " .
zieten resumed his march to support wellington directly , and the arrival of his troops allowed wellington to reinforce his crumbling centre by moving cavalry from his left .
the french were expecting grouchy to march to their support from wavre , and when zieten's i corps appeared at waterloo instead of grouchy , " the shock of disillusionment shattered french morale " and " the sight of zieten's arrival caused turmoil to rage in napoleon's army " .
i corps proceeded to attack the french troops before papelotte and by *num* : *num* the french position was bent into a rough horseshoe shape .
the ends of the line were now based on hougoumont on the left , plancenoit on the right , and the centre on la haie .
durutte had taken the positions of la haie and papelotte in a series of attacks , but now retreated behind smohain without opposing the prussian *ord* regiment as it retook both .
the *ord* advanced against the new french position , was repulsed , and returned to the attack supported by silesian " schützen " ( riflemen ) and the f / *ord* " landwehr " .
the french initially fell back before the renewed assault , but now began seriously to contest ground , attempting to regain smohain and hold on to the ridgeline and the last few houses of papelotte .
the *ord* regiment linked up with a highlander battalion on its far right and along with the *ord* " landwehr " regiment and cavalry support threw the french out of these positions .
further attacks by the *ord* " landwehr " and the *ord* brigade drove the french from frichermont .
durutte's division , finding itself about to be charged by massed squadrons of zieten's i corps cavalry reserve , retreated from the battlefield .
the soldiers of d'erlon's corps alongside this attack on durutte's division also broke and fled in panic , while to the west the french middle guard were assaulting wellington's centre .
the prussian i corps then advanced towards the brussels road and the only line of retreat available to the french .
meanwhile , with wellington's centre exposed by the fall of la haye sainte and the plancenoit front temporarily stabilised , napoleon committed his last reserve , the hitherto-undefeated imperial guard infantry .
this attack , mounted at around *num* : *num* , was intended to break through wellington's centre and roll up his line away from the prussians .
although it is one of the most celebrated passages of arms in military history , it had been unclear which units actually participated .
it appears that it was mounted by five battalions of the middle guard , and not by the grenadiers or chasseurs of the old guard .
three old guard battalions did move forward and formed the attack's second line , though they remained in reserve and did not directly assault the anglo-allied line .
napoleon himself oversaw the initial deployment of the middle and old guard .
the middle guard formed in battalion squares , each about *num* men strong , with the *ord* / *ord* grenadiers , led by generals friant and poret de morvan , on the right along the road , to their left and rear was general harlet leading the square of the *ord* grenadiers , then the *ord* / *ord* chasseurs under general michel , next the *ord* / *ord* chasseurs and finally the large single square of two battalions of *num* soldiers of the *ord* chasseurs led by general henrion .
two batteries of imperial guard horse artillery accompanied them with sections of two guns between the squares .
each square was led by a general and marshal ney , mounted on his *ord* horse of the day , led the advance .
behind them , in reserve , were the three battalions of the old guard , right to left *ord* / *ord* grenadiers , *ord* / *ord* chasseurs and *ord* / *ord* chasseurs .
napoleon left ney to conduct the assault , however ney led the middle guard on an oblique towards the anglo-allied centre right instead of attacking straight up the centre .
napoleon sent ney's senior adc colonel crabbé to order ney to adjust , but crabbé was unable to get there in time .
other troops rallied to support the advance of the guard .
on the left infantry from reille's corps that was not engaged with hougoumont and cavalry advanced .
on the right all the now rallied elements of d'érlon's corps once again ascended the ridge and engaged the anglo-allied line .
of these , pégot's brigade broke into skirmish order and moved north and west of la haye sainte and provided fire support to ney , once again unhorsed , and friant's *ord* / *ord* grenadiers .
the guards first received fire from some brunswick battalions , but the return fire of the grenadiers forced them to retire .
next , colin halket's brigade front line consisting of the *ord* foot and *ord* traded fire but they were driven back in confusion into the *ord* and *ord* regiments , halket was shot in the face and seriously wounded and the whole brigade retreated in a mob .
other anglo-allied troops began to give way as well .
a counterattack by the nassauers and the remains of kielmansegge's brigade from the anglo-allied second line , led by the prince of orange , was also thrown back and the prince of orange was seriously wounded .
general harlet brought up the *ord* grenadiers and the anglo-allied centre was now in serious danger of breaking .
it was at this moment that the timely arrival of the dutch general chassé turned the tide in favour of the anglo-allied army .
chassé's relatively fresh dutch division was sent against them , led by a battery of dutch horse-artillery commanded by captain krahmer de bichin .
the battery opened a destructive fire into the *ord* / *ord* grenadiers ' flank .
this still did not stop the guard's advance , so chassé ordered his first brigade , commanded by colonel hendrik detmers , to charge the outnumbered french with the bayonet ; the french grenadiers then faltered and broke .
the *ord* grenadiers , seeing their comrades retreat and having suffered heavy casualties themselves , now wheeled right about and retired .
to the left of the *ord* grenadiers were the two squares of the *ord* / and *ord* / *ord* chasseurs who angled further to the west and had suffered more from artillery fire than the grenadiers .
but as their advance mounted the ridge they found it apparently abandoned and covered with dead .
suddenly *num* , *num* british foot guards under maitland who had been lying down to protect themselves from the french artillery rose and devastated them with point-blank volleys .
the chasseurs deployed to answer the fire , but some *num* fell from the first volley , including colonel mallet and general michel , and both battalion commanders .
a bayonet charge by the foot guards then broke the leaderless squares , which fell back onto the following column .
the *ord* chasseurs battalion , *num* strong , now came up onto the exposed battalions of british foot guards , who lost all cohesion and dashed back up the slope as a disorganized crowd with the chasseurs in pursuit .
at the crest the chasseurs came upon the battery that had caused severe casualties on the *ord* and *ord* / *ord* chasseurs .
they opened fire and swept away the gunners .
the left flank of their square now came under fire from a heavy formation of british skirmishers , which the chasseurs drove back .
but the skirmishers were replaced by the *ord* light infantry , led by john colborne , which wheeled in line onto the chasseurs ' flank and poured a devastating fire into them .
the chasseurs returned a very sharp fire which killed or wounded some *num* men of the *ord* .
the *ord* then charged , and under this onslaught , the chasseurs broke .
the last of the guard retreated headlong .
a ripple of panic passed through the french lines as the astounding news spread : " "la garde recule .
sauve qui peut " ! " ( " the guard is retreating .
every man for himself ! " ) wellington now stood up in copenhagen's stirrups and waved his hat in the air to signal a general advance .
his army rushed forward from the lines and threw themselves upon the retreating french .
the surviving imperial guard rallied on their three reserve battalions ( some sources say four ) just south of la haye sainte for a last stand .
a charge from adam's brigade and the hanoverian " landwehr " osnabrück battalion , plus vivian's and vandeleur's relatively fresh cavalry brigades to their right , threw them into confusion .
those left in semi-cohesive units retreated towards " la belle alliance " .
it was during this retreat that some of the guards were invited to surrender , eliciting the famous , if apocryphal , retort " "la garde meurt , elle ne se rend pas ! " " ( " the guard dies , it does not surrender ! " ) at about the same time , the prussian *ord* , *ord* , and *ord* brigades were starting to push through plancenoit , in the third assault of the day .
the church was by now on fire , while its graveyard—the french centre of resistance—had corpses strewn about " as if by a whirlwind " .
five guard battalions were deployed in support of the young guard , virtually all of which was now committed to the defence , along with remnants of lobau's corps .
the key to the plancenoit position proved to be the chantelet woods to the south .
pirch's ii corps had arrived with two brigades and reinforced the attack of iv corps , advancing through the woods .
the *ord* regiment's musketeer battalions threw the *num* / 2e grenadiers ( old guard ) out of the chantelet woods , outflanking plancenoit and forcing a retreat .
the old guard retreated in good order until they met the mass of troops retreating in panic , and became part of that rout .
the prussian iv corps advanced beyond plancenoit to find masses of french retreating in disorder from british pursuit .
the prussians were unable to fire for fear of hitting wellington's units .
this was the fifth and final time that plancenoit changed hands .
french forces not retreating with the guard were surrounded in their positions and eliminated , neither side asking for nor offering quarter .
the french young guard division reported *num* per cent casualties , and two-thirds of lobau's corps ceased to exist .
the french right , left , and centre had all now failed .
the last cohesive french force consisted of two battalions of the old guard stationed around " la belle alliance " ; they had been so placed to act as a final reserve and to protect napoleon in the event of a french retreat .
he hoped to rally the french army behind them , but as retreat turned into rout , they too were forced to withdraw , one on either side of " la belle alliance " , in square as protection against coalition cavalry .
until persuaded that the battle was lost and he should leave , napoleon commanded the square to the left of the inn .
adam's brigade charged and forced back this square , while the prussians engaged the other .
as dusk fell , both squares withdrew in relatively good order , but the french artillery and everything else fell into the hands of the prussian and anglo-allied armies .
the retreating guards were surrounded by thousands of fleeing , broken french troops .
coalition cavalry harried the fugitives until about *num* : *num* , with gneisenau pursuing them as far as genappe before ordering a halt .
there , napoleon's abandoned carriage was captured , still containing of machiavelli's " the prince " , and diamonds left behind in the rush to escape .
these diamonds became part of king friedrich wilhelm of prussia's crown jewels ; one major keller of the f / *ord* received the pour le mérite with oak leaves for the feat .
by this time *num* guns and *num* , *num* prisoners had also been taken , including more generals .
other sources agree that the meeting of the commanders took place near " la belle alliance " , with this occurring at around *num* : *num* .
waterloo cost wellington around *num* , *num* dead or wounded and blücher some *num* , *num* ( *num* of which were suffered by just one unit : the *ord* regiment , which served in bülow's *ord* brigade , had fought at both frichermont and plancenoit , and won *num* iron crosses ) .
napoleon's losses were *num* , *num* to *num* , *num* killed or wounded and included *num* , *num* to *num* , *num* captured with an additional *num* , *num* deserting subsequent to the battle and over the following days .
at *num* : *num* on *num* june general grouchy , still following his orders , defeated general thielemann at wavre and withdrew in good order—though at the cost of *num* , *num* french troops that never reached the waterloo battlefield .
wellington sent describing the battle to england on *num* june *num* ; it arrived in london on *num* june *num* and was published as a " london gazette extraordinary " on *num* june .
wellington , blücher and other coalition forces advanced upon paris .
napoleon announced his second abdication on *num* june *num* .
in the final skirmish of the napoleonic wars , marshal davout , napoleon's minister of war , was defeated by blücher at issy on *num* july *num* .
allegedly , napoleon tried to escape to north america , but the royal navy was blockading french ports to forestall such a move .
he finally surrendered to captain frederick maitland of hms " bellerophon " on *num* july .
there was a campaign against french fortresses that still held out ; longwy capitulated on *num* september *num* , the last to do so .
louis xviii was restored to the throne of france and napoleon was exiled to saint helena , where he died in *num* .
the treaty of paris was signed on *num* november *num* .
maitland's *ord* foot guards , who had defeated the chasseurs of the guard , were thought to have defeated the grenadiers , although they had only faced chasseurs of the newly raised middle guard .
they were nevertheless awarded the title of grenadier guards in recognition of their feat and adopted bearskins in the style of the grenadiers .
britain's household cavalry likewise adopted the cuirass in *num* in recognition of their success against their armoured french counterparts .
the effectiveness of the lance was noted by all participants and this weapon subsequently became more widespread throughout europe ; the british converted their first light cavalry regiment to lancers in *num* , their uniforms , of polish origin , were based on those of the imperial guard lancers .
teeth of tens of thousands of dead soldiers were removed by surviving troops , locals or even scavengers who had travelled there from britain , then used for making denture replacements in britain and elsewhere .
waterloo proved a decisive battle in more than one sense .
every generation in europe up to the outbreak of the first world war looked back at waterloo as the turning point that dictated the course of subsequent world history , seeing it in retrospect as the event that ushered in the concert of europe , an era characterised by relative peace , material prosperity and technological progress .
the battle definitively ended the series of wars that had convulsed europe , and involved many other regions of the world , since the french revolution of the early 1790s .
it also ended the first french empire and the political and military career of napoleon bonaparte , one of the greatest commanders and statesmen in history .
there followed almost four decades of international peace in europe .
no further major conflict occurred until the crimean war of 1853-1856 .
changes to the configuration of european states , as refashioned after waterloo , included the formation of the holy alliance of reactionary governments intent on repressing revolutionary and democratic ideas , and the reshaping of the former holy roman empire into a german confederation increasingly marked by the political dominance of prussia .
the bicentenary of waterloo prompted renewed attention to the geopolitical and economic legacy of the battle and to the century of relative transatlantic peace which followed .
general antoine-henri , baron jomini , one of the leading military writers on the napoleonic art of war , had a number of very cogent explanations of the reasons behind napoleon's defeat at waterloo .
the prussian soldier , historian , and theorist carl von clausewitz , who as a young colonel had served as chief-of-staff to thielmann's prussian iii corps during the waterloo campaign , expressed the following opinion : wellington himself wrote in back to london : despite their differences on other matters , discussed at length in carl von clausewitz's study of the " campaign of *num* " and " wellington's famous *num* essay " in reply to it , the prussian clausewitz agreed with wellington on this assessment .
indeed , clausewitz viewed the battle prior to the prussian intervention more as a mutually exhausting stalemate than as an impending french victory , with the advantage , if any , leaning towards wellington .
an alternative view is that towards the end of the battle wellington's anglo-allied army faced imminent defeat without prussian help .
for example , parkinson ( *num* ) writes : " neither army beat napoleon alone .
but whatever the part played by prussian troops in the actual moment when the imperial guard was repulsed , it is difficult to see how wellington could have staved off defeat , when his centre had been almost shattered , his reserves were almost all committed , the french right remained unmolested and the imperial guard intact .
.
.
.
blücher may not have been totally responsible for victory over napoleon , but he deserved full credit for preventing a british defeat " .
steele ( *num* ) writes : " blücher's arrival not only diverted vital reinforcements , but also forced napoleon to accelerate his effort against wellington .
the tide of battle had been turned by the hard-driving blücher .
as his prussians pushed in napoleon's flank .
wellington was able to shift to the offensive " .
some portions of the terrain on the battlefield have been altered from their *num* appearance .
tourism began the day after the battle , with captain mercer noting that on *num* june " a carriage drove on the ground from brussels , the inmates of which , alighting , proceeded to examine the field " .
in *num* , the netherlands ' king william i ordered the construction of a monument .
the lion's mound , a giant artificial hill , was constructed here using of earth taken from the ridge at the centre of the british line , effectively removing the southern bank of wellington's sunken road .
the alleged remark by wellington about the alteration of the battlefield as described by hugo was never documented , however .
other terrain features and notable landmarks on the field have remained virtually unchanged since the battle .
these include the rolling farmland to the east of the brussels–charleroi road as well as the buildings at hougoumont , la haye sainte , and la belle alliance .
apart from the lion mound , there are several more conventional but noteworthy monuments throughout the battlefield .
a cluster of monuments at the brussels–charleroi and braine l'alleud–ohain crossroads marks the mass graves of british , dutch , hanoverian and king's german legion troops .
a monument to the french dead , entitled " l'aigle blessé " ( " the wounded eagle " ) , marks the location where it is believed one of the imperial guard units formed a square during the closing moments of the battle .
a monument to the prussian dead is located in the village of plancenoit on the site where one of their artillery batteries took position .
the duhesme mausoleum is one among the few graves of the fallen .
it is located at the side of saint martin's church in ways , a hamlet in the municipality of genappe .
seventeen fallen officers are buried in the crypt of the british monument in the brussels cemetery in evere .
the remains of a 23-year-old soldier named friederich brandt were discovered in *num* .
he was a slightly hunchbacked infantryman , tall , and was hit in the chest by a french bullet .
his rifle , coins , and position on the battlefield identified him as an hanoverian fighting in the king's german legion .
as part of the bicentennial celebration of the battle , in *num* belgium minted a *num* euro coin depicting the lion monument over a map of the field of battle .
france officially protested against this issue of coins , while the belgian government noted that the french mint sells souvenir medals at waterloo .
after *num* , *num* coins were minted but not released , the issue was melted .
instead , belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of *num* euros .
legally only valid within the issuing country ( but unlikely to circulate ) it was minted in brass , packaged , and sold by the belgian mint for *num* euros .
a *num* euro coin , showing wellington , blücher , their troops and the silhouette of napoleon , was also available in silver for *num* euros .
conciliation conciliation is an alternative dispute resolution ( adr ) process whereby the parties to a dispute use a conciliator , who meets with the parties both separately and together in an attempt to resolve their differences .
they do this by lowering tensions , improving communications , interpreting issues , encouraging parties to explore potential solutions and assisting parties in finding a mutually acceptable outcome .
conciliation differs from arbitration in that the conciliation process , in and of itself , has no legal standing , and the conciliator usually has no authority to seek evidence or call witnesses , usually writes no decision , and makes no award .
conciliation differs from mediation in that in conciliation , often the parties are in need of restoring or repairing a relationship , either personal or business .
a conciliator assists each of the parties to independently develop a list of all of their objectives ( the outcomes which they desire to obtain from the conciliation ) .
the conciliator then has each of the parties separately prioritize their own list from most to least important .
he / she then goes back and forth between the parties and encourages them to " give " on the objectives one at a time , starting with the least important and working toward the most important for each party in turn .
the parties rarely place the same priorities on all objectives , and usually have some objectives that are not listed by the other party .
thus the conciliator can quickly build a string of successes and help the parties create an atmosphere of trust which the conciliator can continue to develop .
most successful conciliators are highly skilled negotiators .
some conciliators operate under the auspices of any one of several non-governmental entities , and for governmental agencies such as the federal mediation and conciliation service in the united states .
historical conciliation is an applied conflict resolution approach that utilizes historical narratives to positively transform relations between societies in conflicts .
historical conciliation can utilize many different methodologies , including mediation , sustained dialogues , apologies , acknowledgement , support of public commemoration activities , and public diplomacy .
historical conciliation is not an excavation of objective facts .
the point of facilitating historical questions is not to discover all the facts in regard to who was right or wrong .
rather , the objective is to discover the complexity , ambiguity , and emotions surrounding both dominant and non-dominant cultural and individual narratives of history .
it is also not a rewriting of history .
the goal is not to create a combined narrative that everyone agrees upon .
instead , the aim is to create room for critical thinking and more inclusive understanding of the past and conceptions of “the other .
” conflicts that are addressed through historical conciliation have their roots in conflicting identities of the people involved .
whether the identity at stake is their ethnicity , religion or culture , it requires a comprehensive approach that takes people’s needs , hopes , fears , and concerns into account .
japanese law makes extensive use of in civil disputes .
the most common forms are civil conciliation and domestic conciliation , both of which are managed under the auspice of the court system by one judge and two non-judge " conciliators .
" civil conciliation is a form of dispute resolution for small lawsuits , and provides a simpler and cheaper alternative to litigation .
depending on the nature of the case , non-judge experts ( doctors , appraisers , actuaries , and so on ) may be called by the court as conciliators to help decide the case .
domestic conciliation is most commonly used to handle contentious divorces , but may apply to other domestic disputes such as the annulment of a marriage or acknowledgment of paternity .
parties in such cases are required to undergo conciliation proceedings and may only bring their case to court once conciliation has failed .
fiji fiji ( ; ; fiji hindi : फ़िजी ) , officially the republic of fiji ( ; fiji hindi : फ़िजी गणराज्य ) , is an island country in melanesia , part of oceania in the south pacific ocean about northeast of new zealand's north island .
its closest neighbours are vanuatu to the west , new caledonia to the southwest , new zealand's kermadec islands to the southeast , tonga to the east , the samoas and france's wallis and futuna to the northeast , and tuvalu to the north .
fiji consists of an archipelago of more than *num* islands—of which *num* are permanently inhabited—and more than *num* islets , amounting to a total land area of about .
the most outlying island is ono-i-lau .
the two major islands , viti levu and vanua levu , account for *num* % of the total population of .
the capital , suva , on viti levu , serves as the country's principal cruise-ship port .
about three-quarters of fijians live on viti levu's coasts , either in suva or in smaller urban centres such as nadi—where tourism is the major local industry—or lautoka , where the sugar-cane industry is paramount .
due to its terrain , the interior of viti levu is sparsely inhabited .
the majority of fiji's islands formed through volcanic activity starting around *num* million years ago .
some geothermal activity still occurs today , on the islands of vanua levu and taveuni .
the geothermal systems on viti levu are non-volcanic in origin , with low-temperature ( c .
35–60 degrees celsius ) surface discharges .
sabeto hot springs near nadi is a good example .
humans have lived in fiji since the second millennium bc—first austronesians and later melanesians , with some polynesian influences .
europeans visited fiji from the *ord* century onwards , and , after a brief period as an independent kingdom , the british established the colony of fiji in *num* .
fiji operated as a crown colony until *num* , when it gained independence as the dominion of fiji .
a military government declared a republic in *num* following a series of coups d'état .
in a coup in *num* , commodore frank bainimarama seized power .
when the high court ruled the military leadership unlawful in *num* , president ratu josefa iloilo , whom the military had retained as the nominal head of state , formally abrogated the *num* constitution and re-appointed bainimarama as interim prime minister .
later in *num* , ratu epeli nailatikau succeeded iloilo as president .
after years of delays , a democratic election took place on *num* september *num* .
bainimarama's fijifirst party won *num* .
*num* % of the vote , and international observers deemed the election credible .
fiji has one of the most developed economies in the pacific thanks to its abundant forest , and mineral and fish resources .
its currency is the fijian dollar , and its main sources of foreign exchange are its tourist industry and sugar exports .
the ministry of local government and urban development supervises fiji's local government , which takes the form of city and town councils .
fiji's main island is known as viti levu and it is from this that the name " fiji " is derived , though the common english pronunciation is based on that of their island neighbours in tonga .
its emergence can be described as follows : fijians first impressed themselves on european consciousness through the writings of the members of the expeditions of cook who met them in tonga .
they were described as formidable warriors and ferocious cannibals , builders of the finest vessels in the pacific , but not great sailors .
they inspired awe amongst the tongans , and all their manufactures , especially bark cloth and clubs , were highly valued and much in demand .
they called their home viti , but the tongans called it fisi , and it was by this foreign pronunciation , fiji , first promulgated by captain james cook , that these islands are now known .
"feejee " , the anglicised spelling of the tongan pronunciation , was used in accounts and other writings until the late *ord* century , by missionaries and other travellers visiting fiji .
located in the central pacific ocean , fiji's geography has made it both a destination and a crossroads for migrations for many centuries .
according to oral tradition , the indigenous fijians of today are descendants of the chief lutunasobasoba and those who arrived with him on the kaunitoni canoe .
landing at what is now vuda , the settlers moved inland to the nakauvadra mountains .
though this oral tradition has not been independently substantiated , the fijian government officially promotes it , and many tribes today claim to be descended from the children of lutunasobasoba .
pottery art from fijian towns shows that fiji was settled by austronesian peoples before or around *num* to *num* bc , with melanesians following around a thousand years later , although the question of pacific migration still lingers .
it is believed that the lapita people or the ancestors of the polynesians settled the islands first but not much is known of what became of them after the melanesians arrived ; they may have had some influence on the new culture , and archaeological evidence shows that they would have then moved on to samoa , tonga and even hawai'i .
archeological evidence shows signs of settlement on moturiki island from *num* bc and possibly as far back as *num* bc .
aspects of fijian culture are similar to the melanesian culture of the western pacific but have a stronger connection to the older polynesian cultures .
trade between fiji and neighbouring archipelagos long before european contact is testified by the canoes made from native fijian trees found in tonga and tongan words being part of the language of the lau group of islands .
pots made in fiji have been found in samoa and even the marquesas islands .
in the *ord* century , the tu'i tonga empire was established in tonga , and fiji came within its sphere of influence .
the tongan influence brought polynesian customs and language into fiji .
the empire began to decline in the *ord* century .
across from east to west , fiji has been a nation of many languages .
fiji's history was one of settlement but also of mobility and over the centuries , a unique fijian culture developed .
large elegant watercraft with rigged sails called " drua " were constructed in fiji , some being exported to tonga .
distinctive village architecture evolved consisting of communal and individual " bure " and " vale " housing with an advanced system of rampants and moats usually being constructed around the more important settlements .
pigs were domesticated for food and a variety of agricultural plantations such as bananas existed from an early stage .
villages would also be supplied with water brought in by constructed wooden aqueducts .
fijians lived in societies that were led by chiefs , elders and notable warriors .
spiritual leaders , often called " bete " , were also important cultural figures and the production and consumption of " yaqona " was part of their ceremonial and community rites .
fijians developed a monetary system where the polished teeth of the sperm whale , called " tambua " , became an active currency .
a type of writing also existed which can be seen today in various petroglyphs around the islands .
they also produced a refined " masi " cloth textile industry with the material being used to make sails and clothes such as the " malo " and the " liku " .
as with most other human civilisations , warfare was an important part of everyday life in pre-colonial fiji the fijians were noted for their use of weapons especially war-clubs .
fijians use many different types of clubs that can be broadly divided into two groups .
the two main types of clubs they used were two handed clubs and small specialised throwing clubs called ula .
with the arrival of europeans and colonialism in the late 1700s , many elements of fijian culture were either repressed or modified to ensure european , namely british , control .
this was especially the case concerning traditional fijian spiritual beliefs .
early colonists and missionaries utilised and conflated the concept of cannibalism in fiji to give a moral imperative for colonial intrusion .
by labelling native fijian customs as " debased and primitive " , they were able to promote a narrative that fiji was a " paradise wasted on savage cannibals " .
extravagant stories made during the *ord* century , such as that regarding ratu udre udre who is said to have consumed *num* people and to have made a pile of stones to record his achievement , permitted an enduring racial typecast of the " uncivilised " fijian .
cannibalism , as an impression , was an effective racial tool deployed by the colonists that has endured through the 1900s and into the modern day .
authors such as deryck scarr , for example , have perpetuated *ord* century claims of " freshly killed corpses piled up for eating " and ceremonial mass human sacrifice on the construction of new houses and boats .
although fiji was known as the " cannibal isles " , other more recent research doubts even the existence of cannibalism in fiji .
this view is not without criticism , and perhaps the most accurate account of cannibalism in *ord* century fiji may come from william macgregor , the long term chief medical officer in british colonial fiji .
during the little war of *num* , he stated that the rare occasion of tasting of the flesh of the enemy was done " to indicate supreme hatred and not out of relish for a gastronomic treat " .
recent archaeological research conducted on fijian sites has begun to shed light on the accuracy of some of these european accounts of cannibalism .
studies conducted by scholars including degusta , cochrane , and jones provide evidence that cannibalism has been practiced in fiji through skeletal modifications such as those due to burning or cutting .
in the jones *num* study , isotopic analysis of bone collagen provided evidence that human flesh had been consumed by fijians , although it was likely a small and not necessarily regular part of the diet .
however , these archaeological accounts indicate that cannibalistic practices were likely more varied and less ubiquitous than european settlers originally described .
exocannibalism , or cannibalism of members of outsider tribes , and cannibalism practiced as a means of violence or revenge probably play a significantly smaller role than european accounts suggested , with nonviolent and ritualistic practices being more likely .
dutch explorer abel tasman was the first known european visitor to fiji , sighting the northern island of vanua levu and the north taveuni archipelago in *num* while looking for the great southern continent .
james cook , the british navigator , visited one of the southern lau islands in *num* .
it was not until *num* , however , that the islands were charted and plotted , when william bligh , the castaway captain of , passed ovalau and sailed between the main islands of viti levu and vanua levu en route to batavia , in what is now indonesia .
bligh water , the strait between the two main islands , is named after him , and for a time , the fiji islands were known as the " bligh islands .
" the first europeans to maintain substantial contact with the fijians were sandalwood merchants , whalers and " beche-de-mer " ( sea cucumber ) traders .
the first whaling vessel known to have visited was the ann and hope in *num* and she was followed by many others in the *ord* century .
these ships came for drinking water , food and firewood and , later , for men to help man their ships .
some of the europeans who came to fiji in this period were accepted by the locals and were allowed to stay as residents .
probably the most famous of these was a swede by the name of kalle svenson , better known as charlie savage .
charlie was permitted to take wives and establish himself in a high rank in bau society in exchange for helping defeat local adversaries .
in *num* , however , charlie became a victim of this lifestyle and was killed in a botched raid .
by the 1820s , levuka was established as the first european-style town in fiji , on the island of ovalau .
the market for " beche-de-mer " in china was lucrative and british and american merchants set up processing stations on various islands .
local fijians were utilised to collect , prepare and pack the product which would then be shipped to asia .
a good cargo would result in a half-yearly profit of around $25 , *num* for the dealer .
the fijian workers were often given firearms and ammunition as an exchange for their labour , and by the end of the 1820s most of the fijian chiefs had muskets and many were skilled at using them .
some fijian chiefs soon felt confident enough with their new weapons to forcibly obtain more destructive weaponry from the europeans .
in *num* , men from viwa and bau were able to take control of the french ship " l'amiable josephine " and use its cannon against their enemies on the rewa river , although they later ran it aground .
christian missionaries like david cargill also arrived in the 1830s from recently converted regions such as tonga and tahiti , and by *num* the european settlement at levuka had grown to about *num* houses with former whaler , david whippey , being a notable resident .
the religious conversion of the fijians was a gradual process which was observed first-hand by captain charles wilkes of the united states exploring expedition .
wilkes wrote that " all the chiefs seemed to look upon christianity as a change in which they had much to lose and little to gain " .
christianised fijians , in addition to forsaking their spiritual beliefs , were pressured into cutting their hair short , adopting the sulu form of dress from tonga and fundamentally changing their marriage and funeral traditions .
this process of enforced cultural change was called " lotu " .
intensification of conflict between the cultures increased and wilkes was also involved in organising a large punitive expedition against the people of malolo .
he ordered an attack with rockets which acted as makeshift incendiary devices .
the village , with the occupants trapped inside , quickly became an inferno with wilkes himself noting that the " shouts of men were intermingled with the cries and shrieks of the women and children " as they burnt to death .
wilkes demanded the survivors should " sue for mercy " and if not " they must expect to be exterminated " .
around *num* to *num* maloloan people were killed in this encounter .
the 1840s was a time of conflict where various fiji clans attempted to assert dominance over each other .
eventually , a warlord by the name of seru epenisa cakobau of bau island was able to become a powerful influence in the region .
his father was ratu tanoa visawaqa , the vunivalu ( a chiefly title meaning " warlord , " often translated also as " paramount chief " ) who had previously defeated the much larger burebasaga confederacy and succeeded in subduing much of western fiji .
cakobau , following on from his father , became so dominant that he was able to expel the europeans from levuka for five years over a dispute about their giving of weapons to his local enemies .
in the early 1850s , cakobau went one step further and decided to declare war on all christians .
his plans were thwarted after the missionaries in fiji received support from the already converted tongans and the presence of a british warship .
the tongan prince enele ma'afu , a christian , had established himself on the island of lakeba in the lau archipelago in *num* , forcibly converting the local people to the methodist church .
cakobau and other chiefs in the west of fiji regarded ma'afu as a threat to their power and resisted his attempts to expand tonga's dominion .
cakobau's influence , however , began to wane and his heavy imposition of taxes on other fijian chiefs , who saw him at best as first among equals , caused them to defect from him .
around this time the united states also became interested in asserting their power in the region and they threatened intervention following a number of incidents involving their consul in the fiji islands , john brown williams .
in *num* , williams had his trading store looted following an accidental fire , caused by stray cannon fire during a fourth of july celebration , and in *num* the european settlement of levuka was burnt to the ground .
williams blamed cakobau for both these incidents and the us representative wanted cakobau's capital at bau destroyed in retaliation .
a naval blockade was instead set up around the island which put further pressure on cakobau to give up on his warfare against the foreigners and their christian allies .
finally , on april *num* , *num* , cakobau offered his " soro " ( supplication ) and yielded to these forces .
he underwent the " lotu " and converted to christianity .
the traditional fijian temples in bau were destroyed and the sacred " nokonoko " trees were cut down .
cakobau and his remaining men were then compelled to join with the tongans , backed by the americans and british , to subjugate the remaining chiefs in the region who still refused to convert .
these chiefs were soon defeated with qaraniqio of the rewa being poisoned and ratu mara of kaba being hanged in *num* .
after these wars , most regions of fiji , except for the interior highland areas , had been forced into giving up much of their traditional systems and were now vassals of western interest .
cakobau was retained as a largely symbolic representative of the fijian people and was allowed to take the ironic title of " tui viti " ( " king of fiji " ) , but the overarching control now lay with foreign powers .
the rising price of cotton in the wake of the american civil war ( 1861–1865 ) saw a flood of hundreds of settlers come to fiji in the 1860s from australia and the united states in order to obtain land and grow cotton .
since there was still a lack of functioning government in fiji , these planters were often able to get the land in violent or fraudulent ways such as exchanging weapons or alcohol with fijians who may or may not have been the true owners .
although this made for cheap land acquisition , competing land claims between the planters became problematic with no unified government to resolve the disputes .
in *num* , the settlers proposed a confederacy of the seven main native kingdoms in fiji to establish some sort of government .
this was initially successful and cakobau was elected as the first president of the confederacy .
with the demand for land high , the white planters started to push into the hilly interior of viti levu , the largest island in the archipelago .
this put them into direct confrontation with the kai colo , which was a general term to describe the various fijian clans resident to these inland districts .
the kai colo were still living a mostly traditional lifestyle , they were not christianised and they were not under the rule of cakobau or the confederacy .
in *num* , a travelling missionary named thomas baker was killed by kai colo in the mountains at the headwaters of the sigatoka river .
the acting british consul , john bates thurston , demanded that cakobau lead a force of fijians from coastal areas to suppress the kai colo .
cakobau eventually led a campaign into the mountains but suffered a humiliating loss with *num* of his fighters being killed .
settlers also came into conflict with the local eastern kai colo people called the wainimala .
john bates thurston called in the australia station section of the royal navy for assistance .
the navy duly sent commander rowley lambert and to conduct a punitive mission against the wainimala .
an armed force of *num* men shelled and burnt the village of deoka and a skirmish ensued which resulted in the deaths of over forty wainimala .
after the collapse of the confederacy , ma'afu established a stable administration in the lau islands and the tongans , therefore , were again becoming influential .
other foreign powers such as the united states were also considering the possibility of annexing fiji .
this situation was not appealing to many settlers , almost all of whom were british subjects from australia .
britain , however , still refused to annex the country and subsequently a compromise was needed .
in june *num* , george austin woods , an ex-lieutenant of the royal navy , managed to influence cakobau and organise a group of like-minded settlers and chiefs into forming a governing administration .
cakobau was declared the monarch ( " tui viti " ) and the kingdom of fiji was established .
most fijian chiefs agreed to participate and even ma'afu chose to recognise cakobau and participate in the constitutional monarchy .
however , many of the settlers had come from british colonies like victoria and new south wales where negotiation with the indigenous people almost universally involved the barrel of a gun .
as a result , several aggressive , racially motivated opposition groups , such as the british subjects mutual protection society , sprouted up .
one group called themselves the ku klux klan in a homage to the white supremacist group in america .
however , when respected individuals such as charles st julian , robert sherson swanston and john bates thurston were appointed by cakobau , a degree of authority was established .
with the rapid increase in white settlers into the country , the desire for land acquisition also intensified .
once again , conflict with the kai colo in the interior of viti levu ensued .
in *num* , the killing of two settlers named spiers and mackintosh near the ba river ( fiji ) in the north-west of the island prompted a large punitive expedition of white farmers , imported slave labourers and coastal fijians to be organised .
this group of around *num* armed vigilantes , including veterans of the us civil war , had a battle with the kai colo near the village of cubu in which both sides had to withdraw .
the village was destroyed and the kai colo , despite being armed with muskets , received numerous casualties .
the kai colo responded by making frequent raids on the settlements of the whites and christian fijians throughout the district of ba .
likewise , in the east of the island on the upper reaches of the rewa river , villages were burnt and a " great many " kai colo were shot by the vigilante settler squad called the rewa rifles .
although the cakobau government did not approve of the settlers taking justice into their own hands , it did want the kai colo subjugated and their land sold off .
the solution was to form an army .
robert s .
swanston , the minister for native affairs in the kingdom , organised the training and arming of suitable fijian volunteers and prisoners to become soldiers in what was invariably called the king's troops or the native regiment .
in a similar system to the native police that was present in the colonies of australia , two white settlers , james harding and w .
fitzgerald , were appointed as the head officers of this paramilitary brigade .
the formation of this force did not sit well with many of the white plantation owners as they did not trust an army of fijians to protect their interests .
the situation intensified further in early *num* when the burns family were killed by a kai colo raid in the ba river area .
the cakobau government deployed *num* king's troopers to the region under the command of major fitzgerald to restore order .
the local whites , with their own large force under the leadership of mr white and mr de courcy ireland , refused their posting and a further deployment of another *num* troops under captain harding was sent to emphasise the government's authority .
to prove the worth of the native regiment , this augmented force went into the interior and massacred about *num* kai colo people at na korowaiwai .
upon returning to the coast , the force were met by the white settlers who still saw the government troops as a threat .
a skirmish between the government's troops and the white settlers ' brigade was only prevented by the timely intervention of captain william cox chapman of who promptly detained mr white and mr de courcy ireland , forcing the group to disband .
the authority of the king's troops and the cakobau government to crush the kai colo was now total .
from march to october *num* , a force of about *num* king's troops under the general administration of r .
s .
swanston with around *num* coastal fijian and white volunteer auxiliaries , led a campaign throughout the highlands of viti levu to annihilate the kai colo .
major fitzgerald and major h .
c .
thurston ( the brother of john bates thurston ) led a two pronged attack throughout the region .
the combined forces of the different clans of the kai colo made a stand at the village of na culi .
the kai colo were defeated with dynamite and fire being used to flush them out from their defensive positions amongst the mountain caves .
many kai colo were killed and one of the main leaders of the hill clans , ratu dradra , was forced to surrender with around *num* men , women and children being taken prisoner and sent to the coast .
in the months after this defeat , the only main resistance was from the clans around the village of nibutautau .
major h .
c .
thurston crushed this resistance in the two months following the battle at na culi .
villages were burnt , kai colo were killed and a further large number of prisoners were taken .
the operations were now over .
about *num* of the prisoners ( men , women and children ) were sent to levuka where some were hanged , the rest being sold into slavery and forced to work on various plantations throughout the islands .
the blackbirding era began in fiji in *num* when the first new hebridean and solomon island labourers were transported there to work on cotton plantations .
the american civil war had cut off the supply of cotton to the international market when the union blockaded southern ports .
cotton cultivation was potentially an extremely profitable business .
thousands of european planters flocked to fiji to establish plantations but found the natives unwilling to adapt to their plans .
they sought labour from the melanesian islands .
on *num* july *num* ben pease received the first licence to provide *num* labourers from the new hebrides to fiji .
the british and queensland governments tried to regulate this recruiting and transport of labour .
melanesian labourers were to be recruited for a term of three years , paid three pounds per year , issued with basic clothing and given access to the company store for supplies .
most melanesians were recruited by deceit , usually being enticed aboard ships with gifts , and then locked up .
the living and working conditions for them in fiji were worse than those suffered by the later indian indentured labourers .
in *num* , the chief medical officer in fiji , sir william macgregor , listed a mortality rate of *num* out of every *num* labourers .
after the expiry of the three-year contract , the government required captains to transport the labourers back to their villages , but most ship captains dropped them off at the first island they sighted off the fiji waters .
the british sent warships to enforce the law ( pacific islanders ' protection act of *num* ) but only a small proportion of the culprits were prosecuted .
a notorious incident of the blackbirding trade was the *num* voyage of the brig " carl " , organised by dr james patrick murray , to recruit labourers to work in the plantations of fiji .
murray had his men reverse their collars and carry black books , so to appear to be church missionaries .
when islanders were enticed to a religious service , murray and his men would produce guns and force the islanders onto boats .
during the voyage murray shot about *num* islanders .
he was never brought to trial for his actions , as he was given immunity in return for giving evidence against his crew members .
the captain of the " carl " , joseph armstrong , was later sentenced to death .
in addition to the blackbirded labour from other pacific islands , thousands of people indigenous to the fijian archipelago were also sold into slavery on the plantations .
as the white settler backed cakobau government , and later the british colonial government , subjugated areas in fiji under its power , the resultant prisoners of war were regularly sold at auction to the planters .
this not only provided a source of revenue for the government , but also dispersed the rebels to different , often isolated islands where the plantations were located .
the land that was occupied by these people before they became slaves was then also sold off for additional revenue .
an example of this is the lovoni people of ovalau island , who after being defeated in a war with the cakobau government in *num* , were rounded up and sold off to the settlers at ₤6 per head .
two thousand lovoni men , women and children were sold and their period of slavery lasted five years .
likewise , after the kai colo wars in *num* , thousands of people from the hill tribes of viti levu were sent to levuka and sold into slavery .
warnings from the royal navy stationed in the area that buying these people was illegal were largely given without enforcement and the british consul in fiji , edward bernard marsh , regularly turned a blind eye to this type of labour trade .
despite achieving military victories over the kai colo , the cakobau government was faced with problems of legitimacy and economic viability .
indigenous fijians and white settlers refused to pay taxes and the cotton price had collapsed .
with these major issues in mind , john bates thurston approached the british government , at cakobau's request , with another offer to cede the islands .
the newly elected tory british government under benjamin disraeli encouraged expansion of the empire and was therefore much more sympathetic to annexing fiji than it had been previously .
the murder of bishop john coleridge patteson of the melanesian mission at nukapu in the reef islands had provoked public outrage , which was compounded by the massacre by crew members of more than *num* fijians on board the brig " carl .
" two british commissioners were sent to fiji to investigate the possibility of an annexation .
the question was complicated by manoeuvrings for power between cakobau and his old rival , ma'afu , with both men vacillating for many months .
on *num* march *num* , cakobau made a final offer , which the british accepted .
on *num* september , sir hercules robinson , soon to be appointed the british governor of fiji , arrived on hms " dido " and received cakobau with a royal 21-gun salute .
after some vacillation , cakobau agreed to renounce his " tui viti " title , retaining the title of " vunivalu " , or protector .
the formal cession took place on *num* october *num* , when cakobau , ma'afu , and some of the senior chiefs of fiji signed two copies of the deed of cession .
thus the colony of fiji was founded ; *num* years of british rule followed .
to celebrate the annexation of fiji , hercules robinson , who was governor of new south wales at the time , took cakobau and his two sons to sydney .
there was a measles outbreak in that city and the three fijians all came down with the disease .
on returning to fiji , the colonial administrators decided not to quarantine the ship that the convalescents travelled in .
this was despite the british having a very extensive knowledge of the devastating effect of infectious disease on an unexposed population .
in 1875–76 , an epidemic of measles resultant of this decision killed over *num* , *num* fijians , about one-third of the fijian population .
some fijians who survived were of the opinion that this failure of quarantine was a deliberate action to introduce the disease into the country .
whether this is the case or not , the decision , which was one of the first acts of british control in fiji , was at the very least grossly negligent .
sir hercules robinson was replaced as governor of fiji in june *num* by sir arthur hamilton gordon .
gordon was immediately faced with an insurgency of the qalimari and kai colo people .
in early *num* , colonial administrator edgar leopold layard , had met with thousands of highland clans at navuso in viti levu to formalise their subjugation to british rule and the christian religion .
layard and his delegation managed to spread the measles epidemic to the highlanders , causing mass deaths in this population .
as a result , anger at the british colonists flared throughout the region and a widespread uprising quickly took hold .
villages along the sigatoka river and in the highlands above this area refused british control and gordon was tasked with quashing this rebellion .
in what gordon himself termed the " little war " , the suppression of this uprising took the form of two co-ordinated military campaigns in the western half of viti levu .
the first was conducted by gordon's second cousin , arthur john lewis gordon , against the qalimari insurgents along the sigatoka river .
the second campaign was led by louis knollys against the kai colo in the mountains to the north of the river .
governor gordon invoked a type of martial law in the area where a .
j .
l .
gordon and knollys had absolute power to conduct their missions outside of any restrictions of legislation .
the two groups of rebels were kept isolated from each other by a force led by walter carew and george le hunte who were stationed at nasaucoko .
carew also ensured the rebellion did not spread east by securing the loyalty of the wainimala people of the eastern highlands .
the war involved the use of the soldiers of the old native regiment of cakobau supported by around *num* christian fijian volunteers from other areas of viti levu .
the colonial government of new zealand provided most of the advanced weapons for the army including one hundred snider rifles .
the campaign along the sigatoka river was conducted under a scorched earth policy whereby numerous rebel villages were burnt and their fields ransacked .
after the capture and destruction of the main fortified towns of koroivatuma , bukutia and matanavatu , the qalimari surrendered " en masse " .
those who weren't killed in the fighting were taken prisoner and sent to the coastal town of cuvu .
this included *num* men , women and children as well as the leader of the insurgents , a man named mudu .
the women and children were distributed to places like nadi and nadroga .
of the men , *num* were sentenced to death at a hastily conducted trial at sigatoka .
governor gordon was present , but chose to leave the judicial responsibility to his relative , a .
j .
l .
gordon .
four were hanged and ten , including mudu , were shot with one prisoner managing to escape .
by the end of proceedings the governor noted that " my feet were literally stained with the blood that i had shed " .
the northern campaign against the kai colo in the highlands was similar but involved removing the rebels from large , well protected caves in the region .
knollys managed to clear the caves " after some considerable time and large expenditure of ammunition " .
the occupants of these caves included whole communities and as a result many men , women and children were either killed or wounded in these operations .
the rest were taken prisoner and sent to the towns on the northern coast .
the chief medical officer in british fiji , william macgregor , also took part both in killing kai colo and tending to their wounded .
after the caves were taken , the kai colo surrendered and their leader , bisiki , was captured .
various trials were held , mostly at nasaucoko under le hunte , and *num* men were either hanged or shot including bisiki , who was killed trying to escape .
by the end of october *num* , the " little war " was over and gordon had succeeded in vanquishing the rebels in the interior of viti levu .
those insurgents who weren't killed or executed were sent into exile with hard labour for up to *num* years .
some non-combatants were allowed to return to rebuild their villages , but many areas in the highlands were ordered by gordon to remain depopulated and in ruins .
gordon also constructed a military fortress , fort canarvon , at the headwaters of the sigatoka river where a large contingent of soldiers were based to maintain british control .
he renamed the native regiment , the armed native constabulary to lessen its appearance of being a military force .
in order to further consolidate social control throughout the colony , governor gordon introduced a system of appointed chiefs and village constables in the various districts to both enact his orders and report any disobedience from the populace .
gordon adopted the chiefly titles " roko " and " buli " to describe these deputies and established a great council of chiefs which was directly subject to his authority as supreme chief .
this body remained in existence until being suspended by the military-backed interim government in *num* and only abolished in *num* .
gordon also extinguished the ability of fijians to own , buy or sell land as individuals , the control being transferred to colonial authorities .
gordon decided in *num* to import indentured labourers from india to work on the sugarcane fields that had taken the place of the cotton plantations .
the *num* indians arrived on *num* may *num* – the first of some *num* , *num* that were to come before the scheme ended in *num* .
the plan involved bringing the indian workers to fiji on a five-year contract , after which they could return to india at their own expense ; if they chose to renew their contract for a second five-year term , they would be given the option of returning to india at the government's expense , or remaining in fiji .
the great majority chose to stay .
the queensland act , which regulated indentured labour in queensland , was made law in fiji also .
between *num* and *num* , tens of thousands of indians moved to fiji to work as indentured labourers , especially on sugarcane plantations .
a total of *num* ships made *num* voyages , carrying indian indentured labourers to fiji .
initially the ships brought labourers from calcutta , but from *num* all ships except two also brought labourers from madras and bombay .
a total of *num* , *num* passengers left india but only *num* , *num* ( including births at sea ) arrived in fiji .
a total of *num* , *num* boarded ships in calcutta and *num* , *num* in madras .
sailing ships took , on average , seventy-three days for the trip while steamers took *num* days .
the shipping companies associated with the labour trade were nourse line and british-india steam navigation company .
repatriation of indentured indians from fiji began on *num* may *num* , when the " british peer " brought *num* repatriated indians to calcutta .
various ships made similar journeys to calcutta and madras , concluding with " / *num* voyage .
in *num* and *num* , three ships brought indian labourers from fiji to sydney , from where the labourers flew to bombay .
indentured indians wishing to return to india were given two options .
one was travel at their own expense and the other free of charge but subject to certain conditions .
to obtain free passage back to india , labourers had to have been above age twelve upon arrival , completed at least five years of service and lived in fiji for a total of ten consecutive years .
a child born to these labourers in fiji could accompany his or her parents or guardian back to india if he or she was under twelve .
due to the high cost of returning at their own expense , most indentured immigrants returning to india left fiji around ten to twelve years after arrival .
indeed , just over twelve years passed between the voyage of the first ship carrying indentured indians to fiji ( the " leonidas " , in *num* ) and the first ship to take indians back ( the " british peer " , in *num* ) .
given the steady influx of ships carrying indentured indians to fiji up until *num* , repatriated indians generally boarded these same ships on their return voyage .
the total number of repatriates under the fiji indenture system is recorded as *num* , *num* , while the number of arrivals is said to have been *num* , *num* .
because the return figure includes children born in fiji , many of the indentured indians never returned to india .
direct return voyages by ship ceased after *num* .
instead , arrangements were made for flights from sydney to bombay , the first of which departed in july *num* .
labourers still travelled to sydney by ship .
with almost all aspects of indigenous fijian social life being controlled by british authorities , a number of charismatic individuals preaching dissent and return to pre-colonial culture were able to forge a following amongst the disenfranchised .
these movements were called tuka , which roughly translates as " those who stand up " .
the first tuka movement , was led by ndoongumoy , better known as navosavakandua which means " he who speaks only once " .
he told his followers that if they returned to traditional ways and worshipped traditional deities such as degei and rokola , their current condition would be transformed with the whites and their puppet fijian chiefs being subservient to them .
navosavakandua was previously exiled from the viti levu highlands in *num* for disturbing the peace and the british quickly arrested him and his followers after this open display of rebellion .
he was again exiled , this time to rotuma where he died soon after his 10-year sentence ended .
other tuka organisations , however , soon appeared .
the british were ruthless in their suppression of both the leaders and followers with figureheads such as sailose being banished to an asylum for *num* years .
in *num* , entire populations of villages who were sympathetic to the tuka ideology were deported as punishment .
three years later in the highlands of vanua levu , where locals had re-engaged in traditional religion , the governor of fiji , john bates thurston , ordered in the armed native constabulary to destroy the towns and the religious relics .
leaders were jailed and villagers exiled or forced to amalgamate into government-run communities .
later , in *num* , apolosi nawai came to the forefront of fijian tuka resistance by founding a co-operative company that would legally monopolise the agricultural sector and boycott european planters .
the company was called the viti kabani and it was a hugely successful .
the british and their proxy council of chiefs were not able to prevent the viti kabani's rise and again the colonists were forced to send in the armed native constabulary .
apolosi and his followers were arrested in *num* and the company collapsed in *num* .
over the next *num* years , apolosi was re-arrested , jailed and exiled , with the british viewing him as a threat right up to his death in *num* .
fiji was only peripherally involved in world war i .
one memorable incident occurred in september *num* when count felix von luckner arrived at wakaya island , off the eastern coast of viti levu , after his raider , , had run aground in the cook islands following the shelling of papeete in the french territory of tahiti .
on *num* september , the district police inspector took a number of fijians to wakaya , and von luckner , not realizing that they were unarmed , unwittingly surrendered .
citing unwillingness to exploit the fijian people , the colonial authorities did not permit fijians to enlist .
one fijian of chiefly rank , a greatgrandson of cakobau's , did join the french foreign legion , however , and received france's highest military decoration , the croix de guerre .
after going on to complete a law degree at oxford university , this same chief returned to fiji in *num* as both a war hero and the country's first-ever university graduate .
in the years that followed , ratu sir lala sukuna , as he was later known , established himself as the most powerful chief in fiji and forged embryonic institutions for what would later become the modern fijian nation .
by the time of world war ii , the united kingdom had reversed its policy of not enlisting natives , and many thousands of fijians volunteered for the fiji infantry regiment , which was under the command of ratu sir edward cakobau , another greatgrandson of seru epenisa cakobau .
the regiment was attached to new zealand and australian army units during the war .
because of its central location , fiji was selected as a training base for the allies .
an airstrip was built at nadi ( later to become an international airport ) , and gun emplacements studded the coast .
fijians gained a reputation for bravery in the solomon islands campaign , with one war correspondent describing their ambush tactics as " death with velvet gloves " .
corporal sefanaia sukanaivalu , of yucata , was posthumously awarded the victoria cross , as a result of his bravery in the battle of bougainville .
a constitutional conference was held in london in july *num* , to discuss constitutional changes with a view to introducing responsible government .
indo-fijians , led by a .
d .
patel , demanded the immediate introduction of full self-government , with a fully elected legislature , to be elected by universal suffrage on a common voters ' roll .
these demands were vigorously rejected by the ethnic fijian delegation , who still feared loss of control over natively owned land and resources should an indo-fijian dominated government come to power .
the british made it clear , however , that they were determined to bring fiji to self-government and eventual independence .
realizing that they had no choice , fiji's chiefs decided to negotiate for the best deal they could get .
a series of compromises led to the establishment of a cabinet system of government in *num* , with ratu kamisese mara as the first chief minister .
ongoing negotiations between mara and sidiq koya , who had taken over the leadership of the mainly indo-fijian national federation party on patel's death in *num* , led to a second constitutional conference in london , in april *num* , at which fiji's legislative council agreed on a compromise electoral formula and a timetable for independence as a fully sovereign and independent nation with the commonwealth .
the legislative council would be replaced with a bicameral parliament , with a senate dominated by fijian chiefs and a popularly elected house of representatives .
in the 52-member house , native fijians and indo-fijians would each be allocated *num* seats , of which *num* would represent " communal constituencies " comprising voters registered on strictly ethnic roles , and another *num* representing " national constituencies " to which members were allocated by ethnicity but elected by universal suffrage .
a further *num* seats were reserved for " general electors " – europeans , chinese , banaban islanders , and other minorities ; *num* of these were " communal " and *num* " national " .
with this compromise , fiji became independent on *num* october *num* .
the british granted fiji independence in *num* .
democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in *num* precipitated by a growing perception that the government was dominated by the indo-fijian ( indian ) community .
the second *num* coup saw both the fijian monarchy and the governor general replaced by a non-executive president and the name of the country changed from " dominion of fiji " to " republic of fiji " and then in *num* to " republic of the fiji islands " .
the two coups and the accompanying civil unrest contributed to heavy indo-fijian emigration ; the resulting population loss resulted in economic difficulties and ensured that melanesians became the majority .
in *num* , the new constitution institutionalised ethnic fijian domination of the political system .
the group against racial discrimination ( gard ) was formed to oppose the unilaterally imposed constitution and to restore the *num* constitution .
in *num* sitiveni rabuka , the lieutenant colonel who had carried out the *num* coup , became prime minister following elections held under the new constitution .
three years later , rabuka established the constitutional review commission , which in *num* wrote a new constitution which was supported by most leaders of the indigenous fijian and indo-fijian communities .
fiji was re-admitted to the commonwealth of nations .
the year *num* brought along another coup , instigated by george speight , which effectively toppled the government of mahendra chaudhry , who in *num* had become the country's first indo-fijian prime minister following the adoption of the new constitution .
commodore frank bainimarama assumed executive power after the resignation , possibly forced , of president ratu sir kamisese mara .
later in *num* , fiji was rocked by two mutinies when rebel soldiers went on a rampage at suva's queen elizabeth barracks .
the high court ordered the reinstatement of the constitution , and in september *num* , to restore democracy , a general election was held which was won by interim prime minister laisenia qarase's soqosoqo duavata ni lewenivanua party .
in *num* , the qarase government amid much controversy proposed a reconciliation and unity commission with power to recommend compensation for victims of the *num* coup and amnesty for its perpetrators .
however , the military , especially the nation's top military commander , frank bainimarama , strongly opposed this bill .
bainimarama agreed with detractors who said that to grant amnesty to supporters of the present government who had played a role in the violent coup was a sham .
his attack on the legislation , which continued unremittingly throughout may and into june and july , further strained his already tense relationship with the government .
in late november and early december *num* , bainimarama was instrumental in the *num* fijian coup d'état .
bainimarama handed down a list of demands to qarase after a bill was put forward to parliament , part of which would have offered pardons to participants in the *num* coup attempt .
he gave qarase an ultimatum date of *num* december to accede to these demands or to resign from his post .
qarase adamantly refused either to concede or resign , and on *num* december the president , ratu josefa iloilo , was said to have signed a legal order dissolving the parliament after meeting with bainimarama .
in april *num* , the fiji court of appeal ruled that the *num* coup had been illegal .
this began the *num* fijian constitutional crisis .
president iloilo abrogated the constitution , removed all office holders under the constitution including all judges and the governor of the central bank .
he then reappointed bainimarama under his " new order " as interim prime minister and imposed a " public emergency regulation " limiting internal travel and allowing press censorship .
for a country of its size , fiji has fairly large armed forces , and has been a major contributor to un peacekeeping missions in various parts of the world .
in addition , a significant number of former military personnel have served in the lucrative security sector in iraq following the *num* us-led invasion .
fiji covers a total area of some of which around *num* % is land .
fiji is the hub of the south west pacific , midway between vanuatu and tonga .
the archipelago is located between 176° 53′ east and 178° 12′ west .
the 180° meridian runs through taveuni but the international date line is bent to give uniform time ( utc+12 ) to all of the fiji group .
with the exception of rotuma , the fiji group lies between 15° 42′ and 20° 02′ south .
rotuma is located north of the group , from suva , 12° 30′ south of the equator .
fiji consists of *num* islands ( of which *num* are inhabited ) and *num* smaller islets .
the two most important islands are viti levu and vanua levu , which account for about three-quarters of the total land area of the country .
the islands are mountainous , with peaks up to *num* , *num* metres ( *num* , *num* ft ) , and covered with thick tropical forests .
the highest point is mount tomanivi on viti levu .
viti levu hosts the capital city of suva , and is home to nearly three-quarters of the population .
other important towns include nadi ( the location of the international airport ) , and lautoka , fiji's second city with large sugar cane mills and a seaport .
the main towns on vanua levu are labasa and savusavu .
other islands and island groups include taveuni and kadavu ( the third and fourth largest islands , respectively ) , the mamanuca group ( just off nadi ) and yasawa group , which are popular tourist destinations , the lomaiviti group , off suva , and the remote lau group .
rotuma , some north of the archipelago , has a special administrative status in fiji .
ceva-i-ra , an uninhabited reef , is located about southwest of the main archipelago .
the climate in fiji is tropical marine and warm year round with minimal extremes .
the warm season is from november to april and the cooler season lasts from may to october .
temperatures in the cool season still average .
rainfall is variable , with the warm season experiencing heavier rainfall , especially inland .
for the larger islands , rainfall is heavier on the southeast portions of the islands than on the northwest portions , with consequences for agriculture in those areas .
winds are moderate , though cyclones occur about once a year ( 10–12 times per decade ) .
on *num* february *num* , fiji was hit by the full force of cyclone winston , the only category *num* tropical cyclone to make landfall in the nation .
winston destroyed tens of thousands of homes across the island , killing *num* people and causing an estimated fj$2 billion ( us$1 billion ) in damage .
politics in fiji normally take place in the framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic wherein the prime minister of fiji is the head of government and the president the head of state , and of a multi-party system .
executive power is exercised by the government , legislative power is vested in both the government and the parliament of fiji , and the judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature .
citing corruption in the government , commodore josaia voreqe ( frank ) bainimarama , commander of the republic of fiji military forces , staged a military takeover on *num* december *num* against the prime minister that he had installed after a *num* coup .
there had also been a military coup in *num* .
the commodore took over the powers of the presidency and dissolved the parliament , paving the way for the military to continue the takeover .
the coup was the culmination of weeks of speculation following conflict between the elected prime minister , laisenia qarase , and commodore bainimarama .
bainimarama had repeatedly issued demands and deadlines to the prime minister .
a particular issue was previously pending legislation to pardon those involved in the *num* coup .
bainimarama named jona senilagakali as caretaker prime minister .
the next week bainimarama said he would ask the great council of chiefs to restore executive powers to the president , ratu josefa iloilo .
on *num* january *num* , the military announced that it was restoring executive power to president iloilo , who made a broadcast endorsing the actions of the military .
the next day , iloilo named bainimarama as the interim prime minister , indicating that the military was still effectively in control .
in the wake of the takeover , reports emerged of alleged intimidation of some of those critical of the interim regime .
on *num* april *num* , the court of appeal overturned the high court decision that cdre .
bainimarama's takeover of qarase's government was lawful and declared the interim government to be illegal .
bainimarama agreed to step down as interim pm immediately , along with his government , and president iloilo was to appoint " a distinguished person independent of the parties to this litigation as caretaker prime minister , .
.
.
to direct the issuance of writs for an election " .
on *num* april *num* , president iloilo suspended the constitution of fiji , dismissed the court of appeal and , in his own words , " appoint [ ed ] [ him ] self as the head of the state of fiji under a new legal order " .
as president , iloilo had been head of state prior to his abrogation of the constitution , but that position had been determined by the constitution itself .
the " new legal order " did not depend on the constitution , thus requiring a " reappointment " of the head of state .
" you will agree with me that this is the best way forward for our beloved fiji " , he said .
bainimarama was re-appointed as interim prime minister ; he , in turn , re-instated his previous cabinet .
on *num* may *num* , fiji became the first nation ever to have been suspended from participation in the pacific islands forum , for its failure to hold democratic elections by the date promised .
nevertheless , it remains a member of the forum .
on *num* september *num* , fiji was suspended from the commonwealth of nations .
the action was taken because cdre .
bainimarama failed to hold elections by *num* as the commonwealth of nations had demanded after the *num* coup .
cdre .
bainimarama stated a need for more time to end a voting system that heavily favoured ethnic fijians at the expense of the multi-ethnic minorities .
critics , however , claimed that he had suspended the constitution and was responsible for human rights violations by arresting and detaining opponents .
in his *num* new year's address , cdre .
bainimarama announced the lifting of the public emergency regulations ( per ) .
however , the per was not rescinded until january *num* , *num* and the suva philosophy club was the first organisation to reorganise and convene public meetings .
the per had been put in place in april *num* when the former constitution was abrogated .
the per had allowed restrictions on speech , public gatherings , and censorship of news media and had given security forces added powers .
he also announced a nationwide consultation process leading to a new constitution under which the *num* elections were to be held .
on *num* march *num* , the commonwealth ministerial action group voted to change fiji's full suspension from the commonwealth of nations to a suspension from the councils of the commonwealth , allowing them to participate in a number of commonwealth activities , including the *num* commonwealth games .
the suspension was lifted in september *num* .
a general election took place on *num* september *num* .
bainimarama's fijifirst party won with *num* .
*num* % of the vote , and the election was deemed credible by a group of international observers from australia , india and indonesia .
the military consists of the republic of fiji military forces ( rfmf ) with a total manpower of *num* , *num* active soldiers and *num* , *num* reservists , and includes a navy unit of *num* personnel .
the land force comprises the fiji infantry regiment ( regular and territorial force organised into six light infantry battalions ) , fiji engineer regiment , logistic support unit and force training group .
the two regular battalions are traditionally stationed overseas on peacekeeping duties .
the law enforcement branch is composed of : fiji is divided into four major divisions which are further divided into *num* provinces .
they are : fiji was also divided into *num* confederacies or governments during the reign of seru epenisa cakobau , though these are not considered political divisions , they are still considered important in the social divisions of the indigenous fijians : endowed with forest , mineral , and fish resources , fiji is one of the most developed of the pacific island economies , though still with a large subsistence sector .
some progress was experienced by this sector when marion m .
ganey , s .
j .
, introduced credit unions to the islands in the 1950s .
natural resources include timber , fish , gold , copper , offshore oil , and hydropower .
fiji experienced a period of rapid growth in the 1960s and 1970s but stagnated in the 1980s .
the coup of *num* caused further contraction .
economic liberalisation in the years following the coup created a boom in the garment industry and a steady growth rate despite growing uncertainty regarding land tenure in the sugar industry .
the expiration of leases for sugar cane farmers ( along with reduced farm and factory efficiency ) has led to a decline in sugar production despite subsidies for sugar provided by the eu ; fiji has been the second largest beneficiary of sugar subsidies after mauritius .
fiji's vital gold mining industry based in vatukoula , which shut down in *num* , was reactivated in *num* .
urbanisation and expansion in the service sector have contributed to recent gdp growth .
sugar exports and a rapidly growing tourist industry – with tourists numbering *num* , *num* in *num* and increasing in the subsequent years – are the major sources of foreign exchange .
fiji is highly dependent on tourism for revenue .
sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial activity .
long-term problems include low investment and uncertain property rights .
the political turmoil in fiji in the 1980s , the 1990s , and *num* had a severe impact on the economy , which shrank by *num* .
*num* % in *num* and grew by only *num* % in *num* .
the tourism sector recovered quickly , however , with visitor arrivals reaching pre-coup levels in *num* , resulting in a modest economic recovery which continued into *num* and *num* but grew by a mere *num* .
*num* % in *num* and by *num* .
*num* % in *num* .
although inflation is low , the policy indicator rate of the reserve bank of fiji was raised by *num* % to *num* .
*num* % in february *num* due to fears of excessive consumption financed by debt .
lower interest rates have so far not produced greater investment in exports .
however , there has been a housing boom due to declining commercial mortgage rates .
the tallest building in fiji is the fourteen-storey reserve bank of fiji building in suva , which was inaugurated in *num* .
the suva central commercial centre , which opened in november *num* , was planned to outrank the reserve bank building at seventeen stories , but last-minute design changes ensured that the reserve bank building remained the tallest .
trade and investment with fiji have been criticised due to the country's military dictatorship .
in *num* , fiji's interim prime minister and coup leader frank bainimarama announced election delays and said that fiji would pull out of the pacific islands forum in niue , where bainimarama was to have met with australian prime minister kevin rudd and new zealand prime minister helen clark .
the south pacific stock exchange ( spse ) is the only licensed securities exchange in fiji and is based in suva .
its vision is to become a regional exchange .

according to the fiji bureau of statistics , most visitors arriving to fiji on a short term basis are from the following countries or regions of residence : the nadi international airport is located north of central nadi and is the largest fijian hub .
nausori international airport is about northeast of downtown suva and serves mostly domestic traffic with flights from australia and new zealand .
the main airport in the second largest island of vanua levu is labasa airport located at waiqele , southwest of labasa town .
the largest aircraft handled by labasa airport is the atr *num* .
airports fiji limited ( afl ) is responsible for the operation of *num* public airports in the fiji islands .
these include two international airports : nadi international airport , fiji's main international gateway , and nausori airport , fiji's domestic hub , and *num* outer island airports .
fiji's main airline was previously known as air pacific , but is now known as fiji airways .
fiji's larger islands have extensive bus routes that are affordable and consistent in service .
there are bus stops , and in rural areas buses are often simply hailed as they approach .
buses are the principal form of public transport and passenger movement between the towns on the main islands .
buses also serve on roll-on-roll-off inter-island ferries .
bus fares and routes are heavily regulated by the land transport authority ( lta ) .
bus and taxi drivers hold public service licenses ( psvs ) issued by the lta .
taxis are licensed by the lta and operate widely all over the country .
apart from urban , town-based taxis , there are others that are licensed to serve rural or semi-rural areas .
the flagfall for regular taxis is f$1 .
*num* and tariff is f$0 .
*num* for every *num* meters .
for taxis that are allowed to charge value added tax ( vat ) , the flagfall is f$1 .
*num* and tariff is f$0 .
*num* for the first *num* meters , and f$0 .
*num* for every *num* meters thereafter .
taxis operating out of fiji's international airport , nadi charge a flagfall of f$5 .
the elderly and government welfare recipients are given a *num* % discount on their taxi fares .
inter-island ferries provide services between fiji's principal islands and large vessels operate roll-on-roll-off services , transporting vehicles and large amounts of cargo between the main island of viti levu and vanua levu , and other smaller islands .
fiji is the only developing pacific island country with recent data for gross domestic expenditure on research and development ( gerd ) .
the national bureau of statistics cites a gerd / gdp ratio of *num* .
*num* % in *num* .
private-sector research and development ( r&d ) is negligible .
government investment in r&d tends to favour agriculture .
in *num* , agriculture and primary production accounted for just under half of government expenditure on r&d , according to the fijian national bureau of statistics .
this share had risen to almost *num* % by *num* .
however , scientists publish much more in the field of geosciences and health than in agriculture .
the rise in government spending on agricultural research has come to the detriment of research in education , which dropped to *num* % of total research spending between *num* and *num* .
government expenditure on health research has remained fairly constant , at about *num* % of total government research spending , according to the fijian national bureau of statistics .
the fijian ministry of health is seeking to develop endogenous research capacity through the " fiji journal of public health " , which it launched in *num* .
a new set of guidelines are now in place to help build endogenous capacity in health research through training and access to new technology .
fiji is also planning to diversify its energy sector through the use of science and technology .
in *num* , the secretariat of the pacific community observed that , ' while fiji , papua new guinea and samoa are leading the way with large-scale hydropower projects , there is enormous potential to expand the deployment of other renewable energy options such as solar , wind , geothermal and ocean-based energy sources ' .
in *num* , the centre of renewable energy became operational at the university of fiji , with the assistance of the renewable energy in pacific island countries developing skills and capacity programme ( epic ) funded by the european union .
since the programme's inception in *num* , epic has also developed a master's programme in renewable energy management for the university of fiji .
the *num* census found that the population of fiji was *num* , *num* , compared to the population of *num* , *num* in the *num* census .
the population density at the time of the *num* census was *num* .
*num* inhabitants per square kilometre .
the life expectancy in fiji was *num* .
*num* years .
since the 1930s the population of fiji has increased at a rate of *num* .
*num* % per year .
the population is dominated by the 15–64 age segment .
the median age of the population was *num* .
*num* , and the gender ratio was *num* .
*num* males per *num* female .
the population of fiji is mostly made up of native fijians , who are melanesians ( *num* .
*num* % ) , although many also have polynesian ancestry , and indo-fijians ( *num* .
*num* % ) , descendants of indian contract labourers brought to the islands by the british colonial powers in the *ord* century .
the percentage of the population of indo-fijian descent has declined significantly over the last two decades due to migration for various reasons .
indo-fijians suffered reprisals for a period after the fiji coup of *num* .
there is also a small but significant group of descendants of indentured labourers from the solomon islands .
about *num* .
*num* % are rotuman — natives of rotuma island , whose culture has more in common with countries such as tonga or samoa than with the rest of fiji .
there are also small but economically significant groups of europeans , chinese , and other pacific island minorities .
the total membership of other ethnic groups of pacific islanders is about *num* , *num* .
relationships between ethnic fijians and indo-fijians in the political arena have often been strained , and the tension between the two communities has dominated politics in the islands for the past generation .
the level of political tension varies among different regions of the country .
the concept of family and community is of great importance to fijian culture .
within the indigenous ( itaukei ) communities many members of the extended family will adopt particular titles and roles of direct guardians .
kinship is determined through a child's lineage to a particular spiritual leader , so that a clan is based on traditional customary ties as opposed to actual biological links .
these clans , based on the spiritual leader , are known as a matangali .
within the matangali are a number of smaller collectives , known as the mbito .
the descent is patrilineal , and all the status is derived from the father's side .
within fiji , many argue that the term " fijian " refers solely to indigenous fijians : it denotes an ancestral ethnicity , not a nationality .
constitutionally , citizens of fiji were previously referred to as " fiji islanders " though the term " fiji nationals " was used for official purposes .
however , the current constitution refers to all fijian citizens as " fijians " .
in august *num* , shortly before the proposed people's charter for change , peace and progress was due to be released to the public , it was announced that it recommended a change in the name of fiji's citizens .
if the proposal were adopted , all citizens of fiji , whatever their ethnicity , would be called " fijians " .
the proposal would change the english name of indigenous fijians from " fijians " to " itaukei " , the fijian language endonym for indigenous fijians .
deposed prime minister laisenia qarase reacted by stating that the name " fijian " belonged exclusively to indigenous fijians , and that he would oppose any change in legislation enabling non-indigenous fijians to use it .
the methodist church , to which a large majority of indigenous fijians belong , also reacted strongly to the proposal , stating that allowing any fiji citizen to call themselves " fijian " would be " daylight robbery " inflicted on the indigenous population .
in an address to the nation during the constitutional crisis of april *num* , military leader and interim prime minister voreqe bainimarama , who has been at the forefront of the attempt to change the definition of " fijian " , stated : in may *num* , attorney-general aiyaz sayed-khaiyum reiterated that the term " fijian " should apply to all fiji nationals , but the statement was again met with protest .
a spokesperson for the viti landowners and resource owners association claimed that even fourth-generation descendants of migrants did not fully understand " what it takes to be a fijian " , and added that the term refers to a legal standing , since legislation affords specific rights to " fijians " ( meaning , in legislation , indigenous fijians ) .
fiji academic brij lal , although a prominent critic of the bainimarama government , said he " would not be surprised " if the new definition of the word " fijian " were included in the government's projected new constitution , and that he personally saw " no reason the term fijian should not apply to everyone from fiji " .
fijian is an austronesian language of the malayo-polynesian family spoken in fiji .
it has *num* , *num* first-language speakers , which is less than half the population of fiji , but another *num* , *num* speak it as a second language .
the *num* constitution established fijian as an official language of fiji , along with english and fiji hindi .
fijian is a vos language .
the fiji islands developed many dialects , which may be classified in two major branches — eastern and western .
missionaries in the 1840s chose an eastern dialect , the speech of bau island off the southeast coast of the main island of viti levu , to be the written standard of the fijian language .
bau island was home to seru epenisa cakobau , the chief who eventually became the self-proclaimed king of fiji .
according to the *num* census , *num* .
*num* % of the population at the time was christian , while *num* .

with *num* .
*num* % of the population ( including almost two-thirds of ethnic fijians ) , the proportion of the population adhering to methodism is higher in fiji than in any other nation .
in *num* , permission was granted by the government for methodists to hold their annual conference , for the first time in four years , with the conditions that the conference not coincide with the national hibiscus festival and should only last for three days , and that no political matters were to be discussed , only church matters .
roman catholics are headed by the metropolitan archdiocese of suva , whose province also includes the dioceses of rarotonga ( on the cook islands , for those and niue , both new zealand-associated countries ) and tarawa and nauru ( with see at tarawa on kiribati , also for nauru ) and the mission sui iuris of tokelau ( again with new zealand ) .
this reflects that much major roman catholic missionary activity was conducted through the former apostolic prefecture ( created in *num* from the apostolic vicariate of central oceania ) , then apostolic vicariate of fiji , which has since been promoted to archdiocese of suva , which spans the whole of fiji .
furthermore , the assemblies of god , the seventh-day adventists and the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints ( lds church ) are significant .
fiji also is the base for the anglican diocese of polynesia ( part of the anglican church in aotearoa , new zealand and polynesia ) .

every year the israeli embassy organises a passover celebration with about 50–60 people attending .
, primary and secondary school education in fiji is free ; it is compulsory for eight years .
as of *num* , attendance was decreasing due to security concerns and the burden of school fees , often due to the cost of transport .

fiji's culture is a rich mosaic of indigenous fijian , indo-fijian , asian and european traditions , comprising social polity , language , food ( coming mainly from the sea , plus casava , dalo ( taro ) and other vegetables ) , costume , belief systems , architecture , arts , craft , music , dance , and sports .
while indigenous fijian culture and traditions are very vibrant and are integral components of everyday life for the majority of fiji's population , fijian society has evolved over the past century with the introduction of traditions such as indian and chinese as well as significant influences from europe and fiji's pacific neighbours , particularly tonga and samoa .
thus , the various cultures of fiji have come together to create a unique multicultural national identity .
fiji's culture was showcased at the world exposition held in vancouver , canada , in *num* and more recently at the shanghai world expo *num* , along with other pacific countries in the pacific pavilion .
this is a list of holidays celebrated in fiji : the exact dates of public holidays vary from year to year , but the dates for the next year can be found at the fiji government web site the following holidays are no longer celebrated in fiji : sports are very popular in fiji , particularly sports involving physical contact .
fiji's national sport is rugby sevens .
rugby union is the most-popular team sport played in fiji .
the fiji national sevens side is a popular and successful international rugby sevens team , and has won the hong kong sevens a record eighteen times since its inception in *num* .
fiji has also won the rugby world cup sevens twice — in *num* and *num* .
the fiji national rugby union sevens team is the reigning sevens world series champions in world rugby .
in *num* , they won fiji's first ever olympic medal in the rugby sevens at the summer olympics , winning gold by defeating great britain 43-7 in the final .
the national rugby union team has competed at five rugby world cup competitions , the first being in *num* , where they reached the quarter-finals .
the fiji national side did not match that feat again until the *num* rugby world cup when they upset wales 38–34 to progress to the quarter-finals where they lost to the eventual rugby world cup winners , south africa .
fiji also defeated the british and irish lions in *num* .
fiji competes in the pacific tri-nations and the irb pacific nations cup .
the sport is governed by the fiji rugby union which is a member of the pacific islands rugby alliance , and contributes to the pacific islanders rugby union team .
at the club level there are the skipper cup and farebrother trophy challenge .
the fiji national rugby union team is a member of the pacific islands rugby alliance ( pira ) formerly along with samoa and tonga .
in *num* , samoa announced their departure from the pacific islands rugby alliance , leaving just fiji and tonga in the union .
fiji is currently ranked eleventh in the world by the irb ( ) .
fiji is one of the few countries where rugby union is the main sport .
there are about *num* , *num* registered players from a total population of around *num* , *num* .
one of the problems for fiji is simply getting their players to play for their home country , as many have contracts in europe with the french top *num* and the english aviva premiership or with super rugby teams , where monetary compensation is far more rewarding .
the repatriated salaries of its overseas stars have become an important part of some local economies .
in addition , a significant number of players eligible to play for fiji end up representing australia or new zealand ; notable examples are fiji-born cousins and former new zealand all blacks , joe rokocoko and sitiveni sivivatu , current all blacks waisake naholo and seta tamanivalu as well as australian wallabies former winger , lote tuqiri and current wallabies tevita kuridrani , samu kerevi and henry speight .
fiji has won the most pacific tri-nations championships of the three participating teams .
the fiji national rugby league team , nicknamed the bati ( pronounced [ mˈbatʃi ] ) , represents fiji in the sport of rugby league football and has been participating in international competition since *num* .
it has competed in the rugby league world cup on three occasions , with their best results coming when they made consecutive semi-final appearances in the *num* rugby league world cup and *num* rugby league world cup .
the team also competes in the pacific cup .
members of the team are selected from a domestic fijian competition , as well as from competitions held in new zealand and australia .
for the *num* , *num* and *num* world cups , the bati were captained by lote tuqiri , wes naiqama and the legendary petero civoniceva respectively .
fiji have also produced stars like akuila uate , jarryd hayne , kevin naiqama , semi tadulala , marika koroibete , apisai koroisau , sisa waqa and the sims brothers ashton sims , tariq sims and korbin sims .
the cibi ( pronounced " thimbi " ) war dance was traditionally performed by the fiji rugby team before each match .
it was replaced in *num* with the new " bole " ( pronounced " mbolay " ) war cry .
tradition holds that the original cibi was first performed on the rugby field back in *num* during a tour of new zealand , when then fijian captain ratu sir george cakobau felt that his team should have something to match the haka of the all blacks .
the ' cibi ' had perhaps been used incorrectly though , as the word actually means " a celebration of victory by warriors , " whereas ' bole ' is the acceptance of a challenge .
the fiji bati rugby league team also gather in a huddle and perform the hymn ' noqu masu ' before each match .
association football was traditionally a minor sport in fiji , popular largely amongst the indo-fijian community , but with international funding from fifa and sound local management over the past decade , the sport has grown in popularity in the wider fijian community .
it is now the second most-popular sport in fiji , after rugby ( union 15's and union 7's ) for men , and after netball for women .
the fiji football association is a member of the oceania football confederation .
the national football team defeated new zealand 2–0 in the *num* ofc nations cup , on their way to a joint-record third-place finish .
however , they have never reached a fifa world cup to date .
fiji won the pacific games football tournament in *num* and *num* .
fiji qualified for the *num* summer olympics men's tournament for the first time in history .
due to the success of fiji's national basketball teams , the popularity of basketball in fiji has experienced rapid growth in recent years .
in the past , the country only had few basketball courts , which severely limited fijians who desired to practice the sport more frequently .
due to recent efforts by the national federation " basketball fiji " and with the support of the australian government , many schools have been able to construct courts and provide their students with basketball equipment such as shoes , etc .
netball is the most popular women's participation sport in fiji .
the national team has been internationally competitive , at netball world cup competitions reaching *ord* position in *num* , its highest level to date .
the team won gold medals at the *num* and *num* pacific games .
cricket is a minor sport in fiji .
cricket fiji is an associate member of the international cricket council ( " icc " ) .
the fiji u19 team won the *num* edition of the icc east asia-pacific tournament , and consequently qualified for the *num* under-19 world cup .
doing so made it the first u19 team other than papua new guinea u19 team to qualify from the region .
fusion cuisine fusion cuisine is cuisine that combines elements of different culinary traditions .
cuisines of this type are not categorized according to any one particular cuisine style and have played a part in innovations of many contemporary restaurant cuisines since the 1970s .
fusion food is a general term for the combination of various forms of cookery and comes in several forms .
regional fusion combines different cuisines of a region or sub-region .
asian fusion restaurants , which combine the various cuisines of different asian countries , have become popular in many parts of the united states and united kingdom .
often featured are east asian , south-east asian , and south asian dishes alongside one another and offering dishes that are inspired combinations of such cuisines .
california cuisine is considered a fusion culture , taking inspiration particularly from italy , france , mexico , the idea of the european delicatessen , and eastern asia , and then creating traditional dishes from these cultures with non-traditional ingredients - such as california pizza .
other examples of this style include tex-mex , which combines southwestern united states cuisine and mexican cuisines , and pacific rim cuisine , which combines the different cuisines of the various island nations .
in the united kingdom , fish and chips can be seen as an early fusion dish due to its marrying of ingredients stemming from jewish , french , and belgian cuisines .
filipino cuisine is also sometimes characterized as the " original asian fusion cuisine " , combining native culinary traditions and ingredients with the very different cuisines of spain , latin america , china , and the united states , among others , due to its unique colonial history .
in australia , due to the increasing influx of migrants , fusion cuisine is being reinvented and is becoming increasingly the norm at numerous cafes and restaurants , with modern australian asian-fusion restaurants like tetsuya's in sydney ranking highly in the world's *num* best restaurants .
another incarnation of fusion cuisine implements a more eclectic approach , which generally features original dishes that combine varieties of ingredients from various cuisines and regions .
such a restaurant might feature a wide variety of dishes inspired by a combination of various regional cuisines with new ideas .
foods in malaysia ( also indonesia ) are another popular example of fusion cuisine between malay , javanese , chinese and indian and light influences from thai , portuguese , dutch , and british cuisines .
foods based on one culture , but prepared using ingredients and flavors inherent to another culture , are also considered forms of fusion cuisine .
for instance , pizza made with cheddar and pepper jack cheese , salsa , refried beans or other common taco ingredients is often marketed as " taco pizza " .
this particular dish is a fusion of italian and mexican cuisines .
similar approaches have been used for fusion-sushi , such as rolling maki with different types of rice and ingredients such as curry and basmati rice , cheese and salsa with spanish rice , or spiced ground lamb and capers rolled with greek-style rice and grape leaves , which resembles inside-out dolmades .
some fusion cuisines have themselves become accepted as a national cuisine , as with peruvian nikkei cuisine , which combines japanese spices and seasonings and peruvian ingredients like ají ( peruvian peppers ) with seafood .
a quintessential peruvian nikkei dish is " ‘maki acevichado’ or ceviche roll , containing peruvian-style marinated fish rolled up with rice , avocado , or seaweed .
" this type of restaurant's success depends on a number of factors .
among these are : wolfgang puck is attributed as one of the pioneers of fusion cuisine , with some dispute .
however , his restaurant " chinois on main " was named after the term attributed to richard wing , who in the 1960s combined french and chinese cooking at the former imperial dynasty restaurant in hanford , california .
big bang the big bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model for the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution .
the model describes how the universe expanded from a very high-density and high-temperature state , and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of phenomena , including the abundance of light elements , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , large scale structure and hubble's law ( the farther away galaxies are , the faster they are moving away from earth ) .
if the observed conditions are extrapolated backwards in time using the known laws of physics , the prediction is that just before a period of very high density there was a singularity which is typically associated with the big bang .
physicists are undecided whether this means the universe began from a singularity , or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time .
detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the big bang at around *num* .
*num* billion years ago , which is thus considered the age of the universe .
after its initial expansion , the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles , and later simple atoms .
giant clouds of these primordial elements ( mostly hydrogen , with some helium and lithium ) later coalesced through gravity , eventually forming early stars and galaxies , the descendants of which are visible today .
astronomers also observe the gravitational effects of dark matter surrounding galaxies .
though most of the mass in the universe seems to be in the form of dark matter , big bang theory and various observations seem to indicate that it is not made out of conventional baryonic matter ( protons , neutrons , and electrons ) but it is unclear exactly what it " is " made out of .
since georges lemaître first noted in *num* that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point , scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion .
the scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different theories , the big bang and the steady state theory , but a wide range of empirical evidence has strongly favored the big bang which is now universally accepted .
in *num* , from analysis of galactic redshifts , edwin hubble concluded that galaxies are drifting apart ; this is important observational evidence consistent with the hypothesis of an expanding universe .
in *num* , the cosmic microwave background radiation was discovered , which was crucial evidence in favor of the big bang model , since that theory predicted the existence of background radiation throughout the universe before it was discovered .
more recently , measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating , an observation attributed to dark energy's existence .
the known physical laws of nature can be used to calculate the characteristics of the universe in detail back in time to an initial state of extreme density and temperature .
the belgian astronomer and catholic priest georges lemaître proposed on theoretical grounds that the universe is expanding , which was observationally confirmed soon afterwards by edwin hubble .
in *num* in the " annales de la société scientifique de bruxelles " ( " annals of the scientific society of brussels " ) under the title " un univers homogène de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des nébuleuses extragalactiques " ( " a homogeneous universe of constant mass and growing radius accounting for the radial velocity of extragalactic nebulae " ) , he presented his new idea that the universe is expanding and provided the first observational estimation of what is known as the hubble constant .
what later will be known as the " big bang theory " of the origin of the universe , he called his " hypothesis of the primeval atom " or the " cosmic egg " .
american astronomer edwin hubble observed that the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts .
this was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance : that is , the farther they are , the faster they move away from us , regardless of direction .
assuming the copernican principle ( that the earth is not the center of the universe ) , the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others .
since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today , it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together .
the continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past .
large particle accelerators can replicate the conditions that prevailed after the early moments of the universe , resulting in confirmation and refinement of the details of the big bang model .
however , these accelerators can only probe so far into high energy regimes .
consequently , the state of the universe in the earliest instants of the big bang expansion is still poorly understood and an area of open investigation and speculation .
the first subatomic particles to be formed included protons , neutrons , and electrons .
though simple atomic nuclei formed within the first three minutes after the big bang , thousands of years passed before the first electrically neutral atoms formed .
the majority of atoms produced by the big bang were hydrogen , along with helium and traces of lithium .
giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity to form stars and galaxies , and the heavier elements were synthesized either within stars or during supernovae .
the big bang theory offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena , including the abundance of light elements , the cmb , large scale structure , and hubble's law .
the framework for the big bang model relies on albert einstein's theory of general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space .
the governing equations were formulated by alexander friedmann , and similar solutions were worked on by willem de sitter .
since then , astrophysicists have incorporated observational and theoretical additions into the big bang model , and its parametrization as the lambda-cdm model serves as the framework for current investigations of theoretical cosmology .
the lambda-cdm model is the current " standard model " of big bang cosmology , consensus is that it is the simplest model that can account for the various measurements and observations relevant to cosmology .
extrapolation of the expansion of the universe backwards in time using general relativity yields an infinite density and temperature at a finite time in the past .
this singularity indicates that general relativity is not an adequate description of the laws of physics in this regime .
models based on general relativity alone can not extrapolate toward the singularity beyond the end of the planck epoch .
this primordial singularity is itself sometimes called " the big bang " , but the term can also refer to a more generic early hot , dense phase of the universe .
in either case , " the big bang " as an event is also colloquially referred to as the " birth " of our universe since it represents the point in history where the universe can be verified to have entered into a regime where the laws of physics as we understand them ( specifically general relativity and the standard model of particle physics ) work .
based on measurements of the expansion using type ia supernovae and measurements of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background , the time that has passed since that event — otherwise known as the " age of the universe " — is *num* .
*num* ± *num* .
*num* billion years .
the agreement of independent measurements of this age supports the λcdm model that describes in detail the characteristics of the universe .
despite being extremely dense at this time—far denser than is usually required to form a black hole—the universe did not re-collapse into a black hole .
this may be explained by considering that commonly-used calculations and limits for gravitational collapse are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size , such as stars , and do not apply to rapidly expanding space such as the big bang .
the earliest phases of the big bang are subject to much speculation .
in the most common models the universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with a very high energy density and huge temperatures and pressures and was very rapidly expanding and cooling .
approximately *num* seconds into the expansion , a phase transition caused a cosmic inflation , during which the universe grew exponentially during which time density fluctuations that occurred because of the uncertainty principle were amplified into the seeds that would later form the large-scale structure of the universe .
after inflation stopped , reheating occurred until the universe obtained the temperatures required for the production of a quark–gluon plasma as well as all other elementary particles .
temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at relativistic speeds , and particle–antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions .
at some point , an unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation of baryon number , leading to a very small excess of quarks and leptons over antiquarks and antileptons—of the order of one part in *num* million .
this resulted in the predominance of matter over antimatter in the present universe .
the universe continued to decrease in density and fall in temperature , hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing .
symmetry breaking phase transitions put the fundamental forces of physics and the parameters of elementary particles into their present form .
after about *num* seconds , the picture becomes less speculative , since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in particle accelerators .
at about *num* seconds , quarks and gluons combined to form baryons such as protons and neutrons .
the small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons .
the temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs ( similarly for neutrons–antineutrons ) , so a mass annihilation immediately followed , leaving just one in *num* of the original protons and neutrons , and none of their antiparticles .
a similar process happened at about *num* second for electrons and positrons .
after these annihilations , the remaining protons , neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the universe was dominated by photons ( with a minor contribution from neutrinos ) .
a few minutes into the expansion , when the temperature was about a billion ( one thousand million ) kelvin and the density was about that of air , neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's deuterium and helium nuclei in a process called big bang nucleosynthesis .
most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei .
as the universe cooled , the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon radiation .
after about *num* , *num* years , the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms ( mostly hydrogen ) ; hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded .
this relic radiation is known as the cosmic microwave background radiation .
the chemistry of life may have begun shortly after the big bang , *num* .
*num* billion years ago , during a habitable epoch when the universe was only 10–17 million years old .
over a long period of time , the slightly denser regions of the nearly uniformly distributed matter gravitationally attracted nearby matter and thus grew even denser , forming gas clouds , stars , galaxies , and the other astronomical structures observable today .
the details of this process depend on the amount and type of matter in the universe .
the four possible types of matter are known as cold dark matter , warm dark matter , hot dark matter , and baryonic matter .
the best measurements available , from wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) , show that the data is well-fit by a lambda-cdm model in which dark matter is assumed to be cold ( warm dark matter is ruled out by early reionization ) , and is estimated to make up about *num* % of the matter / energy of the universe , while baryonic matter makes up about *num* .
*num* % .
in an " extended model " which includes hot dark matter in the form of neutrinos , then if the " physical baryon density " formula_1 is estimated at about *num* .
*num* ( this is different from the ' baryon density ' formula_2 expressed as a fraction of the total matter / energy density , which as noted above is about *num* .
*num* ) , and the corresponding cold dark matter density formula_3 is about *num* .
*num* , the corresponding neutrino density formula_4 is estimated to be less than *num* .
*num* .
independent lines of evidence from type ia supernovae and the cmb imply that the universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as dark energy , which apparently permeates all of space .
the observations suggest *num* % of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form .
when the universe was very young , it was likely infused with dark energy , but with less space and everything closer together , gravity predominated , and it was slowly braking the expansion .
but eventually , after numerous billion years of expansion , the growing abundance of dark energy caused the expansion of the universe to slowly begin to accelerate .
dark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the cosmological constant term in einstein's field equations of general relativity , but its composition and mechanism are unknown and , more generally , the details of its equation of state and relationship with the standard model of particle physics continue to be investigated both through observation and theoretically .
all of this cosmic evolution after the inflationary epoch can be rigorously described and modeled by the λcdm model of cosmology , which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and einstein's general relativity .
there is no well-supported model describing the action prior to *num* seconds or so .
apparently a new unified theory of quantum gravitation is needed to break this barrier .
understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the universe is currently one of the greatest unsolved problems in physics .
the big bang theory depends on two major assumptions : the universality of physical laws and the cosmological principle .
the cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is homogeneous and isotropic .
these ideas were initially taken as postulates , but today there are efforts to test each of them .
for example , the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the fine structure constant over much of the age of the universe is of order *num* .
also , general relativity has passed stringent tests on the scale of the solar system and binary stars .
if the large-scale universe appears isotropic as viewed from earth , the cosmological principle can be derived from the simpler copernican principle , which states that there is no preferred ( or special ) observer or vantage point .
to this end , the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of *num* via observations of the cmb .
the universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the *num* % level .
general relativity describes spacetime by a metric , which determines the distances that separate nearby points .
the points , which can be galaxies , stars , or other objects , are themselves specified using a coordinate chart or " grid " that is laid down over all spacetime .
the cosmological principle implies that the metric should be homogeneous and isotropic on large scales , which uniquely singles out the friedmann–lemaître–robertson–walker metric ( flrw metric ) .
this metric contains a scale factor , which describes how the size of the universe changes with time .
this enables a convenient choice of a coordinate system to be made , called comoving coordinates .
in this coordinate system , the grid expands along with the universe , and objects that are moving only because of the expansion of the universe , remain at fixed points on the grid .
while their " coordinate " distance ( comoving distance ) remains constant , the " physical " distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the scale factor of the universe .
the big bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe .
instead , space itself expands with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points .
in other words , the big bang is not an explosion " in space " , but rather an expansion " of space " .
because the flrw metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy , it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space .
an important feature of the big bang spacetime is the presence of particle horizons .
since the universe has a finite age , and light travels at a finite speed , there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us .
this places a limit or a " past horizon " on the most distant objects that can be observed .
conversely , because space is expanding , and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly , light emitted by us today may never " catch up " to very distant objects .
this defines a " future horizon " , which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence .
the presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the flrw model that describes our universe .
our understanding of the universe back to very early times suggests that there is a past horizon , though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the universe at early times .
so our view cannot extend further backward in time , though the horizon recedes in space .
if the expansion of the universe continues to accelerate , there is a future horizon as well .
english astronomer fred hoyle is credited with coining the term " big bang " during a *num* bbc radio broadcast , saying : " these theories were based on the hypothesis that all the matter in the universe was created in one big bang at a particular time in the remote past .
" it is popularly reported that hoyle , who favored an alternative " steady state " cosmological model , intended this to be pejorative , but hoyle explicitly denied this and said it was just a striking image meant to highlight the difference between the two models .
the big bang theory developed from observations of the structure of the universe and from theoretical considerations .
in *num* vesto slipher measured the first doppler shift of a " spiral nebula " ( spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies ) , and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from earth .
he did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact , and indeed at the time it was highly controversial whether or not these nebulae were " island universes " outside our milky way .
ten years later , alexander friedmann , a russian cosmologist and mathematician , derived the friedmann equations from albert einstein's equations of general relativity , showing that the universe might be expanding in contrast to the static universe model advocated by einstein at that time .
in *num* edwin hubble's measurement of the great distance to the nearest spiral nebulae showed that these systems were indeed other galaxies .
independently deriving friedmann's equations in *num* , georges lemaître , a belgian physicist , proposed that the inferred recession of the nebulae was due to the expansion of the universe .
in *num* lemaître went further and suggested that the evident expansion of the universe , if projected back in time , meant that the further in the past the smaller the universe was , until at some finite time in the past all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point , a " primeval atom " where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence .
starting in *num* , hubble painstakingly developed a series of distance indicators , the forerunner of the cosmic distance ladder , using the hooker telescope at mount wilson observatory .
this allowed him to estimate distances to galaxies whose redshifts had already been measured , mostly by slipher .
in *num* hubble discovered a correlation between distance and recession velocity—now known as hubble's law .
lemaître had already shown that this was expected , given the cosmological principle .
in the 1920s and 1930s almost every major cosmologist preferred an eternal steady state universe , and several complained that the beginning of time implied by the big bang imported religious concepts into physics ; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the steady state theory .
this perception was enhanced by the fact that the originator of the big bang theory , georges lemaître , was a roman catholic priest .
arthur eddington agreed with aristotle that the universe did not have a beginning in time , " viz " .
, that matter is eternal .
a beginning in time was " repugnant " to him .
lemaître , however , thought thatif the world has begun with a single quantum , the notions of space and time would altogether fail to have any meaning at the beginning ; they would only begin to have a sensible meaning when the original quantum had been divided into a sufficient number of quanta .
if this suggestion is correct , the beginning of the world happened a little before the beginning of space and time .
during the 1930s other ideas were proposed as non-standard cosmologies to explain hubble's observations , including the milne model , the oscillatory universe ( originally suggested by friedmann , but advocated by albert einstein and richard tolman ) and fritz zwicky's tired light hypothesis .
after world war ii , two distinct possibilities emerged .
one was fred hoyle's steady state model , whereby new matter would be created as the universe seemed to expand .
in this model the universe is roughly the same at any point in time .
the other was lemaître's big bang theory , advocated and developed by george gamow , who introduced big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and whose associates , ralph alpher and robert herman , predicted the cmb .
ironically , it was hoyle who coined the phrase that came to be applied to lemaître's theory , referring to it as " this " big bang " idea " during a bbc radio broadcast in march *num* .
for a while , support was split between these two theories .
eventually , the observational evidence , most notably from radio source counts , began to favor big bang over steady state .
the discovery and confirmation of the cmb in *num* secured the big bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe .
much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form in the context of the big bang , understanding the physics of the universe at earlier and earlier times , and reconciling observations with the basic theory .
in *num* and *num* roger penrose , stephen hawking , and george f .
r .
ellis published papers where they showed that mathematical singularities were an inevitable initial condition of general relativistic models of the big bang .
then , from the 1970s to the 1990s , cosmologists worked on characterizing the features of the big bang universe and resolving outstanding problems .
in *num* , alan guth made a breakthrough in theoretical work on resolving certain outstanding theoretical problems in the big bang theory with the introduction of an epoch of rapid expansion in the early universe he called " inflation " .
meanwhile , during these decades , two questions in observational cosmology that generated much discussion and disagreement were over the precise values of the hubble constant and the matter-density of the universe ( before the discovery of dark energy , thought to be the key predictor for the eventual fate of the universe ) .
in the mid-1990s , observations of certain globular clusters appeared to indicate that they were about *num* billion years old , which conflicted with most then-current estimates of the age of the universe ( and indeed with the age measured today ) .
this issue was later resolved when new computer simulations , which included the effects of mass loss due to stellar winds , indicated a much younger age for globular clusters .
while there still remain some questions as to how accurately the ages of the clusters are measured , globular clusters are of interest to cosmology as some of the oldest objects in the universe .
significant progress in big bang cosmology has been made since the late 1990s as a result of advances in telescope technology as well as the analysis of data from satellites such as cobe , the hubble space telescope and wmap .
cosmologists now have fairly precise and accurate measurements of many of the parameters of the big bang model , and have made the unexpected discovery that the expansion of the universe appears to be accelerating .
the earliest and most direct observational evidence of the validity of the theory are the expansion of the universe according to hubble's law ( as indicated by the redshifts of galaxies ) , discovery and measurement of the cosmic microwave background and the relative abundances of light elements produced by big bang nucleosynthesis .
more recent evidence includes observations of galaxy formation and evolution , and the distribution of large-scale cosmic structures , these are sometimes called the " four pillars " of the big bang theory .
precise modern models of the big bang appeal to various exotic physical phenomena that have not been observed in terrestrial laboratory experiments or incorporated into the standard model of particle physics .
of these features , dark matter is currently subjected to the most active laboratory investigations .
remaining issues include the cuspy halo problem and the dwarf galaxy problem of cold dark matter .
dark energy is also an area of intense interest for scientists , but it is not clear whether direct detection of dark energy will be possible .
inflation and baryogenesis remain more speculative features of current big bang models .
viable , quantitative explanations for such phenomena are still being sought .
these are currently unsolved problems in physics .
observations of distant galaxies and quasars show that these objects are redshifted—the light emitted from them has been shifted to longer wavelengths .
this can be seen by taking a frequency spectrum of an object and matching the spectroscopic pattern of emission lines or absorption lines corresponding to atoms of the chemical elements interacting with the light .
these redshifts are uniformly isotropic , distributed evenly among the observed objects in all directions .
if the redshift is interpreted as a doppler shift , the recessional velocity of the object can be calculated .
for some galaxies , it is possible to estimate distances via the cosmic distance ladder .
when the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances , a linear relationship known as hubble's law is observed : formula_5 where hubble's law has two possible explanations .
either we are at the center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the copernican principle—or the universe is uniformly expanding everywhere .
this universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by alexander friedmann in *num* and georges lemaître in *num* , well before hubble made his *num* analysis and observations , and it remains the cornerstone of the big bang theory as developed by friedmann , lemaître , robertson , and walker .
the theory requires the relation formula_9 to hold at all times , where formula_7 is the comoving distance , " v " is the recessional velocity , and formula_6 , formula_12 , and formula_7 vary as the universe expands ( hence we write formula_8 to denote the present-day hubble " constant " ) .
for distances much smaller than the size of the observable universe , the hubble redshift can be thought of as the doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity formula_6 .
however , the redshift is not a true doppler shift , but rather the result of the expansion of the universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected .
that space is undergoing metric expansion is shown by direct observational evidence of the cosmological principle and the copernican principle , which together with hubble's law have no other explanation .
astronomical redshifts are extremely isotropic and homogeneous , supporting the cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions , along with much other evidence .
if the redshifts were the result of an explosion from a center distant from us , they would not be so similar in different directions .
measurements of the effects of the cosmic microwave background radiation on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in *num* proved the copernican principle , that , on a cosmological scale , the earth is not in a central position .
radiation from the big bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times throughout the universe .
uniform cooling of the cmb over billions of years is explainable only if the universe is experiencing a metric expansion , and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion .
in *num* arno penzias and robert wilson serendipitously discovered the cosmic background radiation , an omnidirectional signal in the microwave band .
their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the big-bang predictions by alpher , herman and gamow around *num* .
through the 1970s the radiation was found to be approximately consistent with a black body spectrum in all directions ; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe , and today corresponds to approximately *num* .
*num* k .
this tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the big bang model , and penzias and wilson were awarded a nobel prize in *num* .
the " surface of last scattering " corresponding to emission of the cmb occurs shortly after " recombination " , the epoch when neutral hydrogen becomes stable .
prior to this , the universe comprised a hot dense photon-baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly scattered from free charged particles .
peaking at around , the mean free path for a photon becomes long enough to reach the present day and the universe becomes transparent .
in *num* , nasa launched the cosmic background explorer satellite ( cobe ) , which made two major advances : in *num* , high-precision spectrum measurements showed that the cmb frequency spectrum is an almost perfect blackbody with no deviations at a level of *num* part in *num* , and measured a residual temperature of *num* .
*num* k ( more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to *num* .
*num* k ) ; then in *num* , further cobe measurements discovered tiny fluctuations ( anisotropies ) in the cmb temperature across the sky , at a level of about one part in *num* .
john c .
mather and george smoot were awarded the *num* nobel prize in physics for their leadership in these results .
during the following decade , cmb anisotropies were further investigated by a large number of ground-based and balloon experiments .
in 2000–2001 several experiments , most notably boomerang , found the shape of the universe to be spatially almost flat by measuring the typical angular size ( the size on the sky ) of the anisotropies .
in early *num* , the first results of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) were released , yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters .
the results disproved several specific cosmic inflation models , but are consistent with the inflation theory in general .
the planck space probe was launched in may *num* .
other ground and balloon based cosmic microwave background experiments are ongoing .
using the big bang model it is possible to calculate the concentration of helium-4 , helium-3 , deuterium , and lithium-7 in the universe as ratios to the amount of ordinary hydrogen .
the relative abundances depend on a single parameter , the ratio of photons to baryons .
this value can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of cmb fluctuations .
the ratios predicted ( by mass , not by number ) are about *num* .
*num* for / / , about *num* for / / , about *num* for / / and about *num* for / / .
the measured abundances all agree at least roughly with those predicted from a single value of the baryon-to-photon ratio .
the agreement is excellent for deuterium , close but formally discrepant for / , and off by a factor of two for / ; in the latter two cases there are substantial systematic uncertainties .
nonetheless , the general consistency with abundances predicted by big bang nucleosynthesis is strong evidence for the big bang , as the theory is the only known explanation for the relative abundances of light elements , and it is virtually impossible to " tune " the big bang to produce much more or less than 20–30 % helium .
indeed , there is no obvious reason outside of the big bang that , for example , the young universe ( i .
e .
, before star formation , as determined by studying matter supposedly free of stellar nucleosynthesis products ) should have more helium than deuterium or more deuterium than / , and in constant ratios , too .
detailed observations of the morphology and distribution of galaxies and quasars are in agreement with the current state of the big bang theory .
a combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the big bang , and since then , larger structures have been forming , such as galaxy clusters and superclusters .
populations of stars have been aging and evolving , so that distant galaxies ( which are observed as they were in the early universe ) appear very different from nearby galaxies ( observed in a more recent state ) .
moreover , galaxies that formed relatively recently , appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the big bang .
these observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model .
observations of star formation , galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures , agree well with big bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe , and are helping to complete details of the theory .
in *num* , astronomers found what they believe to be pristine clouds of primordial gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars .
before this discovery , all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars .
these two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium .
since the clouds of gas have no heavy elements , they likely formed in the first few minutes after the big bang , during big bang nucleosynthesis .
the age of the universe as estimated from the hubble expansion and the cmb is now in good agreement with other estimates using the ages of the oldest stars , both as measured by applying the theory of stellar evolution to globular clusters and through radiometric dating of individual population ii stars .
the prediction that the cmb temperature was higher in the past has been experimentally supported by observations of very low temperature absorption lines in gas clouds at high redshift .
this prediction also implies that the amplitude of the sunyaev–zel'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies does not depend directly on redshift .
observations have found this to be roughly true , but this effect depends on cluster properties that do change with cosmic time , making precise measurements difficult .
future gravitational waves observatories might be able to detect primordial gravitational waves , relics of the early universe , up to less than a second after the big bang .
as with any theory , a number of mysteries and problems have arisen as a result of the development of the big bang theory .
some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding .
proposed solutions to some of the problems in the big bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own .
for example , the horizon problem , the magnetic monopole problem , and the flatness problem are most commonly resolved with inflationary theory , but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many , including some founders of the theory , say it has been disproven .
what follows are a list of the mysterious aspects of the big bang theory still under intense investigation by cosmologists and astrophysicists .
it is not yet understood why the universe has more matter than antimatter .
it is generally assumed that when the universe was young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons .
however , observations suggest that the universe , including its most distant parts , is made almost entirely of matter .
a process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry .
for baryogenesis to occur , the sakharov conditions must be satisfied .
these require that baryon number is not conserved , that c-symmetry and cp-symmetry are violated and that the universe depart from thermodynamic equilibrium .
all these conditions occur in the standard model , but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry .
measurements of the redshift–magnitude relation for type ia supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe has been accelerating since the universe was about half its present age .
to explain this acceleration , general relativity requires that much of the energy in the universe consists of a component with large negative pressure , dubbed " dark energy " .
dark energy , though speculative , solves numerous problems .
measurements of the cosmic microwave background indicate that the universe is very nearly spatially flat , and therefore according to general relativity the universe must have almost exactly the critical density of mass / energy .
but the mass density of the universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering , and is found to have only about *num* % of the critical density .
since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the " missing " energy density .
dark energy also helps to explain two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the universe , one using the frequency of gravitational lenses , and the other using the characteristic pattern of the large-scale structure as a cosmic ruler .
negative pressure is believed to be a property of vacuum energy , but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the big bang .
results from the wmap team in *num* are in accordance with a universe that consists of *num* % dark energy , *num* % dark matter , *num* .
*num* % regular matter and less than *num* % neutrinos .
according to theory , the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe , but the dark energy density remains constant ( or nearly so ) as the universe expands .
therefore , matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today , but its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as dark energy becomes even more dominant .
the dark energy component of the universe has been explained by theorists using a variety of competing theories including einstein's cosmological constant but also extending to more exotic forms of quintessence or other modified gravity schemes .
a cosmological constant problem , sometimes called the " most embarrassing problem in physics " , results from the apparent discrepancy between the measured energy density of dark energy , and the one naively predicted from planck units .
during the 1970s and the 1980s , various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies .
this led to the idea that up to *num* % of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic matter .
in addition , the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations .
in particular , the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter .
while dark matter has always been controversial , it is inferred by various observations : the anisotropies in the cmb , galaxy cluster velocity dispersions , large-scale structure distributions , gravitational lensing studies , and x-ray measurements of galaxy clusters .
indirect evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter , as no dark matter particles have been observed in laboratories .
many particle physics candidates for dark matter have been proposed , and several projects to detect them directly are underway .
additionally , there are outstanding problems associated with the currently favored cold dark matter model which include the dwarf galaxy problem and the cuspy halo problem .
alternative theories have been proposed that do not require a large amount of undetected matter , but instead modify the laws of gravity established by newton and einstein ; yet no alternative theory has been as successful as the cold dark matter proposal in explaining all extant observations .
the horizon problem results from the premise that information cannot travel faster than light .
in a universe of finite age this sets a limit—the particle horizon—on the separation of any two regions of space that are in causal contact .
the observed isotropy of the cmb is problematic in this regard : if the universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering , the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about *num* degrees on the sky .
there would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions to have the same temperature .
a resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period ( before baryogenesis ) .
during inflation , the universe undergoes exponential expansion , and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed , so that regions presently on opposite sides of the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon .
the observed isotropy of the cmb then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation .
heisenberg's uncertainty principle predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be quantum thermal fluctuations , which would be magnified to cosmic scale .
these fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the universe .
inflation predicts that the primordial fluctuations are nearly scale invariant and gaussian , which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the cmb .
if inflation occurred , exponential expansion would push large regions of space well beyond our observable horizon .
a related issue to the classic horizon problem arises because in most standard cosmological inflation models , inflation ceases well before electroweak symmetry breaking occurs , so inflation should not be able to prevent large-scale discontinuities in the electroweak vacuum since distant parts of the observable universe were causally separate when the electroweak epoch ended .
the magnetic monopole objection was raised in the late 1970s .
grand unified theories predicted topological defects in space that would manifest as magnetic monopoles .
these objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe , resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations , given that no monopoles have been found .
this problem is also resolved by cosmic inflation , which removes all point defects from the observable universe , in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness .
the flatness problem ( also known as the oldness problem ) is an observational problem associated with a friedmann–lemaître–robertson–walker metric ( flrw ) .
the universe may have positive , negative , or zero spatial curvature depending on its total energy density .
curvature is negative if its density is less than the critical density ; positive if greater ; and zero at the critical density , in which case space is said to be " flat " .
the problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time , and yet the universe today remains very close to flat .
given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the planck time , *num* seconds , the fact that the universe has reached neither a heat death nor a big crunch after billions of years requires an explanation .
for instance , even at the relatively late age of a few minutes ( the time of nucleosynthesis ) , the density of the universe must have been within one part in *num* of its critical value , or it would not exist as it does today .
physics may conclude that time did not exist before ' big bang ' , but ' started ' with the big bang and hence there might be no ' beginning ' , ' before ' or potentially ' cause ' and instead always existed .
quantum fluctuations , or other laws of physics that may have existed at the start of the big bang could then create the conditions for matter to occur .
before observations of dark energy , cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the universe .
if the mass density of the universe were greater than the critical density , then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse .
it would become denser and hotter again , ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a big crunch .
alternatively , if the density in the universe were equal to or below the critical density , the expansion would slow down but never stop .
star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy ; stars would burn out , leaving white dwarfs , neutron stars , and black holes .
very gradually , collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes .
the average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach absolute zero—a big freeze .
moreover , if the proton were unstable , then baryonic matter would disappear , leaving only radiation and black holes .
eventually , black holes would evaporate by emitting hawking radiation .
the entropy of the universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it , a scenario known as heat death .
modern observations of accelerating expansion imply that more and more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our event horizon and out of contact with us .
the eventual result is not known .
the λcdm model of the universe contains dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant .
this theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems , such as galaxies , will remain together , and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools .
other explanations of dark energy , called phantom energy theories , suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters , stars , planets , atoms , nuclei , and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called big rip .
the following is a partial list of misconceptions about the big bang model : "the big bang as the origin of the universe : " one of the common misconceptions about the big bang model is the belief that it was the origin of the universe .
however , the big bang model does not comment about how the universe came into being .
current conception of the big bang model assumes the existence of energy , time , and space , and does not comment about their origin or the cause of the dense and high temperature initial state of the universe .
"the big bang was " small" " : it is misleading to visualize the big bang by comparing its size to everyday objects .
when the size of the universe at big bang is described , it refers to the size of the observable universe , and not the entire universe .
"hubble's law violates the special theory of relativity " : hubble's law predicts that galaxies that are beyond hubble distance recede faster than the speed of light .
however , special relativity does not apply beyond motion through space .
hubble's law describes velocity that results from expansion " of " space , rather than " through " space .
"doppler redshift vs cosmological red-shift " : astronomers often refer to the cosmological red-shift as a normal doppler shift , which is a misconception .
although similar , the cosmological red-shift is not identical to the doppler redshift .
the doppler redshift is based on special relativity , which does not consider the expansion of space .
on the contrary , the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity , in which the expansion of space is considered .
although they may appear identical for nearby galaxies , it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the doppler redshift .
while the big bang model is well established in cosmology , it is likely to be refined .
the big bang theory , built upon the equations of classical general relativity , indicates a singularity at the origin of cosmic time ; this infinite energy density is regarded as impossible in physics .
still , it is known that the equations are not applicable before the time when the universe cooled down to the planck temperature , and this conclusion depends on various assumptions , of which some could never be experimentally verified .
" ( also see planck epoch .
) " one proposed refinement to avoid this would-be singularity is to develop a correct treatment of quantum gravity .
it is not known what could have preceded the hot dense state of the early universe or how and why it originated , though speculation abounds in the field of cosmogony .
some proposals , each of which entails untested hypotheses , are : proposals in the last two categories see the big bang as an event in either a much larger and older universe or in a multiverse .
as a description of the origin of the universe , the big bang has significant bearing on religion and philosophy .
as a result , it has become one of the liveliest areas in the discourse between science and religion .
some believe the big bang implies a creator , and some see its mention in their holy books , while others argue that big bang cosmology makes the notion of a creator superfluous .
gulf coast of the united states the gulf coast of the united states is the coastline along the southern united states where they meet the gulf of mexico .
the coastal states that have a shoreline on the gulf of mexico are texas , louisiana , mississippi , alabama , and florida , and these are known as the " gulf states " .
the economy of the gulf coast area is dominated by industries related to energy , petrochemicals , fishing , aerospace , agriculture , and tourism .
the large cities of the region are ( from west to east ) mcallen , brownsville , corpus christi , houston , galveston , beaumont , lafayette , baton rouge , new orleans , biloxi , mobile , pensacola , st .
petersburg , tampa , and increasingly , sarasota .
all are the centers of their respective metropolitan areas and contain large ports .
( baton rouge is relatively far from the gulf of mexico ; its port is on the mississippi river , as is the port of new orleans .
) the gulf coast is made of many inlets , bays , and lagoons .
the coast is also intersected by numerous rivers , the largest of which is the mississippi river .
much of the land along the gulf coast is , or was , marshland .
ringing the gulf coast is the gulf coastal plain which reaches from southern texas to the western florida panhandle while the western portions of the gulf coast are made up of many barrier islands and peninsulas , including the padre island and galveston island located in the u .
s .
state of texas .
these landforms protect numerous bays and inlets providing as a barrier to oncoming waves .
the central part of the gulf coast , from eastern texas through louisiana , consists primarily of marshland .
the eastern part of the gulf coast , predominantly florida , is dotted with many bays and inlets .
the gulf coast climate is humid subtropical , although the southwestern tip of florida , such as naples , features a tropical climate .
much of the year is warm to hot along the gulf coast , while the *num* winter months bring periods of cool ( or rarely , cold ) weather mixed with mild temperatures .
the area is vulnerable to hurricanes as well as floods and severe thunderstorms .
much of the gulf coast has a summer precipitation maximum , with july or august commonly the wettest month due to the combination of frequent summer thunderstorms produced by relentless heat and humidity , and tropical weather systems ( tropical depressions , tropical storms and hurricanes ) , while winter and early spring rainfall also can be heavy .
this pattern is evident at new orleans , louisiana , mobile , alabama and pensacola , florida .
however , the central and southern florida peninsula has a pronounced winter dry season , as at tampa and fort myers , florida .
on the central and southern texas coast , winter , early spring and mid-summer are markedly drier , and september is the wettest month on average ( as at corpus christi and brownsville , texas ) .
tornadoes are infrequent at the coast but do occur ; however , they occur more frequently in inland portions of gulf coast states .
over most of the gulf coast from houston , texas eastward , extreme rainfall events are a significant threat , commonly from tropical weather systems , which can bring *num* to *num* or more inches of rain in a single day .
in august *num* , hurricane harvey made landfall along the central texas coast , then migrated to and stalled over the greater houston area for several days , producing extreme , unprecedented rainfall totals of over *num* inches ( *num* , *num* mm ) in many areas , unleashing widespread flooding .
earthquakes are extremely rare to the area , but a surprising *num* .
*num* earthquake in the gulf of mexico on september *num* , *num* , could be felt from the cities of new orleans to tampa .
the gulf coast is a major center of economic activity .
the marshlands along the louisiana and texas coasts provide breeding grounds and nurseries for ocean life that drive the fishing and shrimping industries .
the port of south louisiana ( metropolitan new orleans in laplace ) and the port of houston are two of the ten busiest ports in the world by cargo volume .
as of *num* , seven of the top ten busiest ports in the u .
s .
are on the gulf coast .
the discovery of oil and gas deposits along the coast and offshore , combined with easy access to shipping , have made the gulf coast the heart of the u .
s .
petrochemical industry .
the coast contains nearly *num* , *num* oil platforms .
besides the above , the region features other important industries including aerospace and biomedical research , as well as older industries such as agriculture and — especially since the development of the gulf coast beginning in the 1920s and the increase in wealth throughout the united states — tourism .
before europeans arrived in the region , the region was home to several pre-columbian kingdoms that had extensive trade networks with empires such as the aztecs and the mississippi mound builders .
shark and alligator teeth and shells from the gulf have been found as far north as ohio , in the mounds of the hopewell culture .
the first europeans to settle the gulf coast were primarily the french and the spanish .
the louisiana purchase , adams–onís treaty and the texas revolution made the gulf coast a part of the united states during the first half of the *ord* century .
as the u .
s .
population continued to expand its frontiers westward , the gulf coast was a natural magnet in the south providing access to shipping lanes and both national and international commerce .
the development of sugar and cotton production ( enabled by slavery ) allowed the south to prosper .
by the mid *ord* century the city of new orleans , being situated as a key to commerce on the mississippi river and in the gulf , had become the largest u .
s .
city not on the atlantic seaboard and the fourth largest in the u .
s .
overall .
two major events were turning points in the earlier history of the gulf coast region .
the first was the american civil war , which caused severe damage to some economic sectors in the south , including the gulf coast .
the second event was the galveston hurricane of *num* .
at the end of the *ord* century galveston was , with new orleans , one of the most developed cities in the region .
the city had the third busiest port in the u .
s .
and its financial district was known as the " wall street of the south " .
the storm mostly destroyed the city , which has never regained its former glory , and set back development in the region .
since then the gulf coast has been hit with numerous other hurricanes .
in *num* , hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast as a category *num* hurricane .
it was the most damaging storm in the history of the united states , causing upwards of $80 billion in damages , and leaving over *num* , *num* dead .
again in *num* the gulf coast was struck by a catastrophic hurricane .
due to its immense size , hurricane ike caused devastation from the louisiana coastline all the way to the kenedy county , texas region near corpus christi .
in addition , ike caused flooding and significant damage along the mississippi coastline and the florida panhandle ike killed *num* people and left upwards of *num* people missing , never to be found .
hurricane ike was the third most damaging storm in the history of the united states , causing more than $25 billion in damage along the coast , leaving hundreds of thousands of people homeless , and sparking the largest search-and-rescue operation in u .
s .
history .
other than the hurricanes , the gulf coast has redeveloped dramatically over the course of the *ord* century .
the gulf coast is highly populated .
the petrochemical industry , launched with the major discoveries of oil in texas and spurred on by further discoveries in the gulf waters , has been a vehicle for development in the central and western gulf which has spawned development on a variety of fronts in these regions .
texas in particular has benefited tremendously from this industry over the course of the *ord* century and economic diversification has made the state a magnet for population and home to more fortune *num* companies than any other u .
s .
state .
florida has grown as well , driven to a great extent by its long established tourism industry but also by its position as a gateway to the caribbean and latin america .
as of *num* , these two states are the second and fourth most populous states in the nation , respectively ( see this article ) .
other areas of the gulf coast have benefited less , though economic development fueled by tourism has greatly increased property values along the coast , and is now a severe danger to the valuable but fragile ecosystems of the gulf coast .
the following table lists the *num* largest msas along the gulf coast .
context-free language in formal language theory , a context-free language ( cfl ) is a language generated by a context-free grammar ( cfg ) .
context-free languages have many applications in programming languages , in particular , most arithmetic expressions are generated by context-free grammars .
different context-free grammars can generate the same context-free language .
intrinsic properties of the language can be distinguished from extrinsic properties of a particular grammar by comparing multiple grammars that describe the language .
the set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by pushdown automata , which makes these languages amenable to parsing .
further , for a given cfg , there is a direct way to produce a pushdown automaton for the grammar ( and thereby the corresponding language ) , though going the other way ( producing a grammar given an automaton ) is not as direct .
a model context-free language is formula_1 , the language of all non-empty even-length strings , the entire first halves of which are ' s , and the entire second halves of which are ' s .
is generated by the grammar formula_2 .
this language is not regular .
it is accepted by the pushdown automaton formula_3 where formula_4 is defined as follows : unambiguous cfls are a proper subset of all cfls : there are inherently ambiguous cfls .
an example of an inherently ambiguous cfl is the union of formula_6 with formula_7 .
this set is context-free , since the union of two context-free languages is always context-free .
but there is no way to unambiguously parse strings in the ( non-context-free ) subset formula_8 which is the intersection of these two languages .
the language of all properly matched parentheses is generated by the grammar formula_9 .
the context-free nature of the language makes it simple to parse with a pushdown automaton .
determining an instance of the membership problem ; i .
e .
given a string formula_10 , determine whether formula_11 where formula_12 is the language generated by a given grammar formula_13 ; is also known as " recognition " .
context-free recognition for chomsky normal form grammars was shown by leslie g .
valiant to be reducible to boolean matrix multiplication , thus inheriting its complexity upper bound of " o " ( " n " ) .
conversely , lillian lee has shown " o " ( " n " ) boolean matrix multiplication to be reducible to " o " ( " n " ) cfg parsing , thus establishing some kind of lower bound for the latter .
practical uses of context-free languages require also to produce a derivation tree that exhibits the structure that the grammar associates with the given string .
the process of producing this tree is called " parsing " .
known parsers have a time complexity that is cubic in the size of the string that is parsed .
formally , the set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by pushdown automata ( pda ) .
parser algorithms for context-free languages include the cyk algorithm and earley's algorithm .
a special subclass of context-free languages are the deterministic context-free languages which are defined as the set of languages accepted by a deterministic pushdown automaton and can be parsed by a lr ( k ) parser .
see also parsing expression grammar as an alternative approach to grammar and parser .
context-free languages are closed under the following operations .
that is , if " l " and " p " are context-free languages , the following languages are context-free as well : the context-free languages are not closed under intersection .
this can be seen by taking the languages formula_22 and formula_23 , which are both context-free .
their intersection is formula_24 , which can be shown to be non-context-free by the pumping lemma for context-free languages .
as a consequence , context-free languages cannot be closed under complementation , as for any languages " a " and " b " , their intersection can be expressed by union and complement : formula_25 .
in particular , context-free language cannot be closed under difference , since complement can be expressed by difference : formula_26 .
however , if " l " is a context-free language and " d " is a regular language then both their intersection formula_27 and their difference formula_28 are context-free languages .
in formal language theory , questions about regular languages are usually decidable , but ones about context-free languages are often not .
it is decidable whether such a language is finite , but not whether it contains every possible string , is regular , is unambiguous , or is equivalent to a language with a different grammar .
the following problems are undecidable for arbitrarily given context-free grammars a and b : the following problems are " decidable " for arbitrary context-free languages : according to hopcroft , motwani , ullman ( *num* ) , many of the fundamental closure and ( un ) decidability properties of context-free languages were shown in the *num* paper of bar-hillel , perles , and shamir the set formula_8 is a context-sensitive language , but there does not exist a context-free grammar generating this language .
so there exist context-sensitive languages which are not context-free .
to prove that a given language is not context-free , one may employ the pumping lemma for context-free languages or a number of other methods , such as ogden's lemma or parikh's theorem .
elijah elijah ( ; ; , meaning " my god is yahweh / yhwh " ) or latinized form elias ( ) was , according to the books of kings in the hebrew bible , a prophet and a miracle worker who lived in the northern kingdom of israel during the reign of king ahab ( *ord* century bc ) .
in *num* kings *num* , elijah defended the worship of the hebrew god over that of the canaanite deity baal .
god also performed many miracles through elijah , including resurrection ( raising the dead ) , bringing fire down from the sky , and entering heaven alive " by fire " .
he is also portrayed as leading a school of prophets known as " the sons of the prophets " .
following his ascension , elisha , his disciple and most devoted assistant took over his role as leader of this school .
the book of malachi prophesies elijah's return " before the coming of the great and terrible day of the " , making him a harbinger of the messiah and of the eschaton in various faiths that revere the hebrew bible .
references to elijah appear in ecclesiasticus , the new testament , the mishnah and talmud , the quran , the book of mormon , the doctrine and covenants , and bahá'í writings .
in judaism , elijah's name is invoked at the weekly havdalah rite that marks the end of shabbat , and elijah is invoked in other jewish customs , among them the passover seder and the brit milah ( ritual circumcision ) .
he appears in numerous stories and references in the haggadah and rabbinic literature , including the babylonian talmud .
the christian new testament notes that some people thought that jesus was , in some sense , elijah .
but jesus makes it clear that john the baptist is " the elijah " who was promised to come in malachi *num* : *num* in the septuagint ( malachi *num* : *num* ) .
elijah appears with moses during the transfiguration of jesus .
in islam , elijah appears in the quran as a prophet and messenger of god , where his biblical narrative of preaching against the worshipers of baal is recounted in a concise form .
due to his importance to muslims , catholics and orthodox christians , elijah has been venerated as the patron saint of bosnia and herzegovina since *num* .
according to the bible , by the *ord* century bc , the kingdom of israel , once united under solomon , was divided into the northern kingdom of israel and southern kingdom of judah , which retained the historical capital of jerusalem along with its temple .
however , scholars today are divided as to whether the united kingdom under solomon ever existed .
omri , king of israel , continued policies dating from the reign of jeroboam , contrary to religious law , that were intended to reorient religious focus away from jerusalem : encouraging the building of local temple altars for sacrifices , appointing priests from outside the family of the levites , and allowing or encouraging temples dedicated to baal , an important deity in ancient canaanite religion .
omri achieved domestic security with a marriage alliance between his son ahab and princess jezebel , a priestess of baal and the daughter of the king of sidon in phoenicia .
these solutions brought security and economic prosperity to israel for a time , but did not bring peace with the israelite prophets , who were interested in a strict deuteronomic interpretation of the religious law .
under ahab's kingship , these tensions were exacerbated .
ahab built a temple for baal , and his wife jezebel brought a large entourage of priests and prophets of baal and asherah into the country .
it is in this context that elijah is introduced in as elijah " the tishbite " .
he warns ahab that there will be years of catastrophic drought so severe that not even dew will form , because ahab and his queen stand at the end of a line of kings of israel who are said to have " done evil in the sight of the lord .
" no background for the person of elijah is given except for his brief description as being a " tishbite .
" his name in hebrew means " my god is yahweh " , and may be a title applied to him because of his challenge to worship of baal .
as told in the hebrew bible , elijah's challenge is bold and direct .
baal was the canaanite god responsible for rain , thunder , lightning , and dew .
elijah not only challenges baal on behalf of god himself , but he also challenges jezebel , her priests , ahab and the people of israel .
after elijah's confrontation with ahab , god tells him to flee out of israel , to a hiding place by the brook chorath , east of the jordan , where he will be fed by ravens .
when the brook dries up , god sends him to a widow living in the town of zarephath in phoenicia .
when elijah finds her and asks to be fed , she says that she does not have sufficient food to keep her and her own son alive .
elijah tells her that god will not allow her supply of flour or oil to run out , saying , " do not be afraid .
.
.
for thus says the lord the god of israel : the jar of meal will not be emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the lord sends rain on the earth .
" she feeds him the last of their food , and elijah's promise miraculously comes true .
god gave her " manna " from heaven even while he was withholding food from his unfaithful people in the promised land .
some time later the widow's son dies and the widow cries , " you have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance , and to cause the death of my son ! " elijah prays that god might restore her son so that the trustworthiness of god's word might be demonstrated .
*num* kings *num* : *num* relates how god " listened to the voice of elijah ; the life of the child came into him again , and he revived .
" this is the first instance of raising the dead recorded in scripture .
this widow was granted the life of her son , the only hope for a widow in ancient society .
the widow cried , " .
.
.
the word of the lord in your mouth is truth .
" .
after more than three years of drought and famine , god tells elijah to return to ahab and announce the end of the drought : not occasioned by repentance in israel but by the command of the lord , who had determined to reveal himself again to his people .
while on his way , elijah meets obadiah , the head of ahab's household , who had hidden a hundred jewish prophets when ahab and jezebel had been killing them .
elijah sends obadiah back to ahab to announce his return to israel .
when ahab confronts elijah , he refers to him as the " troubler of israel .
" elijah responds by throwing the charge back at ahab , saying that it is ahab who has troubled israel by allowing the worship of false gods .
elijah then berates both the people of israel and ahab for their acquiescence in baal worship .
" how long will you go limping with two different opinions ? if the lord is god , follow him ; but if baal , then follow him .
" and the people were silent .
the hebrew for this word , " go limping " or " waver " , is the same as that used for " danced " in *num* kings *num* , verse *num* , where the prophets of baal frantically dance .
elijah speaks with sharp irony about the religious ambivalence of israel .
elijah proposes a direct test of the powers of baal and the jewish god .
the people of israel , *num* prophets of baal , and *num* prophets of asherah are summoned to mount carmel .
an altar is built for baal .
wood is laid on the altar .
an ox is slaughtered and cut into pieces ; the pieces are laid on the wood .
elijah then invites the priests of baal to pray for fire to light the sacrifice .
they pray from morning to noon without success .
elijah ridicules their efforts .
" at noon elijah mocked them , saying , ' cry aloud ! surely he is a god ; either he is meditating , or he has wandered away , or he is on a journey , or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened .
' " they respond by cutting themselves and adding their own blood to the sacrifice ( such mutilation of the body was strictly forbidden in the mosaic law ) .
they continue praying until evening without success .
elijah builds an altar from twelve stones , he digs a huge trench around it , he lays the wood on it , slaughters the ox cuts it up and lays it on the wood , he now orders that the sacrifice and altar be drenched with water from " four large jars " poured three times , filling also the trench .
he asks god to accept the sacrifice .
fire falls from the sky , consuming the sacrifice , the stones of the altar itself , the earth and the water in the trench as well .
elijah then orders the deaths of the priests of baal .
elijah prays earnestly for rain to fall again on the land .
then the rains begin , signaling the end of the famine .
jezebel , enraged that elijah had ordered the deaths of her priests , threatens to kill elijah .
later elijah would prophesize about jezebel's death , because of her sin .
elijah flees to beersheba in judah , continues alone into the wilderness , and finally sits down under a shrub , praying for death .
he falls asleep under the tree ; the angel of the lord touches him and tells him to wake up and eat .
when he awakens he finds bread and a jar of water .
he eats , drinks , and goes back to sleep .
the angel comes a second time and tells him to eat and drink because he has a long journey ahead of him .
elijah travels for forty days and forty nights to mount horeb , where moses had received the ten commandments .
elijah is the only person described in the bible as returning to horeb , after moses and his generation had left horeb several centuries before .
he seeks shelter in a cave .
god again speaks to elijah : " what doest thou here , elijah ? " .
elijah did not give a direct answer to the lord's question but evades and equivocates , implying that the work the lord had begun centuries earlier had now come to nothing , and that his own work was fruitless .
unlike moses , who tried to defend israel when they sinned with the golden calf , elijah bitterly complains over the israelites ' unfaithfulness and says he is the " only one left " .
up until this time elijah has only the word of god to guide him , but now he is told to go outside the cave and " stand before the lord .
" a terrible wind passes , but god is not in the wind .
a great earthquake shakes the mountain , but god is not in the earthquake .
then a fire passes the mountain , but god is not in the fire .
then a " still small voice " comes to elijah and asks again , " what doest thou here , elijah ? " elijah again evades the question and his lament is unrevised , showing that he did not understand the importance of the divine revelation he had just witnessed .
god then sends him out again , this time to damascus to anoint hazael as king of aram , jehu as king of israel , and elisha as his replacement .
elijah encounters ahab again in , after ahab has acquired possession of a vineyard by murder .
ahab desires to have the vineyard of naboth of jezreel .
he offers a better vineyard or a fair price for the land .
but naboth tells ahab that god has told him not to part with the land .
ahab accepts this answer with sullen bad grace .
jezebel , however , plots a method for acquiring the land .
she sends letters , in ahab's name , to the elders and nobles who lived near naboth .
they are to arrange a feast and invite naboth .
at the feast , false charges of cursing god and ahab are to be made against him .
the plot is carried out and naboth is stoned to death .
when word comes that naboth is dead , jezebel tells ahab to take possession of the vineyard .
god again speaks to elijah and sends him to confront ahab with a question and a prophecy : " have you killed , and also taken possession ? " and , " in the place where dogs licked up the blood of naboth , dogs will also lick up your blood .
" ahab begins the confrontation by calling elijah his enemy .
elijah responds by throwing the charge back at him , telling him that he has made himself the enemy of god by his own actions .
elijah then goes beyond the prophecy he was given and tells ahab that his entire kingdom will reject his authority ; that jezebel will be eaten by dogs within jezreel ; and that his family will be consumed by dogs as well ( if they die in a city ) or by birds ( if they die in the country ) .
when ahab hears this he repents to such a degree that god relents in punishing ahab but will punish jezebel and their son : ahaziah .
elijah's story continues now from ahab to an encounter with ahaziah .
the scene opens with ahaziah seriously injured in a fall .
he sends to the priests of baalzebub in ekron , outside the kingdom of israel , to know if he will recover .
elijah intercepts his messengers and sends them back to ahaziah with a message " is it because there is no god in israel that you are sending to inquire of baal-zebub , the god of ekron ? " ahaziah asks the messengers to describe the person who gave them this message .
they tell him he was a hairy man with a leather belt around his waist and he instantly recognizes the description as elijah the tishbite .
ahaziah sends out three groups of soldiers to arrest elijah .
the first two are destroyed by fire which elijah calls down from heaven .
the leader of the third group asks for mercy for himself and his men .
elijah agrees to accompany this third group to ahaziah , where he gives his prophecy in person .
ahaziah dies without recovering from his injuries in accordance with elijah's word .
according to , elisha ( eliseus ) and " the sons of the prophets " knew beforehand that elijah would one day be assumed into heaven .
elisha asked elijah to " let a double portion " of elijah's " spirit " be upon him .
elijah agreed , with the condition that elisha would see him be " taken " .
elijah , in company with elisha , approaches the jordan .
he rolls up his mantle and strikes the water .
the water immediately divides and elijah and elisha cross on dry land .
suddenly , a chariot of fire and horses of fire appear and elijah is lifted up in a whirlwind .
as elijah is lifted up , his mantle falls to the ground and elisha picks it up .
elijah is mentioned once more in , which will be his final mention in the hebrew bible .
a letter is sent under the prophet's name to jehoram of judah .
it tells him that he has led the people of judah astray in the same way that israel was led astray .
the prophet ends the letter with a prediction of a painful death .
this letter is a puzzle to readers for several reasons .
first , it concerns a king of the southern kingdom , while elijah concerned himself with the kingdom of israel .
second , the message begins with " thus says yhvh , god of your father david .
.
.
" rather than the more usual " .
.
.
in the name of yhvh the god of israel .
" also , this letter seems to come after elijah's ascension into the whirlwind .
michael wilcock , formerly of trinity college , bristol , suggests a number of possible reasons for this letter , among them that it may be an example of a better known prophet's name being substituted for that of a lesser known prophet .
john van seters , however , rejects the letter as having any connection with the elijah tradition .
however , wilcock argues that elijah's letter , ' does address a very ' northern ' situation in the southern kingdom ' , and thus is authentic .
while the final mention of elijah in the hebrew bible is in the book of chronicles , the christian bible's ordering of the books of the septuagint places the book of malachi , which prophesies a messiah , before the gospels and means that elijah's final old testament appearance is in the book of malachi , where it is written , " lo , i will send you the prophet elijah before the great and terrible day of the lord comes .
" that day is described as the burning of a great furnace , " .
.
.
so that it will leave them neither root nor branch .
" in christianity it is traditionally believed that elijah's appearance during the transfiguration of jesus fulfilled this prophecy .
moreover , in the gospel of matthew , jesus identifies john the baptist as the spiritual successor to elijah : " and if you are willing to accept it , he is elijah who is to come .
" finally , the verses in malachi are believed to indicate that elijah has a role in the end-times , immediately before the second coming of jesus .
members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints believe that elijah visited earth at the dedication of the kirtland temple .
according to susanne otto , the elijah stories were added to the deuteronomistic history in four stages .
the first stage dates from the final edition of the history , about *num* bc , when the three stories of naboth's vineyard , the death of ahaziah , and the story of jehu's coup were included to embody the themes of the reliability of god's word and the cycle of baal worship and religious reform in the history of the northern kingdom .
the narratives about the omride wars were added shortly afterwards to illustrate a newly introduced theme , that the attitude of the king towards god determines the fate of israel .
according to otto , was added in early post-exilic times ( after *num* bc ) to demonstrate the possibility of a new life in community with god after the time of judgment .
additionally , otto suggests that in the fifth century bc , and the remaining elisha stories were inserted to give prophecy a legitimate foundation in the history of israel .
the foregoing otto analysis is heavily disputed amongst biblical scholars .
jewish legends about elijah abound in the aggadah , which is found throughout various collections of rabbinic literature , including the babylonian talmud .
this varied literature does not merely discuss his life , but has created a new history of him , which , beginning with his death or " translation " ends only with the close of the history of the human race .
the volume of references to elijah in jewish tradition stands in marked contrast to that in the canon .
as in the case of most figures of jewish legend , so in the case of elijah , the biblical account became the basis of later legend .
elijah the precursor of the messiah , elijah zealous in the cause of god , elijah the helper in distress : these are the three leading notes struck by the aggadah , endeavoring to complete the biblical picture with the elijah legends .
his career is extensive , colorful , and varied .
he has appeared the world over in the guise of a beggar and scholar .
from the time of malachi , who says of elijah that god will send him before " the great and dreadful day " ( mal .
*num* : *num* ) , down to the later stories of the chasidic rabbis , reverence and love , expectation and hope , were always connected in the jewish consciousness with elijah .
three different theories regarding elijah's origin are presented in the aggadah literature : ( *num* ) he belonged to the tribe of gad , ( *num* ) he was a benjamite from jerusalem , identical with the elijah mentioned in i chronicles *num* : *num* , and ( *num* ) he was a priest .
many christian church fathers also have stated that elijah was a priest .
some rabbis have speculated that he should be identified with phinehas .
according to later kabbalistic literature , elijah was really an angel in human form , so that he had neither parents nor offspring .
the midrash rabbah exodus *num* : *num* states " elijah should have revived his parents as he had revived the son of the zarephathite " indicating he surely had parents .
the talmud states " said he [ rabbah ] to him ( elijah ) : art thou not a priest : why then dost thou stand in a cemetery ? " in spite of elijah's many miracles , the mass of the jewish people remained as godless as before .
a midrash tells that they even abolished the sign of the covenant , and the prophet had to appear as israel's accuser before god .
in the same cave where god once appeared to moses and revealed himself as gracious and merciful , elijah was summoned to appear before god .
by this summons he perceived that he should have appealed to god's mercy , instead of becoming israel's accuser .
the prophet , however , remained relentless in his zeal and severity , so that god commanded him to appoint his successor .
the vision in which god revealed himself to elijah gave him at the same time a picture of the destinies of man , who has to pass through " four worlds .
" this world was shown to the prophet by god through symbolism : in the form of the wind , since the world disappears as the wind ; storm is the day of death , before which man trembles ; fire is the judgment in gehenna ; and the stillness is the last day .
three years after this vision , elijah was " translated .
" concerning the place to which elijah was transferred , opinions differ among jews and christians , but the old view was that elijah was received among the heavenly inhabitants , where he records the deeds of men .
but as early as the middle of the *ord* century , when the notion of translation to heaven underwent divergent possible interpretations by christian theologians , the assertion was made that elijah never entered into heaven proper .
in later literature paradise is generally designated as the abode of elijah , but since the location of paradise is itself uncertain , the last two statements may be identical .
in the wisdom of jesus ben sira ( ) his tasks are altered to : *num* ) herald the eschaton , *num* ) calm god's fury , *num* ) restore familial peace , and *num* ) restore the *num* tribes .
at jewish circumcision ceremonies , a chair is set aside for the use of the prophet elijah .
elijah is said to be a witness at all circumcisions when the sign of the covenant is placed upon the body of the child .
this custom stems from the incident at mount horeb ( ) : elijah had arrived at mount horeb after the demonstration of god's presence and power on mount carmel .
( ) god asks elijah to explain his arrival , and elijah replies : " i have been very jealous for the lord , the god of hosts ; for the people of israel have forsaken thy covenant , thrown down thy altars , and slain thy prophets with the sword ; and i , even i only , am left ; and they seek my life , to take it away " ( ) .
according to rabbinic tradition , elijah's words were patently untrue ( and ) , and since elijah accused israel of failing to uphold the covenant , god would require elijah to be present at every covenant of circumcision .
in the talmudic literature , elijah would visit rabbis to help solve particularly difficult legal problems .
malachi had cited elijah as the harbinger of the eschaton .
thus , when confronted with reconciling impossibly conflicting laws or rituals , the rabbis would set aside any decision " until elijah comes .
" one such decision was whether the passover seder required four or five cups of wine .
each serving of wine corresponds to one of the " four expressions of redemption " in the book of exodus : i am the lord , and " i will bring you out " from under the burdens of the egyptians , and " i will deliver you " from their bondage , and " i will redeem you " with an out-stretched arm and with great acts of judgment , and " i will take you " for my people , and i will be your god ; and you shall know that i am the lord your god , who has brought you out from under the burdens of the egyptians " ( ) .
the next verse , " and " i will bring you " into the land which i swore to give to abraham , to isaac , and to jacob ; i will give it to you for a possession .
i am the lord .
" ( ) was not fulfilled until the generation following the passover story , and the rabbis could not decide whether this verse counted as part of the passover celebration ( thus deserving of another serving of wine ) .
thus , a cup was left for the arrival of elijah .
in practice the fifth cup has come to be seen as a celebration of future redemption .
today , a place is reserved at the seder table and a cup of wine is placed there for elijah .
during the seder , the door of the house is opened and elijah is invited in .
traditionally , the cup is viewed as elijah's and is used for no other purpose .
havdalah is the ceremony that concludes the sabbath day ( saturday evening in jewish tradition ) .
as part of the concluding hymn , an appeal is made to god that elijah will come during the following week .
" elijah the prophet , elijah the tishbite .
let him come quickly , in our day with the messiah , the son of david .
" the volume of references to elijah in folklore stands in marked contrast to that in the canon .
elijah's miraculous transferral to heaven led to speculation as to his true identity .
louis ginzberg equates him with phinehas the grandson of aaron ( ) .
because of phinehas ' zealousness for god , he and his descendants were promised , " a covenant of lasting priesthood " ( ) .
therefore , elijah is a priest as well as a prophet .
elijah is also equated with the archangel sandalphon , whose four wing beats will carry him to any part of the earth .
when forced to choose between death and dishonor , rabbi kahana chose to leap to his death .
before he could strike the ground , elijah / sandalphon had appeared to catch him .
yet another name for elijah is " angel of the covenant" references to elijah in jewish folklore range from short observations ( e .
g .
it is said that when dogs are happy for no reason , it is because elijah is in the neighborhood ) to lengthy parables on the nature of god's justice .
one such story is that of rabbi joshua ben levi .
the rabbi , a friend of elijah's , was asked what favor he might wish .
the rabbi answered only that he be able to join elijah in his wanderings .
elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophet's actions .
he agreed and they began their journey .
the first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow .
the old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could .
the next morning , as the travelers left , elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did .
the second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man .
he had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people .
as they were leaving , they passed the man's wall and saw that it was crumbling .
elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so .
next , they came to a wealthy synagogue .
they were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions .
when they left , elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader .
finally , they came to a very poor synagogue .
here they were treated with great courtesy and hospitality .
when they left , elijah prayed that god might give them a single wise leader .
at this rabbi joshua could no longer hold back .
he demanded of elijah an explanation of his actions .
at the house of the old couple , elijah knew that the angel of death was coming for the old woman .
so he prayed that god might have the angel take the cow instead .
at the house of the wealthy man , there was a great treasure hidden in the crumbling wall .
elijah prayed that the wall be restored thus keeping the treasure away from the miser .
the story ends with a moral : a synagogue with many leaders will be ruined by many arguments .
a town with a single wise leader will be guided to success and prosperity .
" know then , that if thou seest an evil-doer prosper , it is not always unto his advantage , and if a righteous man suffers need and distress , think not god is unjust .
" the elijah of legend did not lose any of his ability to afflict the comfortable .
the case of rabbi eliezer son of rabbi simon ben yohai is illustrative .
once , when walking a beach , he came upon a hideously ugly man—the prophet in disguise .
the man greeted him courteously , " peace be with thee , rabbi .
" instead of returning the greeting , the rabbi could not resist an insult , " how ugly you are ! is there anyone as ugly as you in your town ? " elijah responded with , " i don't know .
perhaps you should tell the master architect how ugly is this , his construction .
" the rabbi realized his wrong and asked for pardon .
but elijah would not give it until the entire city had asked for forgiveness for the rabbi and the rabbi had promised to mend his ways .
elijah was always seen as deeply pious , it seems only natural that he would be pitted against an equally evil individual .
this was found in the person of lilith .
lilith in legend was the first wife of adam .
she rebelled against adam , the angels , and even god .
she came to be seen as a demon and a witch .
elijah encountered lilith and instantly recognized and challenged her , " unclean one , where are you going ? " unable to avoid or lie to the prophet , she admitted she was on her way to the house of a pregnant woman .
her intention was to kill the woman and eat the child .
elijah pronounced his malediction , " i curse you in the name of the lord .
be silent as a stone ! " but , lilith was able to make a bargain with elijah .
she promises to " forsake my evil ways " if elijah will remove his curse .
to seal the bargain she gives elijah her names so that they can be posted in the houses of pregnant women or new born children or used as amulets .
lilith promises , " where i see those names , i shall run away at once .
neither the child nor the mother will ever be injured by me .
" in the new testament , jesus would say for those who believed , john the baptist was elijah , who would come before the " great and terrible day " as predicted by malachi .
some english translations of the new testament use elias , a latin form of the name .
in the king james version , " elias " appears only in the texts translated from greek .
john the baptist preached a message of repentance and baptism .
he predicted the day of judgment using imagery similar to that of malachi .
he also preached that the messiah was coming .
all of this was done in a style that immediately recalled the image of elijah to his audience .
he wore a coat of camel's hair secured with a leather girdle ( , ) .
he also frequently preached in wilderness areas near the jordan river .
in the gospel of john , when john the baptist was asked by a delegation of priests ( present tense ) " art thou elias " , he replied " i am not " ( ) .
and however , make it clear that john was the spiritual successor to elijah .
in the nativity of st .
john the baptist in luke , gabriel appears to zechariah , john's father , and told him that john " will turn many of the sons of israel to the lord their god , " and that he will go forth " in the spirit and power of elijah " ( ) .
in the gospel of luke , herod antipas hears some of the stories surrounding jesus christ .
some tell herod that jesus is john the baptist ( whom herod had executed ) come back to life .
others tell him that jesus is elijah .
later in the same gospel , jesus asks his disciples who the people say that he is .
the apostles ' answer includes elijah among others .
however jesus ' ministry had little in common with that of elijah ; in particular , he preached the forgiveness of one's enemies , while elijah killed his .
miracle stories similar to those of elijah were associated with jesus ( e .
g .
raising of the dead , miraculous feeding ) .
jesus implicitly separates himself from elijah when he rebukes james and john for desiring to call down fire upon an unwelcoming samaritan village in a similar manner to elijah .
likewise , jesus rebukes a potential follower who wanted first to return home to say farewell to his family , whereas elijah permitted this of his replacement elisha .
during jesus ' crucifixion , some of the onlookers wonder if elijah will come to rescue him , as by the time of jesus , elijah had entered folklore as a rescuer of jews in distress .
elijah makes an appearance in the new testament during an incident known as the transfiguration .
at the summit of an unnamed mount , jesus ' face begins to shine .
the disciples who are with him hear the voice of god announce that jesus is " my beloved son .
" the disciples also see moses and elijah appear and talk with jesus .
peter is so struck by the experience that he asks jesus if they should build three " tabernacles " : one for elijah , one for jesus and one for moses .
there is agreement among some christian theologians that elijah appears to hand over the responsibility of the prophets to jesus as the woman by the well said to jesus ( john *num* : *num* ) " i perceive thou art a prophet .
" moses also likewise came to hand over the responsibility of the law for the divinely announced son of god .
elijah is mentioned four more times in the new testament : in luke , romans , hebrews , and james .
in , jesus uses elijah as an example of rejected prophets .
jesus says , " no prophet is accepted in his own country , " and then mentions elijah , saying that there were many widows in israel , but elijah was sent to one in phoenicia .
in , paul cites elijah as an example of god's never forsaking his people ( the israelites ) .
( " women received their dead raised to life again .
.
.
" ) refers to both elijah raising the son of the widow of zarephath and elisha raising the son of the woman of shunem , citing both elijah and elisha as old testament examples of faith .
in , james says , " the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much , " and then cites elijah's prayers which started and ended the famine in israel as examples .
in western christianity , the prophet elijah is commemorated as a saint with a feast day on *num* july by the roman catholic church and the lutheran church–missouri synod .
catholics believe that he was unmarried and celibate .
in the eastern orthodox church and those eastern catholic churches which follow the byzantine rite , he is commemorated on the same date ( in the *ord* century , julian calendar *num* july corresponds to gregorian calendar *num* august ) .
he is greatly revered among the orthodox as a model of the contemplative life .
he is also commemorated on the orthodox liturgical calendar on the sunday of the holy fathers ( the sunday before the nativity of the lord ) .
elijah has been venerated as the patron saint of bosnia and herzegovina since *num* august *num* , replacing george of lydda at the request of bishop pavao dragičević .
the reasons for the replacement are unclear .
it has been suggested that elijah was chosen because of his importance to all three main religious groups in bosnia and herzegovina—catholics , muslims and orthodox christians .
pope benedict xiv is said to have approved bishop dragičević's request with the remark that a wild nation deserved a wild patron .
elijah is revered as the spiritual father and traditional founder of the catholic religious order of carmelites .
in addition to taking their name from mt .
carmel where the first hermits of the order established themselves , the calced carmelite and discalced carmelite traditions pertaining to elijah focus upon the prophet's withdrawal from public life .
the medieval carmelite book of the first monks offers some insight into the heart of the orders ' contemplative vocation and reverence for the prophet .
in the *ord* century the bollandist society , whose declared aim was to search out and classify materials concerning the saints venerated by the church , and to print what seemed to be the most reliable sources of information entered into controversy with the carmelites on this point .
in writing of st .
albert , patriarch of jerusalem and author of the carmelite rule , the bollandist daniel papebroch stated that the attribution of carmelite origin to elijah was insufficiently grounded .
the carmelites reacted strongly .
from *num* to *num* a series of letters , pamphlets and other documents was issued by each side .
the carmelites were supported by a spanish tribunal , while the bollandists had the support of jean de launoy and the sorbonne .
in november *num* , pope innocent xii ordered an end to the controversy .
since most eastern churches either use greek as their liturgical language or translated their liturgies from the greek , " elias " ( or its modern iotacized form " ilias " ) is the form of the prophet's name used among most members of the eastern orthodox church and those eastern catholic churches which follow the byzantine rite .
the feast day of saint elias falls on july *num* of the orthodox liturgical calendar ( for those churches which follow the traditional julian calendar , july *num* currently falls on august *num* of the modern gregorian calendar ) .
this day is a major holiday in lebanon and is one of a handful of holidays there whose celebration is accompanied by a launching of fireworks by the general public .
the full name of st .
elias in lebanon translates to st .
elias the living because it is believed that he did not die but rode his fiery chariot to heaven .
the reference to the fiery chariot is likely why the lebanese celebrate this holiday with fireworks .
elias is also commemorated , together with all of the righteous persons of the old testament , on the sunday of the holy fathers ( the sunday before the nativity of the lord ) .
the apolytikion in the fourth tone for st .
elias : the incarnate angel , the cornerstone of the prophets , the second forerunner of the coming of christ , the glorious elias , who from above , sent down to elisha the grace to dispel sickness and cleanse lepers , abounds therefore in healing for those who honor him .
the kontakion in the second tone for st .
elias : o prophet and foreseer of the great works of god , o greatly renowned elias , who by your word held back the clouds of rain , intercede for us to the only loving one .
starting in the fifth century , elias is often connected with helios , the sun .
the two words have very similar pronunciations in post-classical greek ; elijah rode in his chariot of fire to heaven ( ) just as helios drove the chariot of the sun across the sky ; and the holocaust sacrifice offered by elijah and burned by fire from heaven ( ) corresponds to the sun warming the earth .
sedulius writes poetically in the fifth century that the " bright path to glittering heaven " suits elias both " in merits and name " , as changing one letter makes his name " helios " ; but he does not identify the two .
a homily entitled " de ascensione heliae " , misattributed to chrysostom , claims that poets and painters use the ascension of elijah as a model for their depictions of the sun , and says that " elijah is really helios " .
saint patrick appears to conflate helios and elias .
in modern times , much greek folklore also connects elias with the sun .
in greece , chapels and monasteries dedicated to prophet elias ( προφήτης ηλίας ) are often found on mountaintops , which themselves are often named after him .
since wachsmuth ( *num* ) , the usual explanation for this has been that elias was identified with helios , who had mountaintop shrines .
but few shrines of helios were on mountaintops , and sun-worship was subsumed by apollo-worship by christian times , and so could not be confused with elias .
the modern folklore is not good evidence for the " origin " of the association of the sun , elias , and mountaintops .
perhaps elias is simply a " natural patron of high places " .
the association of elias with mountaintops seems to come from a different pagan tradition : elias took on the attributes and the locales associated with zeus , especially his associations with mountains and his powers over rain , thunder , lighting , and wind .
when elias prevailed over the priests of baal , it was on mount carmel ( ) , which later became known as mount st .
elias .
when he spent forty days in a cave , it was on mount horeb ( ) .
when elias confronted ahab , he stopped the rains for three years ( ) .
a map of mountain-cults of zeus shows that most of these sites are now dedicated to elias , including mount olympus , mount lykaion , mount arachnaion , and mount taleton on the mainland , and mount kenaion , mount oche , and mount kynados in the islands .
of these , the only one with a recorded tradition of a helios cult is mount taleton .
elias is associated with pre-christian lightning gods in many other european traditions .
among albanians , pilgrimages are made to mountaintops to ask for rain during the summer .
one such tradition that is gaining popularity is the *num* august pilgrimage to ljuboten on the sharr mountains .
muslims refer to this day as " aligjyn " ( " ali day " ) , and it is believed that ali becomes elias at midday .
as elijah was described as ascending into heaven in a fiery chariot , the christian missionaries who converted slavic tribes likely found him an ideal analogy for perun , the supreme slavic god of storms , thunder and lightning bolts .
in many slavic countries elijah is known as elijah the thunderer ( " ilija gromovnik " ) , who drives the heavens in a chariot and administers rain and snow , thus actually taking the place of perun in popular beliefs .
perun is also sometimes conflated with the legendary hero elijah of murom .
the feast of st .
elias is known as " ilinden " in south slavic , and was chosen as the day of the ilinden-preobrazhenie uprising in *num* ; it is now the holiday of republic day in north macedonia .
in estonian folklore elijah is considered to be the successor of ukko , the lightning spirit .
in georgian mythology , he replaces elwa .
a georgian story about elijah : once jesus , the prophet elijah , and st .
george were going through georgia .
when they became tired and hungry they stopped to dine .
they saw a georgian shepherd and decided to ask him to feed them .
first , elijah went up to the shepherd and asked him for a sheep .
after the shepherd asked his identity elijah said that , he was the one who sent him rain to get him a good profit from farming .
the shepherd became angry at him and told him that he was the one who also sent thunderstorms , which destroyed the farms of poor widows .
( after elijah , jesus and st .
george attempt to get help and eventually succeed ) .
elias has other pagan associations : a modern legend about elias mirrors precisely the legend of odysseus seeking a place where the locals would not recognize an oar—hence the mountaintops .
the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints acknowledges elijah as a prophet .
the church teaches that the malachi prophecy of the return of elijah was fulfilled on april *num* , *num* , when elijah visited the prophet and founder of the church , joseph smith , along with oliver cowdery , in the kirtland temple as a resurrected being .
this event is chronicled in .
this experience forms the basis for the church's focus on genealogy and family history and belief in the eternal nature of marriage and families .
in latter-day saint theology , the name-title elias is not always synonymous with elijah and is often used for people other than the biblical prophet .
according to joseph smith , the spirit of elias is first , elijah second , and messiah last .
elias is a forerunner to prepare the way , and the spirit and power of elijah is to come after , holding the keys of power , building the temple to the capstone , placing the seals of the melchizedek priesthood upon the house of israel , and making all things ready ; then messiah comes to his temple , which is last of all .
people to whom the title elias is applied in mormonism include noah , the angel gabriel ( who is considered to be the same person as noah in mormon doctrine ) , elijah , john the baptist , john the apostle , and an unspecified man who was a contemporary of abraham .
detractors of mormonism have often alleged that smith , in whose time and place the king james version was the only available english translation of the bible , simply failed to grasp the fact that the elijah of the old testament and the elias of the new testament are the same person .
latter-day saints deny this and say that the difference they make between the two is deliberate and prophetic .
the names elias and elijah refer to one who prepares the way for the coming of the lord .
this is applicable to john the baptist coming to prepare the way for the lord and his baptism ; it also refers to elijah appearing during the transfiguration to prepare for jesus by restoring keys of sealing power .
jesus then gave this power to the twelve saying , " verily i say unto you , whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
" elijah ( or ; " ilyas " or " ilya " ) is also mentioned as a prophet in the qur'an , al-an'am *num* .
elijah's narrative in the qur'an and later muslim tradition resembles closely that in the hebrew bible and muslim literature records elijah's primary prophesying as taking place during the reign of ahab and jezebel as well as ahaziah .
he is seen by muslims to be the prophetic predecessor to elisha .
while neither the bible nor the qur'an mentions the genealogy of elijah , some scholars of islam believe he may have come from the priestly family of the prophet aaron .
elijah is rarely associated with islamic eschatology and islam views jesus as the messiah .
however , elijah is expected to come back along with the mysterious figure known as khidr during the last judgment .
elijah's figure has been identified with a number of other prophets and saints , including idris , which is believed by some scholars to have been another name for elijah , and khidr .
islamic legend later developed the figure of elijah , greatly embellishing upon his attributes , and some apocryphal literature gave elijah the status of a half-human , half-angel .
elijah also appears in later works of literature , including the " hamzanama " .
elijah is mentioned in the quran , where his preaching is recounted in a concise manner .
the quran narrates that elijah told his people to come to the worship of god and to leave the worship of baal , the primary idol of the area .
the quran states , " verily elijah was one of the apostles .
when he said to his people : " will you not fear god ? " will ye call upon ba'al and leave the best of creators , god , your and cherisher and the and cherisher of your fathers of old ? " as-saaffat 123–126 the quran makes it clear that the majority of elijah's people denied the prophet and continued to follow idolatry .
however , it mentions that a small number of devoted servants of god among them followed elijah and believed in and worshiped god .
the quran states , " they denied him ( elijah ) , and will surely be brought to punishment , except the sincere and devoted servants of god ( among them ) .
and we left his ( memory ) for posterity .
" as-saaffat 127–128 in the quran , god praises elijah in two places : numerous commentators , including abdullah yusuf ali , have offered commentary on vi : *num* saying that elijah , zechariah , john the baptist and jesus were all spiritually connected .
abdullah yusuf ali says , " the third group consists not of men of action , but preachers of truth , who led solitary lives .
their epithet is : " the righteous .
" they form a connected group round jesus .
zachariah was the father of john the baptist , who is referenced as " elias , which was for to come " ( matt *num* : *num* ) ; and elias is said to have been present and talked to jesus at the transfiguration on the mount ( matt .
*num* : *num* ) .
" muslim literature and tradition recounts that elijah preached to the kingdom of israel , ruled over by ahab and later his son ahaziah .
he is believed to have been a " prophet of the desert—like john the baptist " .
elijah is believed to have preached with zeal to ahab and his wife jezebel , who according to muslim tradition was partly responsible for the worship of false idols in this area .
muslims believe that it was because the majority of people refused to listen to elijah that elisha had to continue preaching the message of god to israel after him .
elijah has been the subject of legends and folktales in muslim culture , usually involving his meeting with khidr , and in one legend , with muhammad himself .
in islamic mysticism , elijah is associated closely with the sage khidr .
one hadith reported that elijah and khidr met together every year in jerusalem to go on the pilgrimage to mecca .
elijah appears also in the " hamzanama " numerous times , where he is spoken of as being the brother of khidr as well as one who drank from the fountain of youth .
further , it is narrated in kitab al-kafi that imam ja'far al-sadiq was reciting the prostration of ilyas ( elijah ) in the syrian language and began to weep .
he then translated the supplication in arabic to a group of visiting scholars : "o lord , will i find that you punish me although you know of my thirst in the heat of midday ? will i find that you punish me although you know that i rub my face on earth to worship you ? will i find that you punish me although you know that i give up sins for you ? will i find that you punish me although you know that i stay awake all night just for you ? " to which allah then inspired to ilyas , " raise your head from the earth for i will not punish you " .
/ although most muslim scholars believed that elijah preached in israel , some early commentators on the qur'an stated that elijah was sent to baalbek , in lebanon .
modern scholars have rejected this claim , stating that the connection of the city with elijah would have been made because of the first half of the city's name , that of " baal " , which was the deity that elijah exhorted his people to stop worshiping .
scholars who reject identification of elijah's town with baalbek further argue that the town of baalbek is not mentioned with the narrative of elijah in either the qur'an or the hebrew bible .
in the bahá'í faith , the báb , founder of the bábí faith , is believed to be the return of elijah and john the baptist .
both elijah and john the baptist are considered to be lesser prophets , whose stations are below that of a manifestation of god like jesus christ , buddha , the báb or bahá'u'lláh .
the báb is buried on mount carmel , where elijah had his confrontation with the prophets of baal .
that " ravens " fed elijah by the brook chorath has been questioned .
the hebrew text at uses the word " `ōrvīm " , which means " ravens " , but with a different vocalization might equally mean " arabs " .
the septuagint has , " ravens " , and other traditional translations followed .
alternatives have been proposed for many years ; for example adam clarke ( d .
*num* ) treated it as a discussion already of long standing .
objections to the traditional translation are that ravens are ritually unclean ( see ) as well as physically dirty ; it is difficult to imagine any method of delivery of the food which is not disgusting .
the parallelism with the incident that follows , where elijah is fed by the widow , also suggests a human , if mildly improbable , agent .
prof .
john gray chooses " arabs " , saying " we adopt this reading solely because of its congruity with the sequel , where elijah is fed by an alien phoenician woman .
" his translation of the verses in question is : and the word of jehovah came to elijah saying , go hence and turn eastward and hide thyself in the wadi chorath east of the jordan , and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the wadi , and i have commanded the arabs to feed thee there .
and he went and did according to the word of jehovah and went and dwelt in the wadi chorath east of the jordan .
and the arabs brought him bread in the morning and flesh in the evening and he would drink of the wadi .
in the gospel of john , jesus says : " and no man hath ascended up to heaven , but he that came down from heaven , " [ even ] " the son of man which is in heaven .
" ( john *num* : *num* ) traditionally christianity interprets the " son of man " as a title of jesus , but this has never been an article of faith and there are other interpretations .
further interpreting this quote , some christians believe that elijah was not assumed into heaven but simply transferred to another assignment either in heaven or with king jehoram of judah .
the prophets reacted in such a way that makes sense if he was carried away , and not simply straight up ( ) .
the question of whether elijah was in heaven or elsewhere on earth depends partly on the view of the letter jehoram received from elijah in *num* chronicles *num* after elijah had ascended .
some have suggested that the letter was written before elijah ascended , but only delivered later .
the rabbinical seder olam explains that the letter was delivered seven years after his ascension .
this is also a possible explanation for some variation in manuscripts of josephus ' " antiquities of the jews " when dealing with this issue .
others have argued that elijah was only " caught away " such as philip in acts *num* : *num* john lightfoot reasoned that it must have been a different elijah .
elijah's name typically occurs in jewish lists of those who have entered heaven alive .
centuries after his departure the jewish nation awaits the coming of elijah to precede the coming of the messiah .
for many christians this prophecy was fulfilled in the gospels , where he appears during the transfiguration alongside moses ( ) .
commentators have said that moses ' appearance represented the law , while elijah's appearance represented the prophets .
the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints believes that elijah returned on april *num* , *num* in an appearance to joseph smith and oliver cowdery , fulfilling the prophecy in malachi .
the bahá'í faith believes elijah returned as the biblical prophet john the baptist and as the báb who founded the bábí faith in *num* .
the nation of islam believes elijah returned as elijah muhammad , black separatist religious leader ( who claimed to be a " messenger " , not a prophet ) .
this is considered less important than their belief that allah himself showed up in the person of fard muhammad , the founder of the group .
it differs notably from most beliefs about elijah , in that his re-appearance is usually the precursor to a greater one's appearance , rather than an afterthought .
bride of the monster bride of the monster is a *num* american science fiction horror film directed , written , and produced by edward d .
wood jr .
, and starring bela lugosi , along with tor johnson , tony mccoy and loretta king .
the film is considered to have wood's biggest budget ( $70 , *num* ) .
production commenced in *num* but , due to further financial problems , was not completed until *num* .
it was released in may of *num* , initially on a double bill with " macumba " .
a sequel , entitled " night of the ghouls " , was finished in *num* , but due to last-minute financial problems , was not released until *num* .
in a stretch of woods , two hunters are caught in a " raging thunderstorm " .
they decide to seek refuge in willows house , which is supposedly abandoned and haunted .
when they reach willows house , they find it to be occupied and the current owner repeatedly denies them hospitality .
one of the hunters attempts to force his entry into the house , but a giant octopus is released from its tank and sent after the intruders .
one of the fleeing hunters is killed by the octopus , while the other is captured by the giant .
the owner is a scientist , dr .
eric vornoff , and the giant is his mute assistant , lobo .
vornoff explains that he will perform an experiment on the unwilling hunter , who dies on the operating table .
in a police station , officer tom robbins sees lieutenant dick craig .
there are now *num* missing victims , and the police still do not know what happened to them .
the reporter behind the newspaper reports is janet lawton , craig's fiancée .
janet forces her way into the office and argues with robbins , and vows to go to lake marsh to investigate .
at the police station , robbins and craig have a meeting with an intellectual from europe , professor vladimir strowski , who agrees to assist the police in investigating the marsh , but not at night .
as night falls and another storm begins , janet drives alone to lake marsh , but visibility is poor and she drives off the road and into a ravine .
lobo rescues her .
janet awakens to find herself a prisoner of vornoff , who uses hypnosis to put her back to sleep .
the following day , craig and his partner drive to the area around lake marsh , a swamp .
the partners also discuss the strange weather and mention that the newspapers could be right about " the atom bomb explosions distorting the atmosphere " .
the duo eventually discover janet's abandoned car and realize she is the *ord* missing victim .
they leave the swamp while , strowski drives a rented car to the swamp .
janet awakens at willows house .
vornoff assures her that lobo is harmless , but the giant seems fascinated with the female captive and approaches her with questionable intent .
vornoff explains the giant is human and that vornoff found him in the " wilderness of tibet " .
vornoff then hypnotically places janet back to sleep .
he orders lobo to transport the captive to vornoff's private quarters .
meanwhile , strowski silently approaches willows house and enters through the unlocked front door .
while strowski searches the house , vornoff arrives to greet him .
their country of origin is interested in vornoff's groundbreaking experiments with atomic energy and wants to recruit him .
vornoff narrates that two decades prior , vornoff had suggested using experiments with nuclear power which could create superhumans of great strength and size .
in response , he was branded a madman and exiled by his country .
strowski reveals that he has dreams of conquest in the name of their country , while vornoff dreams of his creations conquering in his own name .
by late evening , craig and his partner return to the swamp and discover strowski's abandoned car .
the partners split up to search the area , craig heading towards willows house .
back in the secret laboratory , vornoff uses a wave of his hand to summon janet to his current location .
she arrives dressed as a bride , summoned through telepathy .
he has decided to use her as the next subject of his experiments .
lobo is reluctant to take part in this experiment , and vornoff uses a whip to re-assert his control over his slave and assistant .
meanwhile , craig has entered the house and accidentally discovers the secret passage .
he is himself captured by vornoff and lobo .
as the experiment is about to begin , lobo is visibly distressed .
taking his decision , lobo rebels and attacks vornoff .
after a fight , lobo knocks vornoff out , releases janet , and transports the unconscious vornoff to the operating table .
the scientist becomes the subject of his own human experiment .
this time the experiment works and vornoff is transformed to an atomic-powered superhuman being .
he and lobo physically struggle with each other , and their fight destroys the laboratory and starts a fire .
vornoff grabs janet and escapes from the flames .
robbins and other officers arrive to help craig .
the police pursue vornoff through the woods .
there is another thunderstorm , and a lightning strike further destroys willows house .
with his home and equipment destroyed , a distressed vornoff abandons janet and merely attempts to escape .
craig rolls a rock at him and lands him in the water with the octopus .
they struggle until a nuclear explosion obliterate both combatants , apparently the end result of the chain reaction started at the destroyed laboratory .
robbins comments that vornoff " tampered in god's domain " .
the first incarnation of the film was a *num* script by alex gordon titled " the atomic monster " , but a lack of financing prevented any production .
later ed wood revived the project as " the monster of the marshes " .
actual shooting began in october *num* at the ted allan studios , but further money problems quickly halted the production .
the required funds were supplied by a rancher named donald mccoy , who became the film's producer .
he also provided his son to star as the film's hero .
according to screenwriter dennis rodriguez , casting the younger mccoy as a protagonist was one of two terms donald imposed on wood .
the other term was to include an atomic explosion in the finale .
production resumed in *num* at centaur studios .
the film premiered at hollywood's paramount theater in may *num* , under the title " bride of the atom " .
the film was reportedly completed and released through a deal with samuel z .
arkoff .
arkoff profited from the film more than wood , and his earnings contributed to the funding of american international pictures .
the ending credits identify the copyright holder of the film as " filmakers releasing organization " .
distribution rights were held by banner films in the united states , and by exclusive in the united kingdom .
the film combines elements of science fiction and horror fiction , genres which were frequently combined in films of the 1950s .
like many of these contemporaries , " bride " serves in part as a cold war propaganda film .
once again , an external threat from " old europe " serves as the enemy of the righteous united states .
in cold war thrillers , foreign nations served as a vilified and demonized other for american audiences .
the country of origin for vornoff and strowski is left unnamed .
the only clues is that it is european and has its own dreams of conquest .
by implication , the country which exiled vornoff in the 1930s could be nazi germany or the soviet union .
their role as villains for the american cinema had already been solidified by the 1950s , and wood could be alluding to both of them .
strowski uses the term master race , which is a key concept in nazism .
both the working title " bride of the atom " and the final title " bride of the monster " allude to the earlier film " bride of frankenstein " ( *num* ) .
the film otherwise follows the template of the poverty row horror films of the 1940s .
the atomic age influences the film in its ominous implications concerning nuclear weapons and the threat they posed towards human civilization .
rob craig makes an argument for including the film in a subgenre of cold war-themed thrillers along with " kiss me deadly " ( *num* ) , " the world , the flesh and the devil " ( *num* ) , " on the beach " ( *num* ) , " the manchurian candidate " ( *num* ) , " dr .
strangelove " ( *num* ) , " seven days in may " ( *num* ) and " fail-safe " ( *num* ) .
this was bela lugosi's last speaking role in a feature film .
lugosi subsequently played a silent part in " the black sleep " ( *num* ) .
" plan *num* from outer space " ( *num* ) uses silent archive footage of lugosi , but he died prior to the creation of its script .
the footage was from an unfinished ed wood film that was to be called " the vampire's tomb " " lock up your daughters " ( *num* ) recycled footage from lugosi's earlier films , possibly mixed with some new material .
.
according to rob craig , in " bride " lugosi for the last time plays " a charismatic villain whose megalomania leads to downfall and destruction " .
craig considers this to be one of lugosi's finest roles , citing the surprisingly energetic performance of the aging actor .
the scenes involving hypnosis contain close-ups of lugosi's eyes .
wood was probably trying to recreate similar scenes from an older film of lugosi , " white zombie " ( *num* ) .
lugosi did not actually play vornoff in the scenes demanding physicality .
the film made use of body doubles for lugosi : eddie parker and red reagan .
parker was also the body-double of lugosi in " frankenstein meets the wolf man " ( *num* ) .
lugosi's fee for the film is estimated to have been *num* dollars .
the story could almost be a sequel to an earlier bela lugosi movie , " the corpse vanishes " ( each bride at her wedding was given an orchid , which she sniffed before passing out .
in " the corpse vanishes " , bela played a doctor who captured the brides and took some kind of liquid from each bride's body and injected it into his wife to make her temporarily young again .
characters included his wife , an old woman , the old woman's grown son , and a dwarf .
) in " bride of the monster " , bela again plays a doctor doing experiments , but his only housemate / assistant is lobo , and when his experiment fails to turn someone into an " atomic-powered superman " , he throws the dead subject to an octopus or an alligator , similar to what bela did in " murders in the rue morgue " .
the hunters of the opening scenes are unnamed in the actual scenes , but identified later in the film as jake long and blake " mac " mccreigh .
according to the credits , jake was played by john warren and mac by bud osborne .
the police station scenes feature cameos by a drunk and a newspaper seller .
the former is played by ben frommer ( known for playing count bloodcount in " transylvania 6-5000 " ) , the latter is played by william benedict ( known as one of the bowery boys ) .
janet lawton briefly speaks with a co-worker called margie .
margie is played by dolores fuller .
dick craig's partner , martin , is played by don nagel .
both fuller and nagel had worked with wood in " jail bait " ( *num* ) .
the film uses both stock footage of both a real octopus and a fake , rubber octopus in scenes where " the monster " interacts with the actors .
it is widely believed this was a prop from the john wayne film " wake of the red witch " ( *num* ) .
contradictory accounts claim that wood either stole or legally rented the prop from republic pictures , which produced the earlier film .
the struggle between vornoff and the octopus was filmed at griffith park .
craig comments that there is a stark contrast between the characters of dick craig and janet lawton .
dick speaks in a deadpan unemotional way and seems to be a rather lethargic character .
janet is a " brassy girl reporter " , a dynamic character with a sense of autonomy .
the role was reportedly intended for dolores fuller .
according to fuller's recollections , loretta king bribed wood into casting her as janet , with promises of securing further funding for the film .
fuller was thus reduced to a cameo role .
king vehemently denies bribing wood in any way , so the story lacks confirmation .
in a subplot of the film , there are storms every night for three months and strange weather patterns .
the characters attribute the phenomenon to the effects the nuclear explosions have on the atmosphere .
this probably reflects actual anxiety of the 1950s about potential climate change .
until the partial nuclear test ban treaty ( *num* ) , atmospheric nuclear weapons testing was used widely and recklessly .
rob craig suggests that the months of constant storms could be inspired by the genesis flood narrative .
in the context of the film , the strange weather is implied to be a side-effect of the experiments of vornoff which apparently release radioactivity into the atmosphere .
the dialogue of the film includes memorable lines such as " "home ? i have no home ! " " and " "one is always considered mad , when one discovers something which others cannot grasp" " , as well as the closing line " "he tampered in god's domain" " .
the phrases could well apply to the fates of avant-garde artists and thinkers .
the title " "bride of the atom" " , which vornoff uses for janet in the bridal dress , is inexplicable unless the scientist is actually attempting to use janet to replace his long-lost wife .
one of his reassuring lines to janet concerning the experiment , " "it hurts , just for a moment , but then you will emerge a woman .
.
.
" " , sounds as if preparing her for the loss of her virginity .
the scene of a young woman , in a bridal gown , restrained by leather shackles seems to be sadomasochistic in nature .
throughout the film , the mute lobo is implied to have an unspecified intellectual disability and to be of sub-human intelligence .
yet he successfully operates complex machinery as if trained to do so .
craig views this scene as implying that supposedly " dumb " servants , can have a capacity of learning the secrets of their masters .
the final scenes , with the mushroom cloud of the nuclear explosion , use stock footage from the blast of a thermonuclear weapon ( " hydrogen bomb " ) .
the apparent fetish of lobo with angora wool is a reflection of wood's own fetish for the material .
this also serves as the film's connection to " glen or glenda " ( *num* ) , where the fetish plays a more prominent role .
the character of lobo also appeared again in wood's " night of the ghouls " .
this film served as a sequel of sorts to " bride " .
vornoff is absent from the later film , but there are references to the activities of " the mad doctor " .
this film is part of what wood aficionados refer to as " the kelton trilogy " , a trio of films featuring paul marco as officer kelton , a whining , reluctant policeman .
the other two films are " plan *num* from outer space " and " night of the ghouls " .
kelton is the only character to appear in all three films .
in *num* , the film was featured in the syndicated series , the " canned film festival " and was later featured on the comedy series , " mystery science theater *num* " .
the late 1990s dream trance track " alright " , by dj taucher , sampled a monologue from bela lugosi during the interlude of the song .
in *num* , the devil's rejects footage of the movie was played in the movie .
in *num* , a colorized version was released by legend films .
this version is also available from amazon video on demand .
in *num* , a retrospective on the movie entitled " citizen wood : making ‘the bride’ , unmaking the legend " was included in the " mystery science theater *num* " volume *num* dvd set as a bonus feature for said episode featuring the movie .
horror host mr .
lobo is among the interviewees of the *num* minute documentary .
in *num* , the book " the golden turkey awards " claims that lugosi's character declares his manservant lobo ( tor johnson ) " as harmless as kitchen " .
this allegedly misspoken line is cited as evidence of either lugosi's failing health / mental faculties , or as further evidence of wood's incompetence as a director .
however , a viewing of the film itself reveals that lugosi said this line correctly , the exact words being , " "don't be afraid of lobo ; he's as gentle as a kitten .
" " the easier explanation would be that authors michael medved and harry medved saw the film in a theater setting with inferior sound quality .
a single viewing in such conditions could result in mishearing some lines of dialogue .
unfortunately the inaccurate claim managed to achieve urban legend status , and it keeps circulating .
in *num* , the biopic " ed wood " , directed by tim burton , alleged that wood and the filmmakers stole the mechanical octopus ( previously used in the film " wake of the red witch " ) from the republic studios backlot , while failing to steal the motor which enabled the prop to move realistically , although , by the director's admission , the film preferred narrative interest over historical accuracy .
these events are also alleged in the *num* documentary , " the *num* worst movies ever made .
" however , other stories circulated insist wood legitimately rented the octopus , along with some cars .
to remedy the lack of movement from the octopus prop , whenever someone was killed by the monster in the film , they simply flailed around in the shallow water while holding the tentacles to imitate movement .
the filming of these scenes , as well as the production of the film in general , were played to comic effect in " ed wood " .
rudolph grey's book " nightmare of ecstasy : the life and art of edward d .
wood jr .
" contains anecdotes regarding the making of this film .
grey notes that participants in the original events sometimes contradict one another , but he relates each person's information for posterity .
he also includes ed wood's claim that one of his films made a profit and surmises that it was most likely " bride of the monster " , but that wood had oversold the film and could not reimburse the backers .
politics of french guiana french guiana is not a separate territory but is both an overseas région and overseas department of france , with the same government institutions as areas on the french mainland .
the administrative center is cayenne .
the president of france appoints a prefect ( resident at the prefecture building in cayenne ) as his representative to head the local government of french guiana .
there are two local executive bodies : the 19‑member general council and the 34‑member regional council , both elected .
they will soon be reunited into a single council , since they have authority on exactly the same territory .
in *num* the prefect is éric spitz .
the president of the general council is alain tien-liong and the president of the regional council is rodolphe alexandre .
politics in french guiana are dominated by the guianese socialist party , which has a close association with the socialist party in mainland france .
a chronic issue affecting french guiana is the influx of illegal immigrants and clandestine gold prospectors from brazil and suriname .
the border between the department and suriname is formed by the maroni river , which flows through rain forest and is difficult for the gendarmerie and the french foreign legion to patrol .
there have been several phases launched by the french government to combat illegal gold mining in french guiana , beginning with operation anaconda beginning in *num* , followed by operation harpie in *num* , *num* and operation harpie reinforce in *num* .
colonel françois müller , the commander of french guiana's gendarme , believes these operations have been successful .
however , after each operation ends , brazilian miners , garimpeiros , return .
soon after operation harpie reinforce began , an altercation took place between french authorities and brazilian miners .
on march *num* , *num* , a team of french soldiers and border police were attacked while returning from a successful operation , during which " the soldiers had arrested *num* miners , confiscated three boats , and seized *num* grams of gold .
.
.
currently worth about $22 , *num* " .
garimpeiros returned to retrieve the lost loot and colleagues .
" the soldiers fired warning shots and rubber " flash balls " but the miners managed to retake one of their boats and about *num* grammes of gold .
" the violent reaction by the garimpeiros can be explained by the exceptional take of *num* grammes of gold , about *num* percent of the quantity seized in *num* during the battle against illegal mining " , said phillipe duporge , the director of french guiana's border police , at a press conference the next day .
" the general council of french guiana is the deliberative executive assembly and is composed of *num* members who are elected by popular vote to serve six-year terms .
it is led by the president of the general council of french guiana .
the regional council of french guiana is the elected assembly or regional council and is composed of *num* members who are elected by popular vote to serve six-year terms .
guiana elects two senators to the french senate .
both of the current senators , georges patient and jean-étienne antoinette , are members of the guianese socialist party guiana also elects two deputies to the french national assembly .
the last elections were held in june *num* .
the walwari has one deputy , christiane taubira , and the psg has one deputy , chantal berthelot , who defeated long-time ump incumbent léon bertrand .
aspirated consonant in phonetics , aspiration is the strong burst of breath that accompanies either the release or , in the case of preaspiration , the closure of some obstruents .
in english , aspirated consonants are allophones in complementary distribution with their unaspirated counterparts , but in some other languages , notably most indian and east asian languages , the difference is contrastive , while in arabic and persian , all stops are aspirated .
to feel or see the difference between aspirated and unaspirated sounds , one can put a hand or a lit candle in front of one's mouth , and say " spin " and then " pin " .
one should either feel a puff of air or see a flicker of the candle flame with " pin " that one does not get with " spin " .
in the international phonetic alphabet ( ipa ) , aspirated consonants are written using the symbols for voiceless consonants followed by the aspiration modifier letter , a superscript form of the symbol for the voiceless glottal fricative .
for instance , represents the voiceless bilabial stop , and represents the aspirated bilabial stop .
voiced consonants are seldom actually aspirated .
symbols for voiced consonants followed by , such as , typically represent consonants with murmured voiced release ( see below ) .
in the grammatical tradition of sanskrit , aspirated consonants are called voiceless aspirated , and breathy-voiced consonants are called voiced aspirated .
there are no dedicated ipa symbols for degrees of aspiration and typically only two degrees are marked : unaspirated and aspirated .
an old symbol for light aspiration was , but this is now obsolete .
the aspiration modifier letter may be doubled to indicate especially strong or long aspiration .
hence , the two degrees of aspiration in korean stops are sometimes transcribed or and , but they are usually transcribed and , with the details of voice onset time given numerically .
preaspirated consonants are marked by placing the aspiration modifier letter before the consonant symbol : represents the preaspirated bilabial stop .
unaspirated or tenuis consonants are occasionally marked with the modifier letter for unaspiration , a superscript equals sign : .
usually , however , unaspirated consonants are left unmarked : .
voiceless consonants are produced with the vocal folds open ( spread ) and not vibrating , and voiced consonants are produced when the vocal folds are fractionally closed and vibrating ( modal voice ) .
voiceless aspiration occurs when the vocal folds remain open after a consonant is released .
an easy way to measure this is by noting the consonant's voice onset time , as the voicing of a following vowel cannot begin until the vocal folds close .
phonetically in some languages , such as navajo , aspiration of stops tends to be realised as voiceless velar airflow ; aspiration of affricates is realised as an extended length of the frication .
aspirated consonants are not always followed by vowels or other voiced sounds .
for example , in eastern armenian , aspiration is contrastive even word-finally , and aspirated consonants occur in consonant clusters .
in wahgi , consonants are aspirated only in final position .
the degree of aspiration varies : the voice onset time of aspirated stops is longer or shorter depending on the language or the place of articulation .
armenian and cantonese have aspiration that lasts about as long as english aspirated stops , in addition to unaspirated stops .
korean has lightly aspirated stops that fall between the armenian and cantonese unaspirated and aspirated stops as well as strongly aspirated stops whose aspiration lasts longer than that of armenian or cantonese .
( see voice onset time .
) aspiration varies with place of articulation .
the spanish voiceless stops have voice onset times ( vots ) of about *num* , *num* , and *num* milliseconds , whereas english aspirated have vots of about *num* , *num* , and *num* ms .
voice onset time in korean has been measured at *num* , *num* , and *num* ms for and *num* , *num* , and *num* for .
when aspirated consonants are doubled or geminated , the stop is held longer and then has an aspirated release .
an aspirated affricate consists of a stop , fricative , and aspirated release .
a doubled aspirated affricate has a longer hold in the stop portion and then has a release consisting of the fricative and aspiration .
icelandic and faroese have consonants with preaspiration , and some scholars interpret them as consonant clusters as well .
in icelandic , preaspirated stops contrast with double stops and single stops : preaspirated stops also occur in most sami languages .
for example , in northern sami , the unvoiced stop and affricate phonemes , , , , are pronounced preaspirated ( , , , ) in medial or final position .
although most aspirated obstruents in the world's languages are stops and affricates , aspirated fricatives such as , or have been documented in korean , though these are allophones of other phonemes .
similarly , aspirated fricatives and even aspirated nasals , approximants , and trills occur in a few tibeto-burman languages , in some oto-manguean languages , in the hmongic language hmu , and in the siouan language ofo .
some languages , such as choni tibetan , have as many as four contrastive aspirated fricatives , and .
true aspirated voiced consonants , as opposed to murmured ( breathy-voice ) consonants such as the that are common in the languages of india , are extremely rare .
they have been documented in kelabit taa , and the kx'a languages .
reported aspirated voiced stops , affricates and clicks are prevoiced .
aspiration has varying significance in different languages .
it is either allophonic or phonemic , and may be analyzed as an underlying consonant cluster .
in some languages , such as english , aspiration is allophonic .
stops are distinguished primarily by voicing , and voiceless stops are sometimes aspirated , while voiced stops are usually unaspirated .
english voiceless stops are aspirated for most native speakers when they are word-initial or begin a stressed syllable , as in " pill " , " till " , " kill " .
they are unaspirated for almost all speakers when immediately following word-initial s , as in " spill " , " still " , " skill " .
after an " s " elsewhere in a word they are normally unaspirated as well , except sometimes in compound words .
when the consonants in a cluster like " st " are analyzed as belonging to different morphemes ( heteromorphemic ) the stop is aspirated , but when they are analyzed as belonging to one morpheme the stop is unaspirated .
for instance , " distend " has unaspirated since it is not analyzed as two morphemes , but " distaste " has an aspirated middle because it is analyzed as " dis- " + " taste " and the word " taste " has an aspirated initial " t " .
word-final voiceless stops are sometimes aspirated .
voiceless stops in pashto are slightly aspirated prevocalically in a stressed syllable .
in many languages , such as armenian , korean , lakota , thai , indo-aryan languages , dravidian languages , icelandic , ancient greek , and the varieties of chinese , tenuis and aspirated consonants are phonemic .
unaspirated consonants like and aspirated consonants like are separate phonemes , and words are distinguished by whether they have one or the other .
alemannic german dialects have unaspirated as well as aspirated ; the latter series are usually viewed as consonant clusters .
in danish and most southern varieties of german , the lenis consonants transcribed for historical reasons as are distinguished from their fortis counterparts , mainly in their lack of aspiration .
french , standard dutch , tamil , italian , russian , spanish , modern greek , portuguese and latvian are languages that do not have phonemic aspirated consonants .
standard chinese ( mandarin ) has stops and affricates distinguished by aspiration : for instance , , .
in pinyin , tenuis stops are written with letters that represent voiced consonants in english , and aspirated stops with letters that represent voiceless consonants .
thus " d " represents , and " t " represents .
wu chinese and southern min has a three-way distinction in stops and affricates : .
in addition to aspirated and unaspirated consonants , there is a series of " muddy consonants " , like .
these are pronounced with slack or breathy voice : that is , they are weakly voiced .
muddy consonants as initial cause a syllable to be pronounced with low pitch or " light " ( 陽 " yáng " ) tone .
many indo-aryan languages have aspirated stops .
sanskrit , hindi , bengali , marathi , and gujarati have a four-way distinction in stops : voiceless , aspirated , voiced , and breathy-voiced or voiced aspirated , such as .
punjabi has lost breathy-voiced consonants , which resulted in a tone system , and therefore has a distinction between voiceless , aspirated , and voiced : .
some of the dravidian languages , such as telugu , malayalam , and kannada , have a distinction between voiced and voiceless , aspirated and unaspirated only in loanwords from indo-aryan languages .
in native dravidian words , there is no distinction between these categories and stops are underspecified for voicing and aspiration .
most dialects of armenian have aspirated stops , and some have breathy-voiced stops .
classical and eastern armenian have a three-way distinction between voiceless , aspirated , and voiced , such as .
western armenian has a two-way distinction between aspirated and voiced : .
western armenian aspirated corresponds to eastern armenian aspirated and voiced , and western voiced corresponds to eastern voiceless .
some forms of greek before the koine greek period are reconstructed as having aspirated stops .
the classical attic dialect of ancient greek had a three-way distinction in stops like eastern armenian : .
these series were called , , ( " psilá , daséa , mésa " ) " smooth , rough , intermediate " , respectively , by koine greek grammarians .
there were aspirated stops at three places of articulation : labial , coronal , and velar .
earlier greek , represented by mycenaean greek , likely had a labialized velar aspirated stop , which later became labial , coronal , or velar depending on dialect and phonetic environment .
the other ancient greek dialects , ionic , doric , aeolic , and arcadocypriot , likely had the same three-way distinction at one point , but doric seems to have had a fricative in place of in the classical period , and the ionic and aeolic dialects sometimes lost aspiration ( psilosis ) .
later , during the koine greek period , the aspirated and voiced stops of attic greek lenited to voiceless and voiced fricatives , yielding in medieval and modern greek .
the term " aspiration " sometimes refers to the sound change of debuccalization , in which a consonant is lenited ( weakened ) to become a glottal stop or fricative .
so-called voiced aspirated consonants are nearly always pronounced instead with breathy voice , a type of phonation or vibration of the vocal folds .
the modifier letter after a voiced consonant actually represents a breathy-voiced or murmured dental stop , as with the " voiced aspirated " bilabial stop in the indo-aryan languages .
this consonant is therefore more accurately transcribed as , with the diacritic for breathy voice , or with the modifier letter , a superscript form of the symbol for the voiced glottal fricative .
some linguists restrict the double-dot subscript to murmured sonorants , such as vowels and nasals , which are murmured throughout their duration , and use the superscript hook-aitch for the breathy-voiced release of obstruents .
book of ezekiel the book of ezekiel is the third of the latter prophets in the tanakh and one of the major prophetic books in the old testament , following isaiah and jeremiah .
according to the book itself , it records six visions of the prophet ezekiel , exiled in babylon , during the *num* years 593–571 bc , although it is the product of a long and complex history and does not necessarily preserve the very words of the prophet .
the visions , and the book , are structured around three themes : ( *num* ) judgment on israel ( chapters 1–24 ) ; ( *num* ) judgment on the nations ( chapters 25–32 ) ; and ( *num* ) future blessings for israel ( chapters 33–48 ) .
its themes include the concepts of the presence of god , purity , israel as a divine community , and individual responsibility to god .
its later influence has included the development of mystical and apocalyptic traditions in second temple and rabbinic judaism and christianity .
ezekiel has the broad three-fold structure found in a number of the prophetic books : oracles of woe against the prophet's own people , followed by oracles against israel's neighbours , ending in prophecies of hope and salvation : the book opens with a vision of yhwh ( ) .
the book moves on to anticipate the destruction of jerusalem and the temple , explains this as god's punishment , and closes with the promise of a new beginning and a new temple .
some of the highlights include : the book of ezekiel describes itself as the words of the ezekiel ben-buzi , a priest living in exile in the city of babylon between *num* and *num* bc .
most scholars today accept the basic authenticity of the book , but see in it significant additions by a " school " of later followers of the original prophet .
while the book exhibits considerable unity and probably reflects much of the historic ezekiel , it is the product of a long and complex history and does not necessarily preserve the very words of the prophet .
according to the book that bears his name , ezekiel ben-buzi was born into a priestly family of jerusalem c .
*num* bc , during the reign of the reforming king josiah .
prior to this time , judah had been a vassal of the assyrian empire , but the rapid decline of assyria after c .
*num* led josiah to assert his independence and institute a religious reform stressing loyalty to yahweh , the national god of israel .
josiah was killed in *num* and judah became a vassal of the new regional power , the neo-babylonian empire .
in *num* , following a rebellion against babylon , ezekiel was among the large group of judeans taken into captivity by the babylonians .
he appears to have spent the rest of his life in mesopotamia .
a further deportation of jews from jerusalem to babylon occurred in *num* when a second unsuccessful rebellion resulted in the destruction of the city and its temple and the exile of the remaining elements of the royal court , including the last scribes and priests .
the various dates given in the book suggest that ezekiel was *num* when he went into exile , *num* when he received his prophetic call , and *num* at the time of the last vision c .
*num* .
the jewish scriptures were translated into greek in the two centuries immediately before the birth of christ .
the greek version of these books is called the septuagint .
the jewish bible in hebrew is called the masoretic text ( meaning " passing down " after a hebrew word " masorah " ; for jewish scholars and rabbis curated and commented on the text ) .
the greek ( septuagint ) version of ezekiel differs considerably from the hebrew ( masoretic ) version – it is shorter and possibly represents an early interpretation of the book we have today ( according to the masoretic tradition ) – while other ancient manuscript fragments differ from both .
the first half of the *ord* century saw several attempts to deny the authorship and authenticity of the book , with scholars such as c .
c .
torrey ( 1863–1956 ) and morton smith placing it variously in the *ord* century bc and in the *ord* / *ord* .
the pendulum swung back in the post-war period , with an increasing acceptance of the book's essential unity and historical placement in the exile .
the most influential modern scholarly work on ezekiel , walther zimmerli's two-volume commentary , appeared in german in *num* and in english in *num* and *num* .
zimmerli traces the process by which ezekiel's oracles were delivered orally and transformed into a written text by the prophet and his followers through a process of ongoing re-writing and re-interpretation .
he isolates the oracles and speeches behind the present text , and traces ezekiel's interaction with a mass of mythological , legendary and literary material as he developed his insights into yahweh's purposes during the period of destruction and exile .
as a priest , ezekiel is fundamentally concerned with the " kavod yhwh " , a technical phrase meaning the presence ( shekhinah ) of yhwh ( i .
e .
, one of the names of god ) among the people , in the tabernacle , and in the temple , and normally translated as " glory of god " .
in ezekiel the phrase describes god mounted on his throne-chariot as he departs from the temple in chapters 1–11 and returns to what marvin sweeney describes as a portrayal of " the establishment of the new temple in zion as yhwh returns to the temple , which then serves as the center for a new creation with the tribes of israel arrayed around it " in chapters 40–48 .
the vision in chapters *num* : 4–28 reflects common mythological / biblical themes and the imagery of the temple : god appears in a cloud from the north – the north being the usual home of god / the gods in ancient mythology and biblical literature – with four living creatures corresponding to the two cherubim above the mercy seat of the ark of the covenant and the two in the holy of holies , the innermost chamber of the temple ; the burning coals of fire between the creatures perhaps represents the fire on the sacrificial altar , and the famous " wheel within a wheel " may represent the rings by which the levites carried the ark , or the wheels of the cart .
ezekiel depicts the destruction of jerusalem as a purificatory sacrifice upon the altar , made necessary by the " abominations " in the temple ( the presence of idols and the worship of the god tammuz ) described in chapter *num* .
the process of purification begins , god prepares to leave , and a priest lights the sacrificial fire to the city .
nevertheless , the prophet announces that a small remnant will remain true to yahweh in exile , and will return to the purified city .
the image of the valley of dry bones returning to life in chapter *num* signifies the restoration of the purified israel .
previous prophets had used " israel " to mean the northern kingdom and its tribes ; when ezekiel speaks of israel he is addressing the deported remnant of judah ; at the same time , however , he can use this term to mean the glorious future destiny of a truly comprehensive " israel " .
in sum , the book describes god's promise that the people of israel will maintain their covenant with god when they are purified and receive a " new heart " ( another of the book's images ) which will enable them to observe god's commandments and live in the land in a proper relationship with yahweh .
the theology of ezekiel is notable for its contribution to the emerging notion of individual responsibility to god – each man would be held responsible only for his own sins .
this is in marked contrast to the deuteronomistic writers , who held that the sins of the nation would be held against all , without regard for an individual's personal guilt .
nonetheless , ezekiel shared many ideas in common with the deuteronomists , notably the notion that god works according to the principle of retributive justice and an ambivalence towards kingship ( although the deuteronomists reserved their scorn for individual kings rather than for the office itself ) .
as a priest , ezekiel praises the zadokites over the levites ( lower level temple functionaries ) , whom he largely blames for the destruction and exile .
he is clearly connected with the holiness code and its vision of a future dependent on keeping the laws of god and maintaining ritual purity .
notably , ezekiel blames the babylonian exile not on the people's failure to keep the law , but on their worship of gods other than yahweh and their injustice : these , says ezekiel in chapters 8–11 , are the reasons god's shekhinah left his city and his people .
ezekiel's imagery provided much of the basis for the second temple mystical tradition in which the visionary ascended through the seven heavens in order to experience the presence of god and understand his actions and intentions .
the book's literary influence can be seen in the later apocalyptic writings of daniel and zechariah .
he is specifically mentioned by ben sirah ( a writer of the hellenistic period who listed the " great sages " of israel ) and *num* maccabees ( *ord* century ad ) .
in the *ord* century ad the historian josephus said that the prophet wrote two books : he may have had in mind the apocryphon of ezekiel , a 1st-century bc text that expands on the doctrine of resurrection .
ezekiel appears only briefly in the dead sea scrolls , but his influence there was profound , most notably in the temple scroll with its temple plans , and the defence of the zadokite priesthood in the damascus document .
there was apparently some question concerning the inclusion of ezekiel in the canon of scripture , since it is frequently at odds with the torah ( the five " books of moses " which are foundational to judaism ) .
ezekiel is referenced more in the book of revelation than in any other new testament writing .
to take just two well-known passages , the famous gog and magog prophecy in revelation *num* : *num* refers back to ezekiel 38–39 , and in revelation 21–22 , as in the closing visions of ezekiel , the prophet is transported to a high mountain where a heavenly messenger measures the symmetrical new jerusalem , complete with high walls and twelve gates , the dwelling-place of god where his people will enjoy a state of perfect well-being .
apart from revelation , however , where ezekiel is a major source , there is very little allusion to the prophet in the new testament ; the reasons for this are unclear , but it can be assumed that not every christian or hellenistic jewish community in the *ord* century would have had a complete set of ( hebrew ) scripture scrolls , and in any case ezekiel was under suspicion of encouraging dangerous mystical speculation , as well as being sometimes obscure , incoherent , and pornographic .
chupacabra the chupacabra or chupacabras ( , literally " goat-sucker " ; from " chupar " , " to suck " , and " cabra " , " goat " ) is a legendary creature in the folklore of parts of the americas , with its first purported sightings reported in puerto rico .
the name comes from the animal's reported habit of attacking and drinking the blood of livestock , including goats .
physical descriptions of the creature vary .
it is purportedly a heavy creature , the size of a small bear , with a row of spines reaching from the neck to the base of the tail .
eyewitness sightings have been claimed in puerto rico , and have since been reported as far north as maine , and as far south as chile , and even being spotted outside the americas in countries like russia and the philippines , but many of the reports have been disregarded as uncorroborated or lacking evidence .
sightings in northern mexico and the southern united states have been verified as canids afflicted by mange .
according to biologists and wildlife management officials , the chupacabra is an urban legend .
"chupacabras " can be literally translated as " goat-sucker " , from " chupar " ( " to suck " ) and " cabra " ( " goat " ) .
it is known as both " chupacabras " and " chupacabra " throughout the americas , with the former being the original word , and the latter a regularization of it .
the name is attributed to puerto rican comedian silverio pérez , who coined the label in *num* while commenting on the attacks as a san juan radio deejay .
the first reported attack eventually attributed to the creatures occurred in march *num* in puerto rico .
eight sheep were discovered dead , each with three puncture wounds in the chest area and completely drained of blood .
a few months later , in august , an eyewitness , madelyne tolentino , reported seeing the creature in the puerto rican town of canóvanas , when as many as *num* farm animals and pets were reportedly killed .
in *num* , similar killings in the small town of moca were attributed to " el vampiro de moca " ( " the vampire of moca " ) .
initially , it was suspected that the killings were committed by a satanic cult ; later more killings were reported around the island , and many farms reported loss of animal life .
each of the animals was reported to have had its body bled dry through a series of small circular incisions .
puerto rican comedian and entrepreneur silverio pérez is credited with coining the term " chupacabras " soon after the first incidents were reported in the press .
shortly after the first reported incidents in puerto rico , other animal deaths were reported in other countries , such as the dominican republic , argentina , bolivia , chile , colombia , honduras , el salvador , nicaragua , panama , peru , brazil , united states , and mexico .
a five-year investigation by benjamin radford , documented in his *num* book " tracking the chupacabra " , concluded that the description given by the original eyewitness in puerto rico , madelyne tolentino , was based on the creature sil in the *num* science-fiction horror film " species " .
the alien creature sil is nearly identical to tolentino’s chupacabra eyewitness account and she had seen the movie before her report : " it was a creature that looked like the chupacabra , with spines on its back and all .
.
.
the resemblance to the chupacabra was really impressive , " tolentino reported .
radford revealed that tolentino " believed that the creatures and events she saw in " species " were happening in reality in puerto rico at the time , " and therefore concludes that " the most important chupacabra description cannot be trusted .
" this , radford believes , seriously undermines the credibility of the chupacabra as a real animal .
in addition , the reports of blood-sucking by the chupacabra were never confirmed by a necropsy , the only way to conclude that the animal was drained of blood .
an analysis by a veterinarian of *num* reported victims of the chupacabra found that they had not been bled dry .
radford divided the chupacabra reports into two categories : the reports from puerto rico and latin america where animals were attacked and it is supposed their blood was extracted , and the reports in the united states of mammals , mostly dogs and coyotes with mange , that people call " chupacabra " due to their unusual appearance .
in late october *num* , university of michigan biologist barry o'connor concluded that all the chupacabra reports in the united states were simply coyotes infected with the parasite " sarcoptes scabiei " , whose symptoms would explain most of the features of the chupacabra : they would be left with little fur , thickened skin , and rank odor .
o'connor theorized that the attacks on goats occurred " because these animals are greatly weakened , they're going to have a hard time hunting .
so they may be forced into attacking livestock because it's easier than running down a rabbit or a deer .
" although several witnesses came to the conclusion that the attacks could not be the work of dogs or coyotes because they had not eaten the victim , this conclusion is incorrect .
both dogs and coyotes can kill and not consume the prey , either because they are inexperienced , or due to injury or difficulty in killing the prey .
the prey can survive the attack and die afterwards from internal bleeding or circulatory shock .
the presence of two holes in the neck , corresponding with the canine teeth , are to be expected since this is the only way that most land carnivores have to catch their prey .
there are reports of stray mexican hairless dogs being mistaken for chupacabras .
the most common description of the chupacabra is that of a reptile-like creature , said to have leathery or scaly greenish-gray skin and sharp spines or quills running down its back .
it is said to be approximately high , and stands and hops in a fashion similar to that of a kangaroo .
another common description of the chupacabra is of a strange breed of wild dog .
this form is mostly hairless and has a pronounced spinal ridge , unusually pronounced eye sockets , fangs , and claws .
unlike conventional predators , the chupacabra is said to drain all of the animal's blood ( and sometimes organs ) usually through three holes in the shape of a downwards-pointing triangle or through one or two holes .
a popular legend in new orleans concerns a popular lovers ' lane called grunch road , which was said to be inhabited by " grunches " , creatures similar in appearance to the " chupacabra " .
the peuchens of chile also share similarities in their supposed habits , but instead of being dog-like they are described as winged snakes .
this legend may have originated from the vampire bat , an animal endemic to the region .
in the philippines , another legendary creature called the sigbin shares many of chupacabra's descriptions .
the popularity of the chupacabra has resulted in its being featured in many types of media .
foreign relations of grenada the united states , venezuela , cuba , and the people's republic of china have embassies in grenada .
grenada has been recognized by most members of the united nations and maintains diplomatic missions in the united kingdom , the united states , venezuela , and canada .
grenada is a member of the caribbean development bank , caricom , the organization of eastern caribbean states ( oecs ) , and the commonwealth of nations .
it joined the united nations in *num* , and the world bank , the international monetary fund , and the organization of american states in *num* .
grenada also is a member of the eastern caribbean's regional security system ( rss ) .
grenada has been an independent commonwealth realm since *num* .
even under the people's revolutionary government , grenada was never declared a republic , but remained a commonwealth realm , albeit , under the dictatorship of the new jewel movement's leader , maurice bishop .

false claims act the false claims act , also called the " lincoln law " is an american federal law that imposes liability on persons and companies ( typically federal contractors ) who defraud governmental programs .
it is the federal government's primary litigation tool in combating fraud against the government .
the law includes a " qui tam " provision that allows people who are not affiliated with the government , called " relators " under the law , to file actions on behalf of the government ( informally called " whistleblowing " especially when the relator is employed by the organization accused in the suit ) .
persons filing under the act stand to receive a portion ( usually about 15–25 percent ) of any recovered damages .
as of *num* , over *num* percent of all federal government fca actions were initiated by whistleblowers .
claims under the law have typically involved health care , military , or other government spending programs , and dominate the list of largest pharmaceutical settlements .
the government recovered $38 .
*num* billion under the false claims act between *num* and *num* and of this amount , $27 .
*num* billion or *num* % was from qui tam cases brought by relators .
"qui tam " laws have history dating back to the middle ages in england .
in *num* , king edward ii offered one third of the penalty to the relator when the relator successfully sued government officials who moonlighted as wine merchants .
the maintenance and embracery act *num* of henry viii provided that common informers could sue for certain forms of interference with the course of justice in legal proceedings that were concerned with the title to land .
this act is still in force today in the republic of ireland , although in *num* it was extinguished in england .
the idea of a common informer bringing suit for damages to the commonwealth was later brought to massachusetts , where " penalties for fraud in the sale of bread [ are ] to be distributed one third to inspector who discovered the fraud and the remainder for the benefit of the town where the offense occurred .
" other statutes can be found on the colonial law books of connecticut , new york , virginia and south carolina .
the american civil war ( 1861–1865 ) was marked by fraud on all levels , both in the union north and the confederate south .
during the war , unscrupulous contractors sold the union army decrepit horses and mules in ill health , faulty rifles and ammunition , and rancid rations and provisions , among other unscrupulous actions .
in response , congress passed the false claims act on march *num* , *num* , .
because it was passed under the administration of president abraham lincoln , the false claims act is often referred to as the " lincoln law " .
importantly , a reward was offered in what is called the " qui tam " provision , which permits citizens to sue on behalf of the government and be paid a percentage of the recovery .
" qui tam " is an abbreviated form of the latin legal phrase " qui tam pro domino rege quam pro se ipso in hac parte sequitur " ( " he who brings a case on behalf of our lord the king , as well as for himself " ) in a " qui tam " action , the citizen filing suit is called a " relator " .
as an exception to the general legal rule of standing , courts have held that " qui tam " relators are " partially assigned " a portion of the government's legal injury , thereby allowing relators to proceed with their suits .
u .
s .
senator jacob m .
howard , who sponsored the legislation , justified giving rewards to whistle blowers , many of whom had engaged in unethical activities themselves .
he said , " i have based the [ " qui tam " provision ] upon the old-fashioned idea of holding out a temptation , and ‘setting a rogue to catch a rogue , ’ which is the safest and most expeditious way i have ever discovered of bringing rogues to justice .
" in the massive military spending leading up to and during world war ii , the us attorney general relied on criminal provisions of the law to deal with fraud , rather than using the fca .
as a result , attorneys would wait for the department of justice to file criminal cases and then immediately file civil suits under the fca , a practice decried as " parasitic " at the time .
congress moved to abolish the fca but at the last minute decided instead to reduce the relator's share of the recovered proceeds .
the law was again amended in *num* , again due to issues with military spending .
under president ronald reagan's military buildup , reports of massive fraud among military contractors had become major news , and congress acted to strengthen the fca .
the law has always primarily been used against defense contractors but by the late 1990s , health care fraud began to receive more focus , accounting for approximately *num* % of recoveries by *num* " franklin v .
parke-davis " , filed in *num* , was the first case to apply the fca to fraud committed against the government , due to bills submitted for payment by medicaid / medicare for treatments that those programs do not pay for as they are not fda-approved or otherwise listed on a government formulary .
fca cases in the field of health care are often related to off-label marketing of drugs by drug companies , which is illegal under a different law , the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act ; the intersection occurs when off-label marketing leads to prescriptions being filled and bills for those prescriptions being submitted to medicare / medicaid .
as of *num* , over *num* percent of all federal fca actions were initiated by whistleblowers .
the government recovered $38 .
*num* billion under the false claims act between *num* and *num* and of this amount , $27 .
*num* billion or *num* % was from " qui tam " cases brought by relators .
in *num* , whistleblowers filed over *num* false claims act lawsuits .
in *num* , the department of justice had its third highest annual recovery in false claims act history , obtaining more than $4 .
*num* billion in settlements and judgments from civil cases involving fraud and false claims against the government .
since *num* alone , the federal government has recovered $31 .
*num* billion in false claims act settlements and judgments .
the act establishes liability when any person or entity improperly receives from or avoids payment to the federal government ( tax fraud is excepted ) .
the act prohibits : certain claims are not actionable , including : there are unique procedural requirements in false claims act cases .
for example : in addition , the fca contains an anti-retaliation provision , which allows a relator to recover , in addition to his award for reporting fraud , double damages plus attorney fees for any acts of retaliation for reporting fraud against the government .
this provision specifically provides relators with a personal claim of double damages for harm suffered and reinstatement .
under the false claims act , the department of justice is authorized to pay rewards to those who report fraud against the federal government and are not convicted of a crime related to the fraud , in an amount of between *num* and *num* ( but up to *num* percent in some cases ) of what it recovers based upon the whistleblower's report .
the relator's share is determined based on the fca itself , legislative history , department of justice guidelines released in *num* , and court decisions .
( false claims act amendments on may *num* , *num* , the fraud enforcement and recovery act of *num* ( fera ) was signed into law .
it includes the most significant amendments to the fca since the *num* amendments .
fera enacted the following changes : with this revision , the fca now prohibits knowingly ( changes are in bold ) : on march *num* , *num* , the patient protection and affordable care act ( also referred to as the health reform bill or ppaca ) was signed into law by president barack obama .
the affordable care act made further amendments to the false claims act , including : the false claims act has a detailed process for making a claim under the act .
mere complaints to the government agency are insufficient to bring claims under the act .
a complaint ( lawsuit ) must be filed in u .
s .
district court ( federal court ) in camera ( under seal ) .
after an investigation by the department of justice within *num* days , or frequently several months after an extension is granted , the department of justice decides whether it will pursue the case .
if the case is pursued , the amount of the reward is less than if the department of justice decides not to pursue the case and the plaintiff / relator continues the lawsuit himself .
however , the success rate is higher in cases that the department of justice decides to pursue .
technically , the government has several options in handing cases .
these include : in practice , there are two other options for the department of justice : there is case law where claims may be prejudiced if disclosure of the alleged unlawful act has been reported in the press , if complaints were filed to an agency instead of filing a lawsuit , or if the person filing a claim under the act is not the first person to do so .
individual states in the u .
s .
have different laws regarding whistleblowing involving state governments .
the u .
s .
internal revenue service ( irs ) takes the position that , for federal income tax purposes , " qui tam " payments to a relator under fca are ordinary income and not capital gains .
the irs position was challenged by a relator in the case of " alderson v .
united states " and , in *num* , the u .
s .
court of appeals for the ninth circuit upheld the irs ' stance .
as of *num* , this remained the only circuit court decision on tax treatment of these payments .
in a *num* case , " vermont agency of natural resources v .
united states ex rel .
stevens " , *num* u .
s .
*num* ( *num* ) , the united states supreme court held that a private individual may not bring suit in federal court on behalf of the united states against a state ( or state agency ) under the fca .
in " stevens " , the supreme court also endorsed the " partial assignment " approach to " qui tam " relator standing to sue , which had previously been articulated by the ninth circuit federal court of appeals and is an exception to the general legal rule for standing .
in a *num* case , " rockwell international corp .
v .
united states " , the united states supreme court considered several issues relating to the " original source " exception to the fca's public-disclosure bar .
the court held that ( *num* ) the original source requirement of the fca provision setting for the original-source exception to the public-disclosure bar on federal-court jurisdiction is jurisdictional ; ( *num* ) the statutory phrase " information on which the allegations are based " refers to the relator's allegations and not the publicly disclosed allegations ; the terms " allegations " is not limited to the allegations in the original complaint , but includes , at a minimum , the allegations in the original complaint as amended ; ( *num* ) relator's knowledge with respect to the pondcrete fell short of the direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based required for him to qualify as an original source ; and ( *num* ) the government's intervention did not provide an independent basis of jurisdiction with respect to the relator .
in a *num* case , " allison engine co .
v .
united states ex rel .
sanders " , the united states supreme court considered whether a false claim had to be presented directly to the federal government , or if it merely needed to be paid with government money , such as a false claim by a subcontractor to a prime contractor .
the court found that the claim need not be presented directly to the government , but that the false statement must be made with the intention that it will be relied upon by the government in paying , or approving payment of , a claim .
the fraud enforcement and recovery act of *num* reversed the court's decision and made the types of fraud to which the false claims act applies more explicit .
in a *num* case , " united states ex rel .
eisenstein v .
city of new york " , the united states supreme court considered whether , when the government declines to intervene or otherwise actively participate in a " qui tam " action under the false claims act , the united states is a " party " to the suit for purposes of federal rule of appellate procedure *num* ( a ) ( *num* ) ( a ) ( which requires that a notice of appeal in a federal civil action generally be filed within *num* days after entry of a judgment or order from which the appeal is taken ) .
the court held that when the united states has declined to intervene in a privately initiated fca action , it is not a " party " for frap *num* purposes , and therefore , petitioner's appeal filed after *num* days was untimely .
in a *num* case , " universal health services , inc .
v .
united states ex rel .
escobar " , the united states supreme court sought to clarify the standard for materiality under the fca .
the court unanimously upheld the implied certification theory of fca liability and strengthened the fca’s materiality requirement .
as of *num* , thirty states and the district of columbia have also created false-claims statutes to protect their publicly funded programs from fraud by including qui tam provisions , which enables them to recover money at state level .
some of these state false claims act statutes provide similar protections to those of the federal law , while others limit recovery to claims of fraud related to the medicaid program .
the california false claims act was enacted in *num* , but lay relatively dormant until the early 1990s , when public entities , frustrated by what they viewed as a barrage of unjustified and unmeritorious claims , began to employ the false claims act as a defensive measure .
in *num* , the state of texas passed the texas medicaid fraud prevention act ( tmfpa ) , which specifically aims at combatting fraud against the texas medicaid program , which provides healthcare and prescription drug coverage to low-income individuals .
the texas law enacts state qui tam provisions that allow individuals to report fraud and initiate action against violations of the tmfpa , imposes consequences for noncompliance and includes whistleblower protections .
in australia , there have been calls since *num* for legislation modeled on the false claims act and for their application to the tobacco industry and carbon pricing schemes in october *num* , the uk government announced that it is considering the case for financially incentivising individuals reporting fraud in economic crime cases by private sector organisations , in an approach much like the us false claims act .
the ' serious and organised crime strategy' paper released by the uk's secretary of state for the home department sets out how that government plans to take action to prevent serious and organised crime and strengthen protections against and responses to it .
the paper asserts that serious and organised crime costs the uk more than £24 billion a year .
in the context of anti-corruption , the paper acknowledges that there is a need to not only target serious and organised criminals but also support those who seek to help identify and disrupt serious and organised criminality .
three uk agencies , the department for business , innovation & skills , the ministry of justice and the home office have been tasked with considering the case for a us-style false claims act in the uk .
under rule *num* ( b ) of the federal rules of civil procedure , allegations of fraud or mistake must be pleaded with particularity .
all appeals courts to have addressed the issue of whether rule *num* ( b ) pleading standards apply to qui tam actions have held that the heightened standard applies .
the fifth circuit , the sixth circuit , the seventh circuit , the eighth circuit , the tenth circuit , and the eleventh circuit have all found that plaintiffs must allege specific false claims .

in *num* , the american civil liberties union ( aclu ) , government accountability project ( gap ) and omb watch filed suit against the department of justice challenging the constitutionality of the " seal provisions " of the fca that require the whistleblower and the court to keep lawsuits confidential for at least *num* days .
the plaintiffs argued that the requirements infringe the first amendment rights of the public and the whistleblower , and that they violate the division of powers , since courts are not free to release the documents until the executive branch acts .
the government moved for dismissal , and the district court granted that motion in *num* .
the plaintiffs appealed , and in *num* their appeal was denied .
in *num* , a subsidiary of johnson & johnson agreed to pay over $81 million in civil and criminal penalties to resolve allegations in a fca suit filed by two whistleblowers .
the suit alleged that ortho-mcneil-janssen pharmaceuticals , inc .

specifically , the suit alleged that omjpi " illegally marketed topamax by , among other things , promoting the sale and use of topamax for a variety of psychiatric conditions other than those for which its use was approved by the food and drug administration , ( i .
e .
, " off-label " uses ) .

breidablik in norse mythology , breiðablik ( " broad-gleaming " ) is the home of baldr .
it is briefly described in snorri sturluson's " gylfaginning " as one of the halls of asgard : later in the work , when snorri describes baldr , he gives a longer description , citing " grímnismál " , though he does not name the poem : breiðablik is not otherwise mentioned in the eddic sources .
cue sports cue sports ( sometimes written cuesports ) , also known as billiard sports , are a wide variety of games of skill generally played with a cue stick , which is used to strike billiard balls and thereby cause them to move around a cloth-covered billiards table bounded by elastic bumpers known as .
historically , the umbrella term was billiards .
while that familiar name is still employed by some as a generic label for all such games , the word's usage has splintered into more exclusive competing meanings in various parts of the world .
for example , in british and australian english , " billiards " usually refers exclusively to the game of english billiards , while in american and canadian english it is sometimes used to refer to a particular game or class of games , or to all cue games in general , depending upon dialect and context .
in colloquial usage , the term " billiards " may be used colloquially to refer to pocket billiards games , such as pool , snooker , or russian pyramid .
there are *num* major subdivisions of games within cue sports : there are other variants that make use of obstacles and targets , and table-top games played with disks instead of balls .
billiards has a long and rich history stretching from its inception in the *ord* century , to the wrapping of the body of mary , queen of scots , in her billiard table cover in *num* , through its many mentions in the works of shakespeare , including the famous line " let's to billiards " in " antony and cleopatra " ( 1606–07 ) , and through the many famous enthusiasts of the sport such as : mozart , louis xiv of france , marie antoinette , immanuel kant , napoleon , abraham lincoln , mark twain , george washington , french president jules grévy , charles dickens , george armstrong custer , theodore roosevelt , lewis carroll , w .
c .
fields , babe ruth , bob hope , and jackie gleason .
all cue sports are generally regarded to have evolved into indoor games from outdoor stick-and-ball lawn games ( retroactively termed ground billiards ) , and as such to be related to the historical games jeu de mail and palle-malle , and modern trucco , croquet and golf , and more distantly to the stickless bocce and bowls .
the word " billiard " may have evolved from the french word " billart " or " billette " , meaning " stick " , in reference to the , an implement similar to a golf club , which was the forerunner to the modern cue ; the term's origin may have also been from french " bille " , meaning " ball " .
the modern term " cue sports " can be used to encompass the ancestral mace games , and even the modern cueless variants , such as finger billiards , for historical reasons .
" cue " itself came from " queue " , the french word for a tail .
this refers to the early practice of using the tail of the mace to strike the ball when it lay against a .
a recognizable form of billiards was played outdoors in the 1340s , and was reminiscent of croquet .
king louis xi of france ( 1461–1483 ) had the first known indoor billiard table .
louis xiv further refined and popularized the game , and it swiftly spread among the french nobility .
while the game had long been played on the ground , this version appears to have died out in the *ord* century , in favor of croquet , golf and bowling games , while table billiards had grown in popularity as an indoor activity .
mary , queen of scots , claimed that her " table de billiard " had been taken away by those who eventually became her executioners ( and who covered her body with the table's cloth ) .
billiards grew to the extent that by *num* , it was being played in almost every paris café .
in england , the game was developing into a very popular activity for members of the gentry .
by *num* , the thin butt end of the mace began to be used not only for shots under the cushion ( which itself was originally only there as a preventative method to stop balls from rolling off ) , but players increasingly preferred it for other shots as well .
the cue as it is known today was finally developed by about *num* .
initially , the mace was used to push the balls , rather than strike them .
the newly developed striking cue provided a new challenge .
cushions began to be stuffed with substances to allow the balls to rebound , in order to enhance the appeal of the game .
after a transitional period where only the better players would use cues , the cue came to be the first choice of equipment .
the demand for tables and other equipment was initially met in europe by john thurston and other furniture makers of the era .
the early balls were made from wood and clay , but the rich preferred to use ivory .
early billiard games involved various pieces of additional equipment , including the " arch " ( related to the croquet hoop ) , " port " ( a different hoop ) and " king " ( a pin or skittle near the arch ) in the 1770s , but other game variants , relying on the cushions ( and eventually on pockets cut into them ) , were being formed that would go on to play fundamental roles in the development of modern billiards .
the early croquet-like games eventually led to the development of the carom or carambole billiards category – what most non-commonwealth and non-us speakers mean by the word " billiards " .
these games , which once completely dominated the cue sports world but have declined markedly in many areas over the last few generations , are games played with three or sometimes four balls , on a table without holes ( and without obstructions or targets in most cases ) , in which the goal is generally to strike one with a , then have the cue ball rebound off of one or more of the cushions and strike a second object ball .
variations include three-cushion , straight rail and the balkline variants , cushion caroms , five-pins , and four-ball , among others .
over time , a type of obstacle returned , originally as a hazard and later as a target , in the form of pockets , or holes partly cut into the table bed and partly into the cushions , leading to the rise of pocket billiards , including " pool " games such as eight-ball , nine-ball , straight pool and one-pocket ; russian pyramid ; snooker ; english billiards and others .
in the united states pool and billiards had died out for a bit , but between *num* and *num* pool and billiards became very popular .
players in annual championships began to receive their own cigarette cards .
this was mainly due to the fact that it was a popular pastime for troops to take their minds off from battle .
however , by the end of world war ii pool and billiards began to die down once again .
it was not until *num* when the film " the hustler " came out that sparked a new interest in the game .
now the game is generally a well-known game and has many players of all different skill levels .
the games with regulated international professional competition , if not others , have been referred to as " sports " or " sporting " events , not simply " games " , since *num* at the latest .
quite a variety of particular games ( i .
e .
, sets of rules and equipment ) are the subject of present-day competition , including many of those already mentioned , with competition being especially broad in nine-ball , snooker , three-cushion and eight-ball .
snooker , though technically a pocket billiards variant and closely related in its equipment and origin to the game of english billiards , is a professional sport organized at the international level , and its rules bear little resemblance to those of modern pool , pyramid and other such games .
a " billiards " category encompassing pool , snooker and carom was featured in the *num* world games , held in duisburg , germany , and the *num* asian games also saw the introduction of a " cue sports " category .
billiard balls vary from game to game , in size , design and quantity .
russian pyramid and kaisa have a size of *num* mm ( in ) .
in russian pyramid there are sixteen balls , as in pool , but fifteen are white and numbered , and the is usually red .
in kaisa , five balls are used : the yellow ( called the " kaisa " in finnish ) , two red object balls , and the two white cue balls ( usually differentiated by one cue ball having a dot or other marking on it and each of which serves as an object ball for the opponent ) .
carom billiards balls are larger than pool balls , having a diameter of *num* .
*num* mm ( in ) , and come as a set of two cue balls ( one colored or marked ) and an object ball ( or two object balls in the case of the game four-ball ) .
american-style pool balls are *num* mm ( in ) , are used in many pool games found throughout the world , come in sets of two of object balls , seven and seven , an and a ; the balls are racked differently for different games ( some of which do not use the entire ball set ) .
blackball ( english-style eight-ball ) sets are similar , but have unmarked of ( or ) and balls instead of solids and stripes , and at *num* mm ( in ) are smaller than the american-style ; they are used principally in britain , ireland , and some commonwealth countries , though not exclusively , since they are unsuited for playing nine-ball .
snooker balls are smaller than american-style pool balls with a diameter of *num* .
*num* mm ( in ) , and come in sets of *num* ( *num* reds , *num* " " , and a cue ball ) .
english billiard balls are the same size as snooker balls and come in sets of three balls ( two cue balls and a red , an object ball ) .
other games , such as bumper pool , have custom ball sets .
billiard balls have been made from many different materials since the start of the game , including clay , bakelite , celluloid , crystallite , ivory , plastic , steel and wood .
the dominant material from *num* until the early *ord* century was ivory .
the search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters .
it was in part spurred on by a new york billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10 , *num* for a substitute material .
the first viable substitute was celluloid , invented by john wesley hyatt in *num* , but the material was volatile , sometimes exploding during manufacture and was highly flammable .
there are many sizes and styles of pool and billiard tables .
generally , tables are rectangles twice as long as they are wide .
most pool tables are known as 7- , 8- , or 9-footers , referring to the length of the table's long side .
full-size snooker and english billiard tables are long on the longest side .
pool halls tend to have tables and cater to the serious pool player .
pubs will typically use tables which are often coin-operated .
formerly , tables were common , but such tables are now considered antique collectors items ; a few , usually from the late *ord* century , can be found in pool halls from time to time .
ten-foot tables remain the standard size for carom billiard games .
the slates on modern carom tables are usually heated to stave off moisture and provide a consistent playing surface .
the length of the pool table will typically be a function of space , with many homeowners purchasing an table as a compromise .
full-size pool tables are *num* .
*num* by ( interior dimensions ) .
high-quality tables have a made of thick slate , in three pieces to prevent warping and changes due to temperature and humidity .
smaller bar tables are most commonly made with a single piece of slate .
pocket billiards tables of all types normally have six pockets , three on each side ( four corner pockets , and two side or middle pockets ) .
all types of tables are covered with billiard cloth ( often called " felt " , but actually a woven wool or wool / nylon blend called baize ) .
cloth has been used to cover billiards tables since the *ord* century .
bar or tavern tables , which get a lot of play , use " slower " , more durable cloth .
the cloth used in upscale pool ( and snooker ) halls and home billiard rooms is " faster " ( i .
e .
, provides less friction , allowing the balls to roll farther across the table ) , and competition-quality pool cloth is made from *num* % worsted wool .
snooker cloth traditionally has a nap ( consistent fiber directionality ) and balls behave differently when rolling against versus along with the nap .
the cloth of the billiard table has traditionally been green , reflecting its origin ( originally the grass of ancestral lawn games ) , and has been so colored since the *ord* century , but it is also produced in other colors such as red and blue .
television broadcasting of pool as well as *num* cushion billiards prefers a blue colored cloth which was chosen for better visibility and contrast against colored balls .
the cloth was earlier said to be the most important part of the game , most likely because of the reflection of the game's origin .
the players were determined that the cloth should not be ripped – women were made to continue to use maces after cues were invented , for fear that they would rip the cloth with the sharper cues .
a rack is the name given to a frame ( usually wood , plastic or aluminium ) used to organize billiard balls at the beginning of a game .
this is traditionally triangular in shape , but varies with the type of billiards played .
there are two main types of racks ; the more common triangular shape which is used for eight-ball and straight pool and the diamond-shaped rack used for nine-ball .
there are several other types of less common rack types that are also used , based on a " template " to hold the billiard balls tightly together .
most commonly it is a thin plastic sheet with diamond-shaped cut-outs that hold the balls that is placed on the table with the balls set on top of the rack .
the rack is used to set up the " break " and removed before the " break shot " occurs .
billiards games are mostly played with a stick known as a cue .
a cue is usually either a one piece tapered stick or a two piece stick divided in the middle by a joint of metal or phenolic resin .
high quality cues are generally two pieces and are made of a hardwood , generally maple for billiards and ash for snooker .
the end of the cue is of larger circumference and is intended to be gripped by a player's hand .
the of the cue is of smaller circumference , usually tapering to an terminus called a ( usually made of fiberglass or brass in better cues ) , where a rounded leather is affixed , flush with the ferrule , to make final contact with balls .
the tip , in conjunction with chalk , can be used to impart spin to the cue ball when it is not hit in its center .
cheap cues are generally made of pine , low-grade maple ( and formerly often of ramin , which is now endangered ) , or other low-quality wood , with inferior plastic ferrules .
a quality cue can be expensive and may be made of exotic woods and other expensive materials which are artfully inlaid in decorative patterns .
many modern cues are also made , like golf clubs , with high-tech materials such as woven graphite .
skilled players may use more than one cue during a game , including a separate generally lighter cue for the opening break shot ( because of cue speed gained from a lighter stick ) and another , shorter cue with a special tip for .
the mechanical bridge , sometimes called a " rake " , " crutch " , " bridge stick " or simply " bridge " , and in the uk a " rest " , is used to extend a player's reach on a shot where the cue ball is too far away for normal hand bridging .
it consists of a stick with a grooved metal or plastic head which the cue slides on .
many amateurs refuse to use the mechanical bridge based on the perception that to do so is unmanly .
however , many aficionados and most professionals employ the bridge whenever the intended shot so requires .
some players , especially current or former snooker players , use a screw-on cue butt extension instead of or in addition to the mechanical bridge .
bridge head design is varied , and not all designs ( especially those with cue shaft-enclosing rings , or wheels on the bottom of the head ) , are broadly tournament-approved .
in italy a longer , thicker cue is typically available for this kind of tricky shot .
for snooker they are normally available in three forms , their use depending on how the player is hampered ; the standard rest is a simple cross , the ' spider ' has a raised arch around *num* cm with three grooves to rest the cue in and for the most awkward of shots , the ' giraffe ' ( or ' swan ' in england ) which has a raised arch much like the ' spider ' but with a slender arm reaching out around *num* cm with the groove .
chalk is applied to the tip of the cue stick , ideally before every shot , to increase the tip's friction coefficient so that when it impacts the cue ball on a non-center hit , no ( unintentional slippage between the cue tip and the struck ball ) occurs .
cue tip chalk is not actually the substance typically referred to as " chalk " ( generally calcium carbonate ) , but any of several proprietary compounds , with a silicate base .
it was around the time of the industrial revolution that newer compounds formed that provided better grip for the ball .
this is when the english began to experiment with side spin or applying curl to the ball .
this was shortly introduced to the american players and is how the term " putting english on the ball " came to be .
" chalk " may also refer to a cone of fine , white ; like talc ( talcum powder ) it can be used to reduce friction between the cue and bridge hand during shooting , for a smoother stroke .
some brands of hand chalk actually are made of compressed talc .
( tip chalk is not used for this purpose because it is abrasive , hand-staining and difficult to apply .
) many players prefer a slick pool glove over hand chalk or talc because of the messiness of these powders ; buildup of particles on the cloth will affect ball behavior and necessitate more-frequent cloth cleaning .
cue tip chalk ( invented in its modern form by straight rail billiard pro william a .
spinks and chemist william hoskins in *num* ) is made by crushing silica and the abrasive substance corundum or aloxite ( aluminium oxide ) , into a powder .
it is combined with dye ( originally and most commonly green or blue-green , like traditional billiard cloth , but available today , like the cloth , in many colours ) and a binder ( glue ) .
each manufacturer's brand has different qualities , which can significantly affect play .
high humidity can also impair the effectiveness of chalk .
harder , drier compounds are generally considered superior by most players .
there are two main varieties of billiard games : carom and pocket .
the main carom billiards games are straight rail , balkline and especially three cushion billiards .
all are played on a pocketless table with three balls ; two cue balls and one object ball .
in all , players shoot a cue ball so that it makes contact with the opponent's cue ball as well as the object ball .
others of multinational interest are four-ball and five-pins .
the most globally popular of the large variety of pocket games are pool and snooker .
a third , english billiards , has some features of carom billiards .
english billiards used to be one of the two most-competitive cue sports along with the carom game balkline , at the turn of the *ord* century and is still enjoyed today in commonwealth countries .
another pocket game , russian pyramid and its variants like kaisa are popular in the former eastern bloc .
in straight rail , a player scores a point and may continue shooting each time his cue ball makes contact with both other balls .
although a difficult and subtle game , some of the best players of straight billiards developed the skill to the balls in a corner or along the same rail for the purpose of playing a series of to score a seemingly limitless number of points .
the first straight rail professional tournament was held in *num* where jacob schaefer , sr .
scored *num* points in a single turn ( that is , *num* separate strokes without a miss ) .
with the balls repetitively hit and barely moving in endless " nursing " , there was little for the fans to watch .
in light of these phenomenal skill developments in straight rail , the game of balkline soon developed to make it impossible for a player to keep the balls gathered in one part of the table for long , greatly limiting the effectiveness of nurse shots .
a ( not to be confused with , which pertains to the game of english billiards ) is a line parallel to one end of a billiards table .
in the " games " of balkline – *num* .
*num* and *num* .
*num* ( pronounced " eighteen-point-two " ) balkline , among other more obscure variations – the players have to drive at least one object ball past a balkline set at from each rail , after one or two points have been scored , respectively .
a more elegant solution was three-cushion billiards , which requires a player to make contact with the other two balls on the table " and " contact three rail cushions in the process .
this is difficult enough that even the best players can only manage to average one to two points per turn .
this is sometimes described as " hardest to learn " and " require most skill " of all billiards .
even quite good pool or snooker players may attempt an hour or more to score a single three cushion point , without even managing an accidental score .
there are many variations of games played on a standard pool table .
popular pool games include eight-ball , nine-ball , straight pool and one-pocket .
even within games types ( e .
g .
eight-ball ) , there may be variations , and people may play recreationally using relaxed or local rules .
a few of the more popular examples of pool games are given below .
in eight-ball and nine-ball , the object is to sink object balls until one can legally pocket the winning eponymous " " .
well-known but waning in popularity is straight pool , in which players seek to continue sinking balls , rack after rack if they can , to reach a pre-determined winning score ( typically *num* ) .
related to nine-ball , another well-known game is rotation , where the lowest-numbered object ball on the table must be struck first , although any object ball may be pocketed ( i .
e .
, combination shot ) .
each pocketed ball is worth its number , and the player with the highest score at the end of the rack is the winner .
since there are only *num* points available ( *num* + *num* + *num* ⋯ + *num* = *num* ) , scoring *num* points leaves no opportunity for the opponent to catch up .
in both one-pocket and bank pool , the players must sink a set number of balls ; respectively , all in a particular , or all by .
in snooker , players score points by alternately potting and various special " " .
speed pool is a standard billiards game where the balls must be pocketed in as little time as possible .
rules vary greatly from tournament to tournament .
the international speed pool challenge has been held annually since *num* .
dating to approximately *num* , english billiards , called simply billiards in many former british colonies and in the uk where it originated , was originally called the " winning and losing carambole game " , folding in the names of three predecessor games , " the winning game " , " the losing game " and " the carambole game " ( an early form of straight rail ) , that combined to form it .
the game features both ( caroms ) and the pocketing of balls as objects of play .
english billiards requires two and a red .
the object of the game is to score either a fixed number of points , or score the most points within a set time frame , determined at the start of the game .
points are awarded for : snooker is a pocket billiards game originated by british officers stationed in india during the *ord* century , based on earlier pool games such as black pool and life pool .
the name of the game became generalized to also describe one of its prime strategies : to " " the opposing player by causing that player to foul or leave an opening to be exploited .
in the united kingdom , snooker is by far the most popular cue sport at the competitive level , and major national pastime along with association football and cricket .
it is played in many commonwealth countries as well , especially in asia .
snooker is uncommon in north america , where pool games such as eight-ball and nine-ball dominate , and latin america and continental europe , where carom games dominate .
the first world snooker championship was held in *num* , and it has been held annually since then with few exceptions .
the world professional billiards and snooker association ( wpbsa ) was established in *num* to regulate the professional game , while the international billiards and snooker federation ( ibsf ) regulates the amateur games .
technically a form of pocket billiards , snooker has its own worldwide sporting community separate from that of pool .
these combine aspects of carom and pocket billiards , and are played on tables with pockets ( often as s not targets ) .
these are variations using small disks instead of balls , and light-weight cue sticks .
alexander anderson ( mathematician ) alexander anderson ( in aberdeen – in paris ) was a scottish mathematician .
he was born in aberdeen , possibly in *num* , according to a print which suggests he was aged *num* in *num* .
it is unknown where he was educated , but it is likely that he initially studied writing and philosophy ( the " belles lettres " ) in his home city of aberdeen .
he then went to the continent , and was a professor of mathematics in paris by the start of the seventeenth century .
there he published or edited , between the years *num* and *num* , various geometric and algebraic tracts .
he described himself as having " more wisdom than riches " in the dedication of " vindiciae archimedis " ( *num* ) .
he was first cousin of david anderson of finshaugh , a celebrated mathematician , and david anderson's daughter was the mother of mathematician james gregory .
he was selected by the executors of françois viète to revise and edit viète's manuscript works .
viète died in *num* , and it is unclear if anderson knew him , but his eminence was sufficient to attract the attention of the dead man's executors .
anderson corrected and expanded upon viète's manuscripts , which extended known geometry to the new algebra , which used general symbols to represent quantities .
the known works of anderson amount to six thin quarto volumes , and as the last of them was published in *num* , it is probable that the author died soon after that year , but the precise date is unknown .
he wrote other works that have since been lost .
from his last work it appears he wrote another piece , " a treatise on the mensuration of solids , " and copies of two other works , " ex .
math .
" and " stereometria triangulorum sphæricorum " , were in the possession of sir alexander hume until the after the middle of the seventeenth century .
politics of colombia the politics of colombia take place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic , whereby the president of colombia is both head of state and head of government , and of a multi-party system .
executive power is carried out by the government .
legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of congress , the senate and the house of representatives of colombia .
the judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature .
the economist intelligence unit has rated colombia as " flawed democracy " in *num* .
colombia's present constitution , enacted on july *num* , *num* , strengthened the administration of justice with the provision for introduction of an adversarial system which ultimately is to entirely replace the existing napoleonic code .
other significant reforms under the new constitution provide for civil divorce , dual nationality , the election of a vice president , and the election of departmental governors .
the constitution expanded citizens ' basic rights , including that of " tutela , " under which an immediate court action can be requested by an individual if he or she feels that their constitutional rights are being violated and if there is no other legal recourse .
the national government has separate executive , legislative , and judicial branches .
the president is elected for a four-year term and , since *num* , can be re-elected for one consecutive term .
the *num* constitution reestablished the position of vice president , who is elected on the same ticket as the president .
by law , the vice president will succeed in the event of the president's resignation , illness , or death .
colombia's bicameral congress consists of a 102-member senate of colombia and a 161-member chamber of representatives of colombia .
senators are elected on the basis of a nationwide ballot , while representatives are elected in multi member districts co-located within the *num* national departments .
the country's capital is a separate capital district and elects its own representatives .
members may be re-elected indefinitely , and , in contrast to the previous system , there are no alternate congressmen .
congress meets twice a year , and the president has the power to call it into special session when needed .
the civilian judiciary is a separate and independent branch of government .
guidelines and the general structure for colombia's administration of justice are set out in law *num* of march *num* , *num* .
colombia's legal system has recently begun to incorporate some elements of an oral , accusatory system .
the judicial branch's general structure is composed of four distinct jurisdictions ( ordinary , administrative , constitutional , and special ) .
colombia's highest judicial organs are the supreme court , the council of state , the constitutional court , and the superior judicial council .
although all the high courts technically oversee separate jurisdictions , the constitutional court has a broad spectrum of judicial oversight which often allows it to rule on issues overseen by different jurisdictions and even weigh in directly in the rulings of other high courts .

diprotodon diprotodon , meaning " two forward teeth " , is the largest known marsupial to have ever lived .
along with many other members of a group of species collectively known as the " australian megafauna " , it existed from approximately *num* .
*num* million years ago until extinction some *num* , *num* years ago ( through most of the pleistocene epoch ) .
"diprotodon " species fossils have been found in sites across mainland australia , including complete skulls and skeletons , as well as hair and foot impressions .
female skeletons have been found with babies located where the mother's pouch would have been .
the largest specimens were hippopotamus-sized : about from nose to tail , standing tall at the shoulder and weighing about .
aboriginal rock art images in quinkan traditional country ( queensland , australia ) have been claimed to depict diprotodonts .
they inhabited open forest , woodlands , and grasslands , possibly staying close to water , and eating leaves , shrubs , and some grasses .
the closest surviving relatives of " diprotodon " are the wombats and the koala .
it is suggested that diprotodonts may have been an inspiration for the legends of the bunyip , as some aboriginal tribes identify " diprotodon " bones as those of " bunyips " .
the first recorded " diprotodon " remains were discovered in a cave near wellington in new south wales in the early 1830s by bushman george ranken and major thomas mitchell ; the latter sent them to england for study by sir richard owen .
in the 1840s ludwig leichhardt discovered many " diprotodon " bones eroding from the banks of creeks in the darling downs of queensland and when reporting the find to owen commented that the remains were so well preserved he expected to find living examples in the then-unexplored central regions of australia .
the majority of fossil finds are of demographic groups indicative of diprotodonts dying in drought conditions .
for example , hundreds of individuals were found in lake callabonna with well-preserved lower bodies but crushed and distorted heads .
it is theorised several family groups sank in mud while crossing the drying lake bed .
other finds consist of age groupings of young or old animals which are first to die during a drought .
in *num* , a significant group of about *num* was found at eulo , south-west queensland .
"diprotodon " was named by owen ( *num* ) .
it was assigned to diprotodontidae by mckenna and bell ( *num* ) .
the historical classification of " diprotodon " consisted of eight species ( " diprotodon optatum " owen , *num* ; " diprotodon australis " owen , *num* ; " d .
annextans " mccoy , *num* ; " d .
minor " huxley , *num* ; " d .
longiceps " mccoy *num* ; " d .
loderi " krefft , 1873a ; " d .
bennettii " krefft , 1873b ( nec " d .
bennettii " owen , *num* ) ; and " d .
bennettii " owen , *num* ( nec " d .
bennettii " krefft , 1873b ) ; based on size or slight morphological differences of single specimens collected from isolated geographic regions .
bimodal dental sizes , rather than a continuum of tooth sizes , and identical male and female dental morphology , indicate sexual dimorphism instead of separate species , thus providing strong evidence that the eight species are synonyms for " d .
optatum " .
"diprotodon " superficially resembled a rhinoceros without a horn .
its feet turned inwards like a wombat’s , giving it a pigeon-toed appearance .
it had strong claws on the front feet and its pouch opening faced backwards .
footprints of its feet have been found showing a covering of hair which indicates it had a coat similar to a modern wombat .
until recently it was unknown how many species of " diprotodon " had existed .
eight species are described although many researchers believed these actually represented only three at most while some estimated there could be around twenty in total .
recent research compared the variation between all of the described " diprotodon " species with the variation in one of australia’s largest living marsupials , the eastern grey kangaroo , and found the range was comparable , with a near continent-wide distribution .
this left only two possible " diprotodon " species differing only in size with the smaller being around half the size of the larger .
according to gause’s " competitive exclusion principle " no two species with identical ecological requirements can coexist in a stable environment .
however , both the small and large diprotodonts coexisted throughout the pleistocene and the size difference is similar to other sexually dimorphic living marsupials .
further evidence is the battle damage common in competing males found on the larger specimens but absent from the smaller .
dental morphology also supports sexual dimorphism , with highly sexually dimorphic marsupials , such as the grey kangaroo , having different tooth sizes between males and females , but both sexes having the same dental morphology .
an identical dental morphology occurs in the large and small " diprotodon " .
the taxonomic implication is that owen’s original " diprotodon optatum " is the only valid species .
a single sexually dimorphic species allows behavioural interpretations .
all sexually dimorphic species of over exhibit a polygynous breeding strategy .
a modern example of this is the gender segregation of elephants where females and the young form family groups while lone males fight for the right to mate with all the females of the group .
this behaviour is consistent with fossil finds where adult / juvenile fossil assemblages usually contain only female adult remains .
cyclic variations in the strontium isotope ratios within the tooth enamel of a *num* , *num* year old fossil imply that " diprotodon " undertook seasonal migrations , making it the only known extinct or extant metatherian to do so .
the carbon-13 enamel content was found to have little variation , suggesting a relatively consistent diet through the course of a year containing a mix of both c and c plants .
most modern researchers including richard roberts and tim flannery argue that diprotodonts , along with a wide range of other australian megafauna , became extinct shortly after humans arrived in australia about *num* , *num* years ago .
some older researchers including richard wright argue on the contrary that diprotodont remains from several sites , such as tambar springs and trinkey and lime springs suggest that " diprotodon " survived much longer , into the holocene .
other more recent researchers , including lesley head and judith field , favour an extinction date of *num* , *num* - *num* , *num* years ago , which would mean that humans coexisted with " diprotodon " for some *num* , *num* years .
however , opponents of " late extinction " theories have interpreted such late dates based on indirect dating methods as artifacts resulting from redeposition of skeletal material into more recent strata , and recent direct dating results obtained with new technologies have tended to confirm this interpretation .
three theories have been advanced to explain the mass extinction .
australia has undergone a very long process of gradual aridification since it split off from gondwanaland about *num* million years ago .
from time to time the process reversed for a period , but overall the trend has been strongly toward lower rainfall .
the recent ice ages produced no significant glaciation in mainland australia but long periods of cold and very dry weather .
this dry weather during the last ice age may have killed off all the large diprotodonts .
critics point out a number of problems with this theory .
first , large diprotodonts had already survived a long series of similar ice ages , and there does not seem to be any particular reason the most recent one should have achieved what all the previous ice ages had failed to do .
also , climate change apparently peaked *num* , *num* years " after " the extinctions .
finally , even during climatic extremes , some parts of the continent always remain relatively exempt : for example , the tropical north stays fairly warm and wet in all climatic circumstances ; alpine valleys are less affected by drought , and so on .
the overkill theory is that human hunters killed and ate the diprotodonts , causing their extinction .
the extinctions appear to have coincided with the arrival of humans on the continent , and in broad terms , " diprotodon " was the largest and least well-defended species that died out .
similar hunting-out happened with the megafauna of new zealand , madagascar and many smaller islands around the world ( such as new caledonia , cyprus , crete and at least in part , in the americas ) , probably within a thousand years or so .
recent finds of " diprotodon " bones which appear to display butchering marks lend support to this theory .
critics of this theory regard it as simplistic , arguing that ( unlike new zealand and america ) there is little direct evidence of hunting , and that the dates on which the theory rests are too uncertain to be relied on .
however , the high-resolution chronology of the changes supports the hypothesis that human hunting alone eliminated the megafauna .
the third theory says that humans indirectly caused the extinction of diprotodonts , by destroying the ecosystem on which they depended .
in particular , early aboriginal people are thought to have been fire-stick farmers using fire regularly and persistently to drive game , open up dense thickets of vegetation , and create fresh green regrowth for both humans and game animals to eat .
evidence for the fire hypothesis is the sudden increase in widespread ash deposits at the time that people arrived in australia , as well as land-management and hunting practices of modern aboriginal people as recorded by the earliest european settlers before aboriginal society was devastated by european contact and disease .
evidence against the hypothesis is the fact that humans appear to have eliminated the megafauna of tasmania without using fire to modify the environment there .
the above hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive .
each of proposed mechanisms can potentially support the other two .
for example , while burning an area of fairly thick forest and thus turning it into a more open , grassy environment might reduce the viability of a large browser ( an animal that eats leaves and shoots rather than grasses ) , the reverse could also be true : removing the browsing animals ( by eating them , or by any other means ) within a few years produces a very thick undergrowth which , when a fire eventually starts through natural causes ( as fires tend to do every few hundred years ) , burns with greater than usual ferocity .
the burnt-out area is then repopulated with a greater proportion of fire-loving plant species ( notably eucalypts , some acacias , and most of the native grasses ) which are unsuitable habitat for most browsing animals .
either way , the trend is toward the modern australian environment of highly flammable open sclerophyllous forests , woodlands and grasslands , none of which are suitable for large , slow-moving browsing animals—and either way , the changed microclimate produces substantially less rainfall .
an examination of swamp sediment cores spanning the last *num* , *num* years from lynch's crater in queensland suggests that hunting may have been the primary cause of the extinction .
analysis of " sporormiella " fungal spores ( which derive mainly from the dung of megaherbivores ) in the cores shows that the megafauna of that region virtually disappeared about *num* , *num* years ago , at a time when climate changes were minimal ; the change was accompanied by an increase in charcoal , and was followed by a transition from rainforest to fire-tolerant sclerophyll vegetation .
the high-resolution chronology of the changes indicates that fire increased about a century after the disappearance of browsing megafauna , probably due to accumulation of fuel .
grass increased over the next several centuries ; sclerophyll vegetation increased following a lag of another century , and a sclerophyll forest developed about a thousand years later .
earlier increases in sclerophyll vegetation during shifts to cooler , drier conditions about *num* , *num* and *num* , *num* years ago did not have any obvious impact on megafaunal abundance .

, approximately *num* , *num* , *num* us households ( *num* .
*num* % of television subscribers ) receive fox news .
murdoch is the current executive chairman and suzanne scott is the ceo .
fox news has been described as practicing biased reporting in favor of the republican party , the george w .
bush and donald trump administrations and conservative causes while slandering the democratic party and spreading harmful propaganda intended to negatively affect its members ' electoral performances .
critics have cited the channel as detrimental to the integrity of news overall .
fox news employees have said that news reporting operates independently of its opinion and commentary programming , and have denied bias in news reporting , while former employees have said that fox ordered them to " slant the news in favor of conservatives .
" in may *num* , australian publisher rupert murdoch announced he and american industrialist and philanthropist marvin davis intended to develop " a network of independent stations as a fourth marketing force " to compete directly with cbs , nbc , and abc through the purchase of six television stations owned by metromedia .
in july *num* , *ord* century fox announced murdoch had completed his purchase of *num* % of fox filmed entertainment , the parent company of *ord* century fox film corporation .
a year later , *ord* century fox earned $5 .
*num* million in its fiscal third period ended may *num* , *num* , in contrast to a loss of $55 .
*num* million in the third period of the previous year .
subsequently , and prior to founding fnc , murdoch had gained experience in the 24-hour news business when news corporation's bskyb subsidiary began europe's first 24-hour news channel ( sky news ) in the united kingdom in *num* .
with the success of his fourth network efforts in the united states , experience gained from sky news and the turnaround of *ord* century fox , murdoch announced on january *num* , *num* , that news corp .
would launch a 24-hour news channel on cable and satellite systems in the united states as part of a news corp .
" worldwide platform " for fox programming : " the appetite for news – particularly news that explains to people how it affects them – is expanding enormously " .
in february *num* , after former u .
s .
republican party political strategist and nbc executive roger ailes left cable television channel america's talking ( now msnbc ) , murdoch asked him to start fox news channel .
ailes demanded five months of 14-hour workdays and several weeks of rehearsal shows before its launch on october *num* , *num* .
at its debut *num* million households were able to watch fnc ; however , it was absent from the media markets of new york city and los angeles .
rolling news coverage during the day consisted of 20-minute single-topic shows such as " fox on crime " or " fox on politics " , surrounded by news headlines .
interviews featured facts at the bottom of the screen about the topic or the guest .
the flagship newscast at the time was " the schneider report " , with mike schneider's fast-paced delivery of the news .
during the evening , fox featured opinion shows : " the o'reilly report " ( later " the o'reilly factor " ) , " the crier report " ( hosted by catherine crier ) and " hannity & colmes " .
from the beginning , fnc has placed heavy emphasis on visual presentation .
graphics were designed to be colorful and gain attention ; this helped the viewer to grasp the main points of what was being said , even if they could not hear the host ( with on-screen text summarizing the position of the interviewer or speaker , and " bullet points " when a host was delivering commentary ) .
fox news also created the " fox news alert " , which interrupted its regular programming when a breaking news story occurred .
to accelerate its adoption by cable providers , fox news paid systems up to $11 per subscriber to distribute the channel .
this contrasted with the normal practice , in which cable operators paid stations carriage fees for programming .
when time warner bought ted turner's turner broadcasting system , a federal antitrust consent decree required time warner to carry a second all-news channel in addition to its own cnn on its cable systems .
time warner selected msnbc as the secondary news channel , not fox news .
fox news claimed this violated an agreement ( to carry fox news ) .
citing its agreement to keep its u .
s .
headquarters and a large studio in new york city , news corporation enlisted the help of mayor rudolph giuliani's administration to pressure time warner cable ( one of the city's two cable providers ) to transmit fox news on a city-owned channel .
city officials threatened to take action affecting time warner's cable franchises in the city .
during the september *num* , *num* attacks , fox news was the first news organization to run a news ticker on the bottom of the screen to keep up with the flow of information that day .
the ticker has remained , informing viewers about additional news which reporters may not mention on-screen and repeating news mentioned during a broadcast ; it has proven popular with viewers .

fox news channel originally used the slogan " fair and balanced " , which was coined by network co-founder roger ailes while the network was being established .
" the new york times " described the slogan as being a " blunt signal that fox news planned to counteract what mr .
ailes and many others viewed as a liberal bias ingrained in television coverage by establishment news networks .
" in august *num* , fox sued comedian al franken over his use of the slogan as a subtitle for his book , " lies and the lying liars who tell them : a fair and balanced look at the right " , which is critical of fox news channel .
the lawsuit was dropped three days later , after judge denny chin refused its request for an injunction .
in his decision , chin ruled the case was " wholly without merit , both factually and legally " .
he went on to suggest that fox news ' trademark on the phrase " fair and balanced " could be invalid .
in december *num* , fnc won a legal battle concerning the slogan , when alternet filed a cancellation petition with the united states patent and trademark office ( uspto ) to have fnc's trademark rescinded as inaccurate .
alternet included the documentary film " outfoxed " as supporting evidence in its case .
after losing early motions , alternet withdrew its petition ; the uspto dismissed the case .
in *num* , fnc used the slogan " we report , you decide " , referring to " you decide *num* " ( fnc's original slogan for its coverage of election issues ) .
in august *num* , fox news channel began to quietly phase out the " fair and balanced " slogan in favor of " most watched , most trusted " ; when these changes were reported in june *num* by gabriel sherman ( a writer who had written a biography on ailes ) , a network executive said the change " has nothing to do with programming or editorial decisions .
" it was speculated by media outlets that fox news channel was wishing to distance itself from ailes ' tenure at the network .
in march *num* , the network introduced a new ad campaign , " real news .
real honest opinion .
" the ad campaign is intended to promote the network's opinion-based programming and counter perceptions surrounding " fake news " .
fox news still keeps both the " fair & balanced " and " most watched .
most trusted .
" slogans .
fox news provided extensive coverage of the *num* benghazi attack , which host sean hannity described in december *num* as " the story that the mainstream media ignores " and " obviously , a cover-up .
and we will get to the bottom of it .
" programming analysis by media matters found that during the twenty months following the benghazi attacks , fnc ran *num* , *num* segments on the issue , including : over nearly four years after the benghazi attack , there were ten official investigations , including six by republican-controlled house committees .
none of the investigations found any evidence of scandal , cover-up or lying by obama administration officials .
on june *num* , *num* , fox news broadcast a segment by news anchor bret baier entitled " whatever happened to the benghazi investigation ? " which repeated some of the accusations the network had previously made about susan rice and hillary clinton , but for which the women had been exonerated by the official investigations .
from *num* into *num* , fox news broadcast extensive coverage of an alleged scandal surrounding the sale of uranium one to russian interests , which host sean hannity characterized as " one of the biggest scandals in american history .
" the fox news coverage extended throughout the programming day , with particular emphasis by hannity .
the network promoted an ultimately unfounded narrative asserting that , as secretary of state , hillary clinton personally approved the uranium one sale in exchange for $145 million in bribes paid to the clinton foundation .
donald trump repeated these allegations as a candidate and as president .
no evidence of wrongdoing by clinton had been found after three years of allegations , an fbi investigation , and the *num* appointment of a federal attorney to evaluate the investigation .
in november *num* , fox news host shepard smith concisely debunked the alleged scandal , infuriating viewers who suggested he should work for cnn or msnbc .
hannity later called smith " clueless , " while smith stated , " i get it , that some of our opinion programming is there strictly to be entertaining .
i get that .
i don't work there .
i wouldn't work there .
" fox news channel has been widely described as providing biased reporting in favor of conservative political positions , the republican party and president donald trump .
political scientist jonathan bernstein described fox news as an expanded part of the republican party .
political scientists matt grossmann and david a .
hopkins write that fox news has helped " republicans communicate with their base and spread their ideas , and they have been effective in mobilizing voters to participate in midterm elections ( as in *num* and *num* ) .
" prior to *num* , fox news lacked an ideological tilt , and even had more democrats watch the channel than republicans .
during the *num* presidential election , fox news was markedly more hostile in its coverage of democratic presidential nominee john kerry , and distinguished itself among cable news outlets for heavy coverage of the swift boat smear campaign against kerry .
during obama's first term in office , fox news helped launch and amplify the tea party movement , a conservative movement within the republican party that organized protests against obama and his policies .
during the republican primaries , fox news was widely perceived as trying to prevent trump from clinching the nomination .
however , according to " politico " , under trump's presidency , fox news remade itself into his image , as nearly no criticism could be heard of trump on fox news ' prime-time shows .
even in fox news ' news reporting , the network dedicated far more coverage to hillary clinton-related stories , which critics say was intended to deflect attention from the investigation into russian interference in the *num* election .
trump provided great access to fox news during his presidency , giving *num* interviews to the channel while only *num* in total to other news channels by november *num* ; " the new york times " described trump's fox news interviews as " softball interviews " and some of the interviewers ' interview styles as " fawning " ; similarly , " the economist " has described the network's coverage of trump's presidency as " reliably fawning .
" from *num* to *num* , the fox news prime-time line-up changed from one that was skeptical and questioning of trump to a " trump safe space , with a dose of bannonist populism once considered on the fringe .
" the fox news website has also gotten more extreme in its rhetoric since the election of donald trump ; according to columbia's tow center for digital journalism , the fox news website has " gone a little breitbart " over time .
at the start of *num* , fox news mostly ignored prominent scandals in the trump administration which received ample coverage in other national media outlets , such as white house staff secretary rob porter's resignation amid domestic abuse allegations , the downgrading of jared kushner's security clearance and the existence of a non-disclosure agreement between trump and the porn star stormy daniels .
a *num* study found fox news gave disproportionate attention to polls suggesting low approval for president bill clinton .
a *num* study found fox news was less likely to pick up stories that reflected well on democrats , and more likely to pick up stories that reflected well on republicans .
a *num* study comparing fox news channel's " special report with brit hume " and nbc's " nightly news " coverage of the wars in iraq and afghanistan during *num* concluded " fox news was much more sympathetic to the administration than nbc " , suggesting " if scholars continue to find evidence of a partisan or ideological bias at fnc .
.
.
they should consider fox as alternative , rather than mainstream , media " .
research also suggests fox news increases republican vote shares and makes republican politicians more partisan .
a *num* study , using the introduction of fox news into local markets ( 1996–2000 ) as an instrumental variable , found that in the *num* presidential election " republicans gained *num* .
*num* to *num* .
*num* percentage points in the towns that broadcast fox news " , suggesting " fox news convinced *num* to *num* percent of its viewers to vote republican , depending on the audience measure " .
these results were confirmed by a *num* study .
a *num* study , using the same instrumental variable , found congressional " representatives become less supportive of president clinton in districts where fox news begins broadcasting than similar representatives in similar districts where fox news was not broadcast .
" a *num* study , using channel positions as an instrumental variable , found " fox news increases republican vote shares by *num* .
*num* points among viewers induced into watching *num* .
*num* additional minutes per week by variation in position .
" another *num* paper found fox news viewing increased republican vote shares among voters who identified as republican or independent .
fox news publicly denies it is biased , with murdoch and ailes saying have included murdoch's statement that fox has " given room to both sides , whereas only one side had it before " .
fox news host chris wallace has said , " i think we are the counter-weight [ to nbc news ] .
.
.
they have a liberal agenda , and we tell the other side of the story .
" in *num* , robert greenwald's documentary film " " argued fox news had a conservative bias and featured clips from fox news and internal memos from editorial vice president john moody directing fox news staff on how to report certain subjects .
a leaked memo from fox news vice president bill sammon to news staff at the height of the health care reform in the united states debate has been cited as an example of the pro-republican party bias of fox news .
his memo asked the staff to " use the term ' government-run health insurance , ' or , when brevity is a concern , ' government option , ' whenever possible " .
the memo was sent shortly after republican pollster frank luntz advised sean hannity on his fox show , " if you call it a public option , the american people are split .
if you call it the government option , the public is overwhelmingly against it " .
surveys suggest fox news is widely perceived to be ideological .
a *num* pew survey found fox news is viewed as the most ideological channel in america , with *num* percent of those surveyed said fox news is " mostly conservative " , *num* percent said " mostly liberal " and *num* percent said " neither " .
in comparison , msnbc had *num* percent identify it as " mostly liberal " , *num* percent as " mostly conservative " and *num* percent as " neither " .
cnn had *num* percent describe it as " mostly liberal " , *num* percent as " mostly conservative " and *num* percent as " neither " .

it found *num* percent believed fox news delivers news with neither a conservative or liberal bias , compared with *num* percent who said npr delivers news with no conservative or liberal bias and *num* percent who said the same of cnn .
david carr , media critic for " the new york times " , praised the *num* presidential election results coverage on fox news for the network's response to republican adviser and fox news contributor karl rove challenging its call that barack obama would win ohio and the election .
fox's prediction was correct .
carr wrote : a may *num* study conducted by harvard university's shorenstein center on media , politics and public policy examined coverage of trump's first *num* days in office by several major mainstream media outlets including fox .
it found trump received *num* % negative coverage from the overall media , and received the least negative coverage on fox – *num* % negative and *num* % positive .
on march *num* , *num* , andrew napolitano , a fox news commentator , claimed on " fox & friends " that british intelligence agency gchq had wiretapped donald trump on behalf of barack obama during the *num* united states presidential election .
on march *num* , *num* , white house spokesman sean spicer repeated the claim .
when trump was questioned about the claim at a news conference , he said " all we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television .
i didn't make an opinion on it .
" on march *num* , *num* , shepard smith , a fox news anchor , admitted the network had no evidence that trump was under surveillance .
british officials said the white house was backing off the claim .
napolitano was later suspended by fox news for making the claim .
in june *num* , fox news executives instructed producers to head off inappropriate remarks made on the shows aired by the network by hosts and commentators .
the instructions came after a number of fox news hosts and guests made incendiary comments about the trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents .
fox news host laura ingraham had likened the child detention centers that the children were in to " summer camps " .
guest corey lewandowski mocked the story of a 10-year-old child with down's syndrome being separated from her mother ; the fox news host did not address lewandowski's statement .
guest ann coulter falsely claimed that the separated children were " child actors " ; the fox news host did not challenge her claim .
in a segment on trump's alleged use of racial dog whistles , one fox news contributor told an african-american whom he was debating , " you're out of your cotton-picking mind .
" according to the *num* book " asymmetric politics " by political scientists matt grossmann and david a .
hopkins , fox news tends to raise the profile of scandals and controversies involving democrats that receive scant attention in other media , such as the relationship between barack obama and william ayers .
.
.
hillary clinton's role in the fatal *num* attacks on the american consulate in benghazi , libya ; the gun-running scandal known as " fast and furious " ; the business practices of federal loan guarantee recipient solyndra ; the past activism of obama white house operative van jones ; the *num* attacks on john kerry by the swift boat veterans for truth ; the controversial sermons of obama's chicago pastor jeremiah wright ; the filming of undercover videos of supposed wrongdoing by the liberal activist group acorn ; and even the " war on christmas " supposedly waged every december by secular , multicultural liberals .
" in october *num* , fox news ran laudatory coverage of a meeting between trump-supporting rapper kanye west and president trump in the oval office .
fox news had previously run negative coverage of rappers and their involvement with democratic politicians and causes , such as when fox news ran headlines describing conscious hip-hop artist common as " vile " and a " cop-killer rapper " , and when fox news ran negative coverage of kanye west before he became a trump supporter .
on november *num* , *num* , trump's website , donaldjtrump .
com , announced in a press release that fox news host sean hannity would make a " special guest appearance " with trump at a midterm campaign rally the following night in cape girardeau , missouri .
the following morning , hannity tweeted " to be clear , i will not be on stage campaigning with the president .
" hannity appeared at the president's lectern on stage at the rally , immediately mocking the " fake news " at the back of the auditorium , fox news reporters among them .
several fox news employees expressed outrage at hannity's actions , with one stating , " a new line was crossed .
" hannity later asserted that his action was not pre-planned , and fox news stated it " does not condone any talent participating in campaign events .
" fox news host jeanine pirro also appeared on stage with trump at the rally .
the trump press release was later removed from trump's website .
on october *num* , *num* , when special counsel robert s .
mueller iii indicted paul manafort and rick gates , and revealed george papadopoulos had plead guilty ( all of whom were involved in the trump *num* campaign ) , this was the focus of most media's coverage , except fox news ' .
hosts and guests on fox news called for mueller to be fired .
sean hannity and tucker carlson focused their shows on unsubstantiated allegations that clinton sold uranium to russia in exchange for donations to the clinton foundation and on the clinton campaign's role in funding the donald trump–russia dossier .
hannity asserted , " the very thing they are accusing president trump of doing , they did it themselves .
" during the segment , hannity mistakenly referred to clinton as president clinton .
fox news dedicated extensive coverage to the uranium story , which democrats said was an attempt to distract from mueller's intensifying investigation .
" cnn " described the coverage as " a tour de force in deflection and dismissal .
" on october *num* , " cnn " reported fox news employees were dissatisfied with their outlet's coverage of the russia investigation , with employees calling it an " embarrassment " , " laughable " and saying it " does the viewer a huge disservice and further divides the country " and that it is " another blow to journalists at fox who come in every day wanting to cover the news in a fair and objective way " .
when the investigation by special counsel robert mueller into russian interference in the *num* presidential election intensified in october *num* , the focus of fox news coverage turned " what they see as the scandal and wrongdoing of president trump's political opponents .
in reports like these , bill and hillary clinton are prominent and recurring characters because they are considered the real conspirators working with the russians to undermine american democracy .
" paul waldman of the " washington post " described the coverage as " no puppet .
you're the puppet " , saying it was a " careful , coordinated , and comprehensive strategy " to distract from mueller's investigation .
german lopes of " vox " said fox news ' coverage has reached " levels of self-parody " as it dedicated coverage to low-key stories , such as a controversial newsweek op-ed and hamburger emojis , while other networks had wall-to-wall coverage of mueller's indictments .
a " fivethirtyeight " analysis of russia-related media coverage in cable news found most mentions of russia on fox news were spoken in close proximity to " uranium " and " dossier " .
on november *num* , *num* , " vox " analyzed the transcripts of fox news , cnn and msnbc , and found fox news " was unable to talk about the mueller investigation without bringing up hillary clinton " , " talked significantly less about george papadopoulos — the trump campaign adviser whose plea deal with mueller provides the most explicit evidence thus far that the campaign knew of the russian government's efforts to help trump — than its competitors " , and " repeatedly called mueller's credibility into question " .
in december *num* , fox news escalated its attacks on the mueller investigation , with hosts and guest commentators suggesting the investigation amounted to a coup .
guest co-host kevin jackson referred to a right-wing conspiracy theory claiming strzok's messages are evidence of a plot by fbi agents to assassinate trump , a claim which the other fox co-hosts quickly said is not supported by any credible evidence .
fox news host jeanine pirro called the mueller investigation team a " criminal cabal " and said the team ought to be arrested .
other fox news figures referred to the investigation as " corrupt " , " crooked " and " illegitimate " , and likened the fbi to the kgb , the soviet-era spy organization that routinely tortured and summarily executed people .
political scientists and scholars of coups described the fox news rhetoric as scary and dangerous .
experts on coups rejected that the mueller investigation amounted to a coup ; rather , the fox news rhetoric was dangerous to democracy and mirrored the kind of rhetoric that occurs before purges .
a number of observers argued the fox news rhetoric was intended to discredit the mueller investigation and sway president donald trump to fire mueller .
in august *num* , fox news was criticized for giving more prominent coverage of a murder committed by an undocumented immigrant than the convictions of donald trump's former campaign manager , paul manafort , and his long-term personal attorney , michael cohen .
at the same time , most other national mainstream media gave wall-to-wall coverage of the convictions .
fox news hosts dana perrino and jason chaffetz argued that voters care far more about the murder than the convictions of the president's former top aides , and hosts tucker carlson and sean hannity downplayed the convictions .
in november *num* , in the immediate aftermath of the *num* new york city truck attack wherein a terrorist shouted " allahu akbar " , fox news distorted a statement by jake tapper to make it appear as if he had said " allahu akbar " can be used under the most " beautiful circumstances " .
fox news omitted that tapper had said the use of " allahu akbar " in the terrorist attack was not one of these beautiful circumstances .
a headline on foxnews .
com was preceded by a tag reading " outrageous " .
the fox news twitter account distorted the statement even more , saying " jake tapper says ' allahu akbar ' is ' beautiful ' right after nyc terror attack " in a tweet that was later deleted .
tapper chastised fox news for choosing to " deliberately lie " and said " there was a time when one could tell the difference between fox and the nutjobs at infowars .
it's getting tougher and tougher .
lies are lies .
" tapper had in *num* , while a white house correspondent for abc news , come to the defense of fox news when obama criticized the network for not being a legitimate news organization .
fox news guest host jason chaffetz apologized to tapper for misrepresenting his statement .
after fox news had deleted the tweet , sean hannity repeated the misrepresentation and called tapper " liberal fake news cnn's fake jake tapper " and mocked his ratings .
in july *num* , a report by fox & friends falsely said " the new york times " had disclosed intelligence in one of its stories and that this intelligence disclosure helped abu bakr al-baghdadi , the leader of the islamic state , to evade capture .
the report cited an inaccurate assertion by gen .
tony thomas , the head of the united states special operations command , that a major newspaper had disclosed the intelligence .
fox news said it was the " new york times " , repeatedly running the chyron " nyt foils u .
s .
attempt to take out al-bahgdadi " .
pete hegseth , one of the show's hosts , criticized the " failing new york times " .
president donald trump tweeted about the fox & friends report shortly after it first aired , saying " the failing " new york times " foiled u .
s .
attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist , al-baghdadi .
their sick agenda over national security .
" fox news later updated the story , but without apologizing to the " new york times " or responding directly to the inaccuracies .
in a " washington post " column , erik wemple said chris wallace had covered " the new york times " story himself on " fox news sunday " .
" here's another case of the differing standards between fox news's opinion operation " , which has given " a state-run vibe on all matters related to trump " , compared to fox news's news operation , which has provided " mostly sane coverage .
" according to the fact-checking website climate feedback , fox news is part of " a network of unreliable outlets for climate news .
" a *num* study found fox news " takes a more dismissive tone toward climate change than cnn and msnbc " .
a *num* study found fox news emphasized the scientific uncertainty of climate change more than cnn , was less likely to say climate change was real , and more likely to interview climate change skeptics .
in *num* , the hosts of fox & friends described climate change as " unproven science " , a " disputed fact " , and criticized the department of education for working together with nickelodeon to teach children about climate change .
in *num* , sean hannity described the scientific consensus on climate change as " phony science from the left .
" in *num* , he falsely alleged , " scientists still can't agree on whether the global warming is scientific fact or fiction " .
in *num* , hannity said the so-called " climategate " – the leaking of e-mails by climate scientist that climate change skeptics claimed demonstrated scientific misconduct but which all subsequent enquiries have found no evidence of misconduct or wrongdoing – a " scandal " that " exposed global warming as a myth cooked up by alarmists .
" hannity frequently invites contrarian fringe scientists and critics of climate change to his shows .
shepard smith has drawn attention for being one of few voices on fox news to forcefully state that climate change is real , that human activities are a primary contributor to it and that there is a scientific consensus on the issue .
his acceptance of the scientific consensus on climate change has drawn criticism from fox news viewers and conservatives .
on may *num* , *num* , a day when other news organizations were extensively covering donald trump's revelation of classified information to russia , fox news ran a lead story about a private investigator's uncorroborated claims about the murder of seth rich , a dnc staffer .
the private investigator said he had uncovered evidence that rich was in contact with wikileaks and law enforcement were covering it up .
the killing of rich has given rise to conspiracy theories in rightwing circles that hillary clinton and the democratic party had seth rich killed allegedly because he was the source of the dnc leaks .
u .
s .
intelligence agencies determined russia was the source of the leaks .
in reporting the investigator's claims , the fox news report reignited right-wing conspiracy theories about the killing .
the fox news story fell apart within hours .
other news organizations quickly revealed the investigator was a donald trump supporter and had according to " nbc news " " developed a reputation for making outlandish claims , such as one appearance on fox news in *num* in which he warned that underground networks of pink pistol-toting lesbian gangs were raping young women .
" the family of seth rich , the washington , d .
c .
police department , the washington , d .
c .
mayor's office , the fbi , and law enforcement sources familiar with the case , rebuked the investigator's claims .
the family said , " we are a family who is committed to facts , not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding seth's murderers .
" the spokesperson for the family criticized fox news for its reporting , alleging the outlet was motivated by a desire to deflect attention from the trump-russia story : " i think there's a very special place in hell for people that would use the memory of a murder victim in order to pursue a political agenda .
" the family has called for retractions and apologies from fox news for the inaccurate reporting .
over the course of the day , fox news altered the contents of the story and the headline , but did not issue corrections .
when cnn contacted the private investigator later that day , the investigator said he had no evidence that rich had contacted wikileaks .
the investigator claimed he only learned about the possible existence of the evidence from a fox news reporter .
fox news did not respond to inquiries by cnn , and the washington post .
fox news later on *num* may , seven days after the story was published , retracted its original report , saying the original report did not meet its standards .
nicole hemmer , assistant professor at the miller center of public affairs , wrote that the promotion of the conspiracy theory demonstrated how fox news was " remaking itself in the image of fringe media in the age of trump , blurring the lines between real and fake news .
" max boot of the council on foreign relations said while intent behind fox news , as a counterweight to the liberal media was laudable , the culmination of those efforts have been to create an alternative news source that promotes hoaxes and myths , of which the promotion of the seth rich conspiracy is an example .
fox news was also criticized by conservative outlets , such as the " weekly standard " , " national review " , and conservative columnists , such as jennifer rubin , michael gerson , and john podhoretz .
various fox news hosts and contributors defended trump's remarks that " many sides " were to blame for violence at a gathering of hundreds of white nationalists in charlottesville , virginia .
some criticized trump .
in a press conference on august *num* , trump used the term " alt-left " to describe counterprotesters at the white supremacist rally , a term which had been used in fox news ' coverage of the white supremacist rally .
several of trump's comments at the press conference mirrored those appearing earlier on fox news .
according to dylan byers of cnn , fox news ' coverage on the day of the press conference " was heavy with " whataboutism " .
the average fox viewer was likely left with the impression that the media's criticism of trump and leftist protestors ' toppling of some confederate statues were far greater threats to america than white supremacism or the president's apparent defense of bigotry .
" byers wrote , " it showed that if fox news has a line when it comes to trump's presidency , it was not crossed on tuesday .
" during glenn beck's tenure at fox news , he became one of the most high-profile proponents of conspiracy theories about george soros , a jewish hungarian-american businessman and philanthropist known for his donations to american liberal political causes .
beck regularly described soros as a " puppet-master " and used common anti-semitic tropes to refer to soros and his activities .
in a *num* three-part series , beck depicted george soros as a cartoonish villain trying to " form a shadow government , using humanitarian aid as a cover , " and that soros wanted a one-world government .
beck promoted the false and anti-semitic conspiracy theory that soros was a nazi collaborator as a 14-year old in nazi-occupied hungary .
beck also characterized soros's mother as a " wildly anti-semitic " nazi collaborator .
according to " the washington post " , " beck's series was largely considered obscene and delusional , if not outright anti-semitic " , but beck's conspiracy theory became popular on the rightwing of american politics .
amid criticism of beck's false smears , fox news defended beck , stating " information regarding mr .
soros's experiences growing up were taken directly from his writings and from interviews given by him to the media , and no negative opinion was offered as to his actions as a child .
" roger ailes , then-head of fox news , dismissed criticism levied at beck by hundreds of rabbis , saying that they were " left-wing rabbis who basically don't think that anybody can ever use the word , holocaust , on the air .
" the network has been accused of permitting sexual harassment and racial discrimination by on-air hosts , executives , and employees , paying out millions of dollars in legal settlements .
prominent fox news figures such as roger ailes , bill o'reilly and eric bolling were eventually fired after a multitude of women accused them of sexual harassment .
at least four lawsuits alleged fox news co-president bill shine ignored , enabled or concealed roger ailes ' alleged sexual harassment .
fox news ceo rupert murdoch has dismissed the high-profile sexual misconduct allegations as " largely political " and speculated they were made " because we are conservative " .
bill o'reilly and fox news settled six agreements , totaling $45 million , with women who accused o'reilly of sexual harassment .
in january *num* , shortly after bill o'reilly settled a sexual harassment lawsuit for $32 million ( " an extraordinarily large amount for such cases " ) , fox news renewed bill o'reilly's contract .
fox news's parent company , *ord* century fox , said it was aware of the lawsuit .
the contract between o'reilly and fox news read he could not be fired from the network unless sexual harassment allegations were proved in court .
fox news's extensive coverage of the harvey weinstein scandal in october *num* was seen by some as hypocritical .
fox news dedicated at least *num* hours of coverage to the weinstein scandal , yet only dedicated *num* minutes to bill o'reilly , who just like weinstein had been accused of sexual harassment by a multitude of women .
indira lakshmana , an expert in journalism ethics at the poynter institute , said " to devote hours of airtime to crowing about weinstein's well-deserved downfall because of his liberal politics , while ignoring the massive , decades-long pattern of harassment by powerful men at fox , is both hypocritical and sad " .
a few weeks later , when a number of women under the age of *num* , including a 14-year old , accused alabama senate candidate roy moore of making sexual advances , hannity dismissed the sexual misconduct allegations and dedicated coverage on his tv show to casting doubt on the accusers .
other prime-time fox news hosts tucker carlson and laura ingraham questioned the " washington post"'s reporting or opted to bring up sexual misconduct allegations regarding show business elites such as harvey weinstein and louis c .
k .
fox news figures jeanine pirro and gregg jarrett questioned both the validity of the " washington post"'s reporting and that of the women .
in december *num* , a few days before the alabama senate election , fox news , along with the conspiracy websites breitbart and gateway pundit , ran an inaccurate headline which claimed one of roy moore's accusers admitted to forging an inscription by roy moore in her yearbook ; fox news later added a correction to the story .
a number of fox news hosts have welcomed bill o'reilly to their shows and paid tributes to roger ailes after his death .
in may *num* , hannity called ailes " a second father " and said to ailes's " enemies " that he was " preparing to kick your a** in the next life " .
ailes had the year before been fired from fox news after a number of women alleged he sexually harassed them .
in september *num* , several months after bill o'reilly was fired from fox news in the wake of a number of women alleging he sexually harassed them , hannity hosted o'reilly on his show .
some fox news employees criticized the decision .
according to " cnn " , during the interview , hannity found kinship with o'reilly as he appeared " to feel that he and o'reilly have both become victims of liberals looking to silence them .
" earlier , hannity had dedicated extensive coverage to the weinstein scandal .
in september *num* , the obama administration engaged in a verbal conflict with fox news channel .
on september *num* , president barack obama appeared on all major news programs except fox news , a snub partially in response to remarks about him by commentators glenn beck and sean hannity , and fox coverage of obama's health-care proposal .
in late september *num* , obama senior advisor david axelrod and roger ailes met in secret to attempt to smooth out tensions between the two camps .
two weeks later , chief of staff rahm emanuel referred to fnc as " not a news network " and communications director anita dunn said " fox news often operates as either the research arm or the communications arm of the republican party " .
obama observed , " if media is operating basically as a talk radio format , then that's one thing , and if it's operating as a news outlet , then that's another " .
white house chief of staff rahm emanuel said it was important " to not have the cnns and the others in the world basically be led in following fox " .
within days , it was reported that fox had been excluded from an interview with administration official ken feinberg , with bureau chiefs from the white house press pool ( abc , cbs , nbc , and cnn ) coming to fox's defense .
a bureau chief said , " if any member had been excluded it would have been the same thing , it has nothing to do with fox or the white house or the substance of the issues " .
shortly after the story broke , the white house admitted to a low-level mistake , saying fox had not made a specific request to interview feinberg .
fox white house correspondent major garrett said he had not made a specific request , but had a " standing request from me as senior white house correspondent on fox to interview any newsmaker at the treasury at any given time news is being made " .
on november *num* , *num* , the " los angeles times " reported an unnamed democratic consultant was warned by the white house not to appear on fox news again .
according to the article , anita dunn claimed in an e-mail to have checked with colleagues who " deal with tv issues " who denied telling anyone to avoid fox .
patrick caddell , a fox news contributor and former pollster for president jimmy carter , said he had spoken with other democratic consultants who had received similar warnings from the white house .
on october *num* , *num* , fox news host anna kooiman cited on the air a fake story from the " national report " parody site , which claimed obama had offered to keep the international museum of muslim cultures open with cash from his own pocket .
fox news attracted controversy in april *num* when it was revealed primetime host sean hannity had defended michael cohen on air without disclosing that cohen was hannity's lawyer .
on april *num* , *num* , federal agents from the u .
s .
attorney's office served a search warrant on the office and residence of michael cohen , trump's personal attorney .
on the air , hannity defended cohen and criticized the federal action , calling it " highly questionable " and " an unprecedented abuse of power " .
on april *num* , *num* in a court hearing , cohen's lawyers told the judge that cohen had ten clients in 2017–2018 but did " traditional legal tasks " for only three : trump , elliott broidy , and a " prominent person " who did not wish to be named for fear of being " embarrassed " .
the federal judge ordered the revelation of the third client , whom cohen's lawyers named as hannity .
hannity was not sanctioned by fox news for this breach of journalistic ethics , with fox news releasing a statement that the channel was unaware of hannity's relationship to cohen and that it had " spoken to sean and he continues to have our full support .
" media ethics experts said that hannity's failure to disclose was a major breach of journalistic ethics and that the network should have suspended or fired him for it .
the fox news channel feed is available internationally via a number of providers , while " fox extra " segments provide alternate programming .
initially , u .
s .
advertisements were replaced on fnc with viewer e-mail and profiles of fnc anchors set to music .
in *num* , these were replaced with international weather forecasts .
in *num* , the weather forecasts were replaced with " fox extra " ( originally " fox news extra " , prior to the international launch of fox business ) segments , narrated reports from fox on a variety of topics .
these reports generally concern lighter issues unrelated to current news events , and the segments are repeated .
fnc also shows international weather forecasts when " fox extra " segments run short .
in the united kingdom , after a period when local commercials were inserted into breaks , " fox extra " now fills most breaks .
in australia , fnc is broadcast on the dominant pay television provider foxtel , which is *num* % owned by news corp australia , the australian arm of news corp and the sister company of *ord* century fox which owns fnc .
local cable news channel sky news australia is wholly owned by news corp australia and is therefore fnc's de facto sister channel , although has formal partnerships with fnc competitor cnn as well as both abc news and cbs news .
since *num* , fnc has been broadcast to brazil ; however , commercials are replaced with " fox extra " .
it is available in packages of vivo tv .
fox had initially planned to launch a joint venture with canwest's global television network , tentatively named fox news canada , which would have featured a mixture of u .
s .

the company said the decision was unrelated to *ord* century fox's proposed acquisition of the remainder of sky plc , which is currently undergoing a review by regulators .
the potential co-ownership had prompted concerns from critics of the deal , who felt sky news could undergo a shift to an opinionated format with a right-wing viewpoint , similar to fox news ; the channel has violated the ofcom codes a number of times , including broadcasting analysis of the brexit vote while polls were still open ( a violation of british election laws ; the channel was blocked while polls were open during the *num* general election to comply with these rules ) , and various violations of a requirement for all news programming to show due impartiality .

chuck jones charles martin jones ( september *num* , *num* – february *num* , *num* ) was an american animator , filmmaker , cartoonist , author , artist , and screenwriter , best known for his work with warner bros .
cartoons on the " looney tunes " and " merrie melodies " shorts .
he wrote , produced , and / or directed many classic animated cartoon shorts starring bugs bunny , daffy duck , wile e .
coyote and the road runner , pepé le pew , porky pig , michigan j .
frog , the three bears , and a slew of other warner characters .
after his career at warner bros .
ended in *num* , jones started sib tower *num* productions , and began producing cartoons for metro-goldwyn-mayer , including a new series of " tom and jerry " shorts and the television adaptation of dr .
seuss ' " how the grinch stole christmas ! " .
he later started his own studio , chuck jones enterprises , which created several one-shot specials , and periodically worked on " looney tunes " related works .
jones was nominated for an oscar eight times and won three times , receiving awards for the cartoons " for scent-imental reasons " , " so much for so little " , and " the dot and the line " .
he received an honorary academy award in *num* for his work in the animation industry .
film historian leonard maltin has praised jones ' work at warner bros .
, mgm and chuck jones enterprises .
he also said that the " feud " that there may have been between jones and colleague bob clampett was mainly because they were so different from each other .
in jerry beck's " the *num* greatest cartoons " , ten of the entries were directed by jones , with four out of the five top cartoons ( including first place ) being jones shorts .
jones was born on september *num* , *num* , in spokane , washington , the son of mabel mcquiddy ( martin ) and charles adams jones .
he later moved with his parents and three siblings to the los angeles , california area .
in his autobiography , " chuck amuck " , jones credits his artistic bent to circumstances surrounding his father , who was an unsuccessful businessman in california in the 1920s .
his father , jones recounts , would start every new business venture by purchasing new stationery and new pencils with the company name on them .
when the business failed , his father would quietly turn the huge stacks of useless stationery and pencils over to his children , requiring them to use up all the material as fast as possible .
armed with an endless supply of high-quality paper and pencils , the children drew constantly .
later , in one art school class , the professor gravely informed the students that they each had *num* , *num* bad drawings in them that they must first get past before they could possibly draw anything worthwhile .
jones recounted years later that this pronouncement came as a great relief to him , as he was well past the *num* , *num* mark , having used up all that stationery .
jones and several of his siblings went on to artistic careers .
during his artistic education , he worked part-time as a janitor .
after graduating from chouinard art institute , jones got a phone call from a friend named fred kopietz , who had been hired by the ub iwerks studio and offered him a job .
he worked his way up in the animation industry , starting as a cel washer ; " then i moved up to become a painter in black and white , some color .
then i went on to take animator's drawings and traced them onto the celluloid .
then i became what they call an in-betweener , which is the guy that does the drawing between the drawings the animator makes " .
while at iwerks , he met a cel painter named dorothy webster , who later became his first wife .
jones joined leon schlesinger productions , the independent studio that produced " looney tunes " and " merrie melodies " for warner bros .
, in *num* as an assistant animator .
in *num* , he was promoted to animator , and assigned to work with new schlesinger director tex avery .
there was no room for the new avery unit in schlesinger's small studio , so avery , jones , and fellow animators bob clampett , virgil ross , and sid sutherland were moved into a small adjacent building they dubbed " termite terrace " .
when clampett was promoted to director in *num* , jones was assigned to his unit ; the clampett unit was briefly assigned to work with jones ' old employer , ub iwerks when iwerks subcontracted four cartoons to schlesinger in *num* .
jones became a director ( or " supervisor " , the original title for an animation director in the studio ) himself in *num* when frank tashlin left the studio .
the following year jones created his first major character , sniffles , a cute disney-style mouse , who went on to star in twelve warner bros .
cartoons .
he was actively involved in efforts to unionize the staff of leon schlesinger studios .
he was responsible for recruiting animators , layout men , and background people .
almost all animators joined , in reaction to salary cuts imposed by leon schlesinger .
the metro-goldwyn-mayer cartoon studio had already signed a union contract , encouraging their counterparts under schlesinger .
in a meeting with his staff , schlesinger talked for a few minutes , then turned over the meeting to his attorney .
his insulting manner had a unifying effect on the staff .
jones gave a pep talk at the union headquarters .
as negotiations broke down , the staff decided to go on strike .
schlesinger locked them out of the studio for a few days , before agreeing to sign the contract .
a labor management committee was formed and jones served as a moderator .
because of his role as a supervisor in the studio , he could not himself join the union .
jones created many of his lesser-known characters during this period , including charlie dog , hubie and bertie , and the three bears .
during world war ii , jones worked closely with theodor geisel , better known as dr .
seuss , to create the " private snafu " series of army educational cartoons ( the character was created by director frank capra ) .
jones later collaborated with seuss on animated adaptations of seuss ' books , including " how the grinch stole christmas ! " in *num* .
jones directed such shorts as " the weakly reporter " , a *num* short that related to shortages and rationing on the home front .
during the same year , he directed " hell-bent for election " , a campaign film for franklin d .
roosevelt .
jones created characters through the late 1940s and the 1950s , which include claude cat , marc antony and pussyfoot , charlie dog , michigan j .
frog , and his four most popular creations , marvin the martian , pepé le pew , wile e .
coyote and the road runner .

other staff at unit a that jones collaborated with include layout artist , background designer , co-director maurice noble ; animator and co-director abe levitow ; and animators ken harris and ben washam .
jones remained at warner bros .
throughout the 1950s , except for a brief period in *num* when warner closed the animation studio .
during this interim , jones found employment at walt disney productions , where he teamed with ward kimball for a four-month period of uncredited work on " sleeping beauty " ( *num* ) .
upon the reopening of the warner animation department , jones was rehired and reunited with most of his unit .
in the early 1960s , jones and his wife dorothy wrote the screenplay for the animated feature " gay purr-ee " .
the finished film would feature the voices of judy garland , robert goulet and red buttons as cats in paris , france .
the feature was produced by upa and directed by his former warner bros .
collaborator , abe levitow .
jones moonlighted to work on the film since he had an exclusive contract with warner bros .
upa completed the film and made it available for distribution in *num* ; it was picked up by warner bros .
when warner bros .
discovered that jones had violated his exclusive contract with them , they terminated him .
jones ' former animation unit was laid off after completing the final cartoon in their pipeline , " the iceman ducketh " , and the rest of the warner bros .
cartoons studio was closed in early *num* .
with business partner les goldman , jones started an independent animation studio , sib tower *num* productions , and brought on most of his unit from warner bros .
, including maurice noble and michael maltese .
in *num* , metro-goldwyn-mayer contracted with sib tower *num* to have jones and his staff produce new " tom and jerry " cartoons as well as a television adaptation of all " tom and jerry " theatricals produced to that date .
this included major editing , including writing out the african-american maid , mammy two-shoes , and replacing her with one of irish descent voiced by june foray .
in *num* , sib tower *num* was absorbed by mgm and was renamed mgm animation / visual arts .
his animated short film , " the dot and the line : a romance in lower mathematics " , won the *num* academy award for best animated short film .
jones directed the classic animated short " the bear that wasn't " .
as the " tom and jerry " series wound down ( it was discontinued in *num* ) , jones produced more for television .
in *num* , he produced and directed the tv special " how the grinch stole christmas ! " , featuring the voice and facial models based on the readings by boris karloff .
jones continued to work on other tv specials such as " horton hears a who ! " ( *num* ) , but his main focus during this time was producing the feature film " the phantom tollbooth " , which did lukewarm business when mgm released it in *num* .
jones co-directed 1969's " the pogo special birthday special " , based on the walt kelly comic strip , and voiced the characters of porky pine and bun rab .
it was at this point that he decided to start st incorporated .
mgm closed the animation division in *num* , and jones once again started his own studio , chuck jones enterprises .
he produced a saturday morning children's tv series for the american broadcasting company called " the curiosity shop " in *num* .
in *num* , he produced an animated version of the george selden book " the cricket in times square " and would go on to produce two sequels .
three of his works during this period were animated tv adaptations of short stories from rudyard kipling's " mowgli's brothers " , " the white seal " and " rikki-tikki-tavi " .
during this period , jones began to experiment with more realistically designed characters , most of which having larger eyes , leaner bodies , and altered proportions , such as those of the looney tunes characters .
jones resumed working with warner bros .
in *num* with the animated tv adaptation of " the carnival of the animals " with bugs bunny and daffy duck .
jones also produced the *num* film " the bugs bunny / road runner movie " which was a compilation of jones ' best theatrical shorts ; jones produced new road runner shorts for " the electric company " series and " bugs bunny's looney christmas tales " ( *num* ) , and even newer shorts were made for " bugs bunny's bustin ' out all over " ( *num* ) .

on december *num* , *num* , shortly after the release of " bugs bunny superstar " , which prominently featured bob clampett , jones wrote a letter to tex avery , accusing clampett of taking credit for ideas that were not his , and for characters created by other directors ( notably jones's sniffles and friz freleng's yosemite sam ) .
their correspondence was never published in the media .
it was forwarded to michael barrier , who conducted the interview with clampett and was distributed by jones to multiple people concerned with animation over the years .
robert mckimson claimed in an interview that many animators but mostly clampett contributed to the crazy personality of bugs , while others like chuck jones concentrated more on the more calmed-down gags .
as far as plagiarism is concerned , mckimson claimed the animators would always be looking at each other's sheets to see if they could borrow some punchlines and cracks .
through the 1980s and 1990s , jones was painting cartoon and parody art , sold through animation galleries by his daughter's company , linda jones enterprises .
jones was the creative consultant and character designer for two raggedy ann animated specials and the first " alvin and the chipmunks " christmas special " a chipmunk christmas " .
he made a cameo appearance in the *num* film " gremlins " and directed the bugs bunny / daffy duck animated sequences that bookend its sequel " " ( *num* ) .
jones directed animated sequences for various features such as a lengthy sequence in the *num* film " stay tuned " and a shorter one seen at the start of the *num* film " mrs .
doubtfire " .
also during the 1980s and 1990s jones served on the advisory board of the national student film institute .
jones ' final looney tunes cartoon was " from hare to eternity " in *num* , which starred bugs bunny and yosemite sam , with greg burson voicing bugs .
the cartoon was dedicated to friz freleng , who had died in *num* .
jones ' final animation project was a series of *num* shorts starring a timber wolf character he had designed in the 1960s named thomas timber wolf .
the series was released online by warner bros .
in *num* .
from *num* until *num* , cartoon network aired " the chuck jones show " which features shorts directed by him .
the show won the annie award for outstanding achievement in an animated special project .
jones died of heart failure on february *num* , *num* .
he was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea .
after his death , the looney tunes cartoon " daffy duck for president " , based on the book that jones had written and using jones ' style for the characters , originally scheduled to be released in *num* , was released in *num* as part of disc three of the " " dvd set .
jones was a historical authority as well as a major contributor to the development of animation throughout the *ord* century .
he received an honorary degree from oglethorpe university in *num* .
for his contribution to the motion picture industry , jones has a star on the hollywood walk of fame at *num* hollywood blvd .
jones , whose work had been nominated eight times over his career for an oscar ( winning the award three times : " for scent-imental reasons " , " so much for so little " , and " the dot and the line " ) , received an honorary academy award in *num* by the board of governors of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences , for " the creation of classic cartoons and cartoon characters whose animated lives have brought joy to our real ones for more than half a century .
" at that year's awards show , robin williams , a self-confessed " jones-aholic , " presented the honorary award to jones , calling him " the orson welles of cartoons .
" , and the audience gave jones a standing ovation as he walked onto the stage .
for himself , a flattered jones wryly remarked in his acceptance speech , " well , what can i say in the face of such humiliating evidence ? i stand guilty before the world of directing over three hundred cartoons in the last fifty or sixty years .
hopefully , this means you've forgiven me .
" he received the lifetime achievement award at the world festival of animated film – animafest zagreb in *num* .
jones ' life and legacy were celebrated january *num* , *num* , with the official grand opening of " the chuck jones experience " at circus circus las vegas .
many of jones ' family welcomed celebrities , animation aficionados and visitors to the new attraction when they opened the attraction in an appropriate and unconventional way .
among those in attendance were jones ' widow , marian jones ; daughter linda clough ; and grandchildren craig , todd and valerie kausen .
calculator an electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations , ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics .
the first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s .
pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s , especially after the intel *num* , the first microprocessor , was developed by intel for the japanese calculator company busicom .
they later became used commonly within the petroleum industry ( oil and gas ) .
modern electronic calculators vary from cheap , give-away , credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers .
they became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost .
by the end of that decade , prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools .
computer operating systems as far back as early unix have included interactive calculator programs such as dc and hoc , and calculator functions are included in almost all personal digital assistant ( pda ) type devices , the exceptions being a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices .
in addition to general purpose calculators , there are those designed for specific markets .
for example , there are scientific calculators which include trigonometric and statistical calculations .
some calculators even have the ability to do computer algebra .
graphing calculators can be used to graph functions defined on the real line , or higher-dimensional euclidean space .
, basic calculators cost little , but scientific and graphing models tend to cost more .
in *num* , calculators still represented an estimated *num* % of the world's general-purpose hardware capacity to compute information .
by *num* , this had diminished to less than *num* .
*num* % .
electronic calculators contain a keyboard with buttons for digits and arithmetical operations ; some even contain " *num* " and " *num* " buttons to make larger or smaller numbers easier to enter .
most basic calculators assign only one digit or operation on each button ; however , in more specific calculators , a button can perform multi-function working with key combinations .
calculators usually have liquid-crystal displays ( lcd ) as output in place of historical light-emitting diode ( led ) displays and vacuum fluorescent displays ( vfd ) ; details are provided in the section " technical improvements " .
large-sized figures are often used to improve readability ; while using decimal separator ( usually a point rather than a comma ) instead of or in addition to vulgar fractions .
various symbols for function commands may also be shown on the display .
fractions such as are displayed as decimal approximations , for example rounded to .
also , some fractions ( such as , which is ; to *num* significant figures ) can be difficult to recognize in decimal form ; as a result , many scientific calculators are able to work in vulgar fractions or mixed numbers .
calculators also have the ability to store numbers into computer memory .
basic calculators usually store only one number at a time ; more specific types are able to store many numbers represented in variables .
the variables can also be used for constructing formulas .
some models have the ability to extend memory capacity to store more numbers ; the extended memory address is termed an array index .
power sources of calculators are : batteries , solar cells or mains electricity ( for old models ) , turning on with a switch or button .
some models even have no turn-off button but they provide some way to put off ( for example , leaving no operation for a moment , covering solar cell exposure , or closing their lid ) .
crank-powered calculators were also common in the early computer era .
the following keys are common to most pocket calculators .
while the arrangement of the digits is standard , the positions of other keys vary from model to model ; the illustration is an example .
in general , a basic electronic calculator consists of the following components : clock rate of a processor chip refers to the frequency at which the central processing unit ( cpu ) is running .
it is used as an indicator of the processor's speed , and is measured in " clock cycles per second " or the si unit hertz ( hz ) .
for basic calculators , the speed can vary from a few hundred hertz to the kilohertz range .
a basic explanation as to how calculations are performed in a simple four-function calculator : to perform the calculation , one presses keys in the following sequence on most calculators : .
other functions are usually performed using repeated additions or subtractions .
most pocket calculators do all their calculations in bcd rather than a floating-point representation .
bcd is common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed , especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic , and not containing a microprocessor .
by employing bcd , the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub-circuit .
this matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware—a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical seven-segment displays to build a metering circuit , for example .
if the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as pure binary , interfacing to such a display would require complex circuitry .
therefore , in cases where the calculations are relatively simple , working throughout with bcd can lead to a simpler overall system than converting to and from binary .
the same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor .
often , smaller code results when representing numbers internally in bcd format , since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors .
for these applications , some small processors feature bcd arithmetic modes , which assist when writing routines that manipulate bcd quantities .
where calculators have added functions ( such as square root , or trigonometric functions ) , software algorithms are required to produce high precision results .
sometimes significant design effort is needed to fit all the desired functions in the limited memory space available in the calculator chip , with acceptable calculation time .
the fundamental difference between a calculator and computer is that a computer can be programmed in a way that allows the program to take different branches according to intermediate results , while calculators are pre-designed with specific functions ( such as addition , multiplication , and logarithms ) built in .
the distinction is not clear-cut : some devices classed as programmable calculators have programming functions , sometimes with support for programming languages ( such as rpl or ti-basic ) .
for instance , instead of a hardware multiplier , a calculator might implement floating point mathematics with code in read-only memory ( rom ) , and compute trigonometric functions with the cordic algorithm because cordic does not require much multiplication .
bit serial logic designs are more common in calculators whereas bit parallel designs dominate general-purpose computers , because a bit serial design minimizes chip complexity , but takes many more clock cycles .
this distinction blurs with high-end calculators , which use processor chips associated with computer and embedded systems design , more so the z80 , mc68000 , and arm architectures , and some custom designs specialized for the calculator market .
the first known tools used to aid arithmetic calculations were : bones ( used to tally items ) , pebbles , and counting boards , and the abacus , known to have been used by sumerians and egyptians before *num* bc .
except for the antikythera mechanism ( an " out of the time " astronomical device ) , development of computing tools arrived near the start of the *ord* century : the geometric-military compass ( by galileo ) , logarithms and napier bones ( by napier ) , and the slide rule ( by edmund gunter ) .
in *num* , the renaissance saw the invention of the mechanical calculator ( by wilhelm schickard and several decades later blaise pascal ) , a device that was at times somewhat over-promoted as being able to perform all four arithmetic operations with minimal human intervention .
pascal's calculator could add and subtract two numbers directly and thus , if the tedium could be borne , multiply and divide by repetition .
schickard's machine , constructed several decades earlier , used a clever set of mechanised multiplication tables to ease the process of multiplication and division with the adding machine as a means of completing this operation .
( because they were different inventions with different aims a debate about whether pascal or schickard should be credited as the " inventor " of the adding machine ( or calculating machine ) is probably pointless .
) schickard and pascal were followed by gottfried leibniz who spent forty years designing a four-operation mechanical calculator , the stepped reckoner , inventing in the process his leibniz wheel , but who couldn't design a fully operational machine .
there were also five unsuccessful attempts to design a calculating clock in the *ord* century .
the *ord* century saw the arrival of some notable improvements , first by poleni with the first fully functional calculating clock and four-operation machine , but these machines were almost always " one of the kind " .
luigi torchi invented the first direct multiplication machine in *num* : this was also the second key-driven machine in the world , following that of james white ( *num* ) .
it was not until the *ord* century and the industrial revolution that real developments began to occur .
although machines capable of performing all four arithmetic functions existed prior to the *ord* century , the refinement of manufacturing and fabrication processes during the eve of the industrial revolution made large scale production of more compact and modern units possible .
the arithmometer , invented in *num* as a four-operation mechanical calculator , was released to production in *num* as an adding machine and became the first commercially successful unit ; forty years later , by *num* , about *num* , *num* arithmometers had been sold plus a few hundreds more from two arithmometer clone makers ( burkhardt , germany , *num* and layton , uk , *num* ) and felt and tarrant , the only other competitor in true commercial production , had sold *num* comptometers .
it wasn't until *num* that the familiar push-button user interface was developed , with the introduction of the dalton adding machine , developed by james l .
dalton in the united states .
in *num* , edith clarke invented the " clarke calculator " , a simple graph-based calculator for solving line equations involving hyperbolic functions .
this allowed electrical engineers to simplify calculations for inductance and capacitance in power transmission lines .
the curta calculator was developed in *num* and , although costly , became popular for its portability .
this purely mechanical hand-held device could do addition , subtraction , multiplication and division .
by the early 1970s electronic pocket calculators ended manufacture of mechanical calculators , although the curta remains a popular collectable item .
the first mainframe computers , using firstly vacuum tubes and later transistors in the logic circuits , appeared in the 1940s and 1950s .
this technology was to provide a stepping stone to the development of electronic calculators .
the casio computer company , in japan , released the model " 14-a " calculator in *num* , which was the world's first all-electric ( relatively ) compact calculator .
it did not use electronic logic but was based on relay technology , and was built into a desk .
in october *num* , the world's first " all-electronic desktop " calculator , the british bell punch / sumlock comptometer anita ( a new inspiration to arithmetic / accounting ) was announced .
this machine used vacuum tubes , cold-cathode tubes and dekatrons in its circuits , with *num* cold-cathode " nixie " tubes for its display .
two models were displayed , the mk vii for continental europe and the mk viii for britain and the rest of the world , both for delivery from early *num* .
the mk vii was a slightly earlier design with a more complicated mode of multiplication , and was soon dropped in favour of the simpler mark viii .
the anita had a full keyboard , similar to mechanical comptometers of the time , a feature that was unique to it and the later sharp cs-10a among electronic calculators .
the anita weighed roughly due to its large tube system .
bell punch had been producing key-driven mechanical calculators of the comptometer type under the names " plus " and " sumlock " , and had realised in the mid-1950s that the future of calculators lay in electronics .
they employed the young graduate norbert kitz , who had worked on the early british pilot ace computer project , to lead the development .
the anita sold well since it was the only electronic desktop calculator available , and was silent and quick .
the tube technology of the anita was superseded in june *num* by the u .
s .
manufactured friden ec-130 , which had an all-transistor design , a stack of four 13-digit numbers displayed on a cathode ray tube ( crt ) , and introduced reverse polish notation ( rpn ) to the calculator market for a price of $2200 , which was about three times the cost of an electromechanical calculator of the time .
like bell punch , friden was a manufacturer of mechanical calculators that had decided that the future lay in electronics .
in *num* more all-transistor electronic calculators were introduced : sharp introduced the cs-10a , which weighed and cost *num* , *num* yen ( $ ) , and industria macchine elettroniche of italy introduced the ime *num* , to which several extra keyboard and display units could be connected so that several people could make use of it ( but apparently not at the same time ) .
there followed a series of electronic calculator models from these and other manufacturers , including canon , mathatronics , olivetti , scm ( smith-corona-marchant ) , sony , toshiba , and wang .
the early calculators used hundreds of germanium transistors , which were cheaper than silicon transistors , on multiple circuit boards .
display types used were crt , cold-cathode nixie tubes , and filament lamps .
memory technology was usually based on the delay line memory or the magnetic core memory , though the toshiba " toscal " bc-1411 appears to have used an early form of dynamic ram built from discrete components .
already there was a desire for smaller and less power-hungry machines .
the olivetti programma *num* was introduced in late *num* ; it was a stored program machine which could read and write magnetic cards and displayed results on its built-in printer .
memory , implemented by an acoustic delay line , could be partitioned between program steps , constants , and data registers .
programming allowed conditional testing and programs could also be overlaid by reading from magnetic cards .
it is regarded as the first personal computer produced by a company ( that is , a desktop electronic calculating machine programmable by non-specialists for personal use ) .
the olivetti programma *num* won many industrial design awards .
another calculator introduced in *num* was bulgaria's elka *num* , developed by the central institute for calculation technologies and built at the elektronika factory in sofia .
the name derives from " elektronen kalkulator " , and it weighed around .
it is the first calculator in the world which includes the square root function .
later that same year were released the elka *num* ( with a luminescent display ) and the elka *num* , with an in-built printer .
several other models were developed until the first pocket model , the elka *num* , was released in *num* .
the writing on it was in roman script , and it was exported to western countries .
the " monroe epic " programmable calculator came on the market in *num* .
a large , printing , desk-top unit , with an attached floor-standing logic tower , it could be programmed to perform many computer-like functions .
however , the only " branch " instruction was an implied unconditional branch ( goto ) at the end of the operation stack , returning the program to its starting instruction .
thus , it was not possible to include any conditional branch ( if-then-else ) logic .
during this era , the absence of the conditional branch was sometimes used to distinguish a programmable calculator from a computer .
the first handheld calculator was a prototype called " cal tech " , whose development was led by jack kilby at texas instruments in *num* .
it could add , multiply , subtract , and divide , and its output device was a paper tape .
the electronic calculators of the mid-1960s were large and heavy desktop machines due to their use of hundreds of transistors on several circuit boards with a large power consumption that required an ac power supply .
there were great efforts to put the logic required for a calculator into fewer and fewer integrated circuits ( chips ) and calculator electronics was one of the leading edges of semiconductor development .
u .
s .
semiconductor manufacturers led the world in large scale integration ( lsi ) semiconductor development , squeezing more and more functions into individual integrated circuits .
this led to alliances between japanese calculator manufacturers and u .
s .
semiconductor companies : canon inc .
with texas instruments , hayakawa electric ( later renamed sharp corporation ) with north-american rockwell microelectronics ( later renamed rockwell international ) , busicom with mostek and intel , and general instrument with sanyo .
by *num* , a calculator could be made using just a few chips of low power consumption , allowing portable models powered from rechargeable batteries .
the first portable calculators appeared in japan in *num* , and were soon marketed around the world .
these included the sanyo icc-0081 " mini calculator " , the canon pocketronic , and the sharp qt-8b " micro compet " .
the canon pocketronic was a development of the " cal-tech " project which had been started at texas instruments in *num* as a research project to produce a portable calculator .
the pocketronic has no traditional display ; numerical output is on thermal paper tape .
as a result of the " cal-tech " project , texas instruments was granted master patents on portable calculators .
sharp put in great efforts in size and power reduction and introduced in january *num* the sharp el-8 , also marketed as the facit *num* , which was close to being a pocket calculator .
it weighed *num* .
*num* pounds ( *num* grams ) , had a vacuum fluorescent display , rechargeable nicad batteries , and initially sold for us $395 .
however , the efforts in integrated circuit development culminated in the introduction in early *num* of the first " calculator on a chip " , the mk6010 by mostek , followed by texas instruments later in the year .
although these early hand-held calculators were very costly , these advances in electronics , together with developments in display technology ( such as the vacuum fluorescent display , led , and lcd ) , led within a few years to the cheap pocket calculator available to all .
in *num* pico electronics .
and general instrument also introduced their first collaboration in ics , a full single chip calculator ic for the monroe royal digital iii calculator .
pico was a spinout by five gi design engineers whose vision was to create single chip calculator ics .
pico and gi went on to have significant success in the burgeoning handheld calculator market .
the first truly pocket-sized electronic calculator was the busicom le-120a " handy " , which was marketed early in *num* .
made in japan , this was also the first calculator to use an led display , the first hand-held calculator to use a single integrated circuit ( then proclaimed as a " calculator on a chip " ) , the mostek mk6010 , and the first electronic calculator to run off replaceable batteries .
using four aa-size cells the le-120a measures .
the first european-made pocket-sized calculator , db *num* is made in may *num* by digitron in buje , croatia ( former yugoslavia ) with four functions and an eight-digit display and special characters for a negative number and a warning that the calculation has too many digits to display .
the first american-made pocket-sized calculator , the bowmar 901b ( popularly termed " the bowmar brain " ) , measuring , came out in the autumn of *num* , with four functions and an eight-digit red led display , for $240 , while in august *num* the four-function sinclair executive became the first slimline pocket calculator measuring and weighing .
it retailed for around £79 ( $ ) .
by the end of the decade , similar calculators were priced less than £5 ( $ ) .
the first soviet union made pocket-sized calculator , the " elektronika b3-04 " was developed by the end of *num* and sold at the start of *num* .
one of the first low-cost calculators was the sinclair cambridge , launched in august *num* .
it retailed for £29 .
*num* ( $ ) , or £5 ( $ ) less in kit form .
the sinclair calculators were successful because they were far cheaper than the competition ; however , their design led to slow and inaccurate computations of transcendental functions .
meanwhile , hewlett-packard ( hp ) had been developing a pocket calculator .
launched in early *num* , it was unlike the other basic four-function pocket calculators then available in that it was the first pocket calculator with " scientific " functions that could replace a slide rule .
the $395 hp-35 , along with nearly all later hp engineering calculators , used reverse polish notation ( rpn ) , also called postfix notation .
a calculation like " *num* plus *num* " is , using rpn , performed by pressing , , , and ; instead of the algebraic infix notation : , , , .
it had *num* buttons and was based on mostek mk6020 chip .
the first soviet " scientific " pocket-sized calculator the " b3-18 " was completed by the end of *num* .
in *num* , texas instruments ( ti ) introduced the sr-10 , ( " sr " signifying slide rule ) an " algebraic entry " pocket calculator using scientific notation for $150 .
shortly after the sr-11 featured an added key for entering pi ( π ) .
it was followed the next year by the sr-50 which added log and trig functions to compete with the hp-35 , and in *num* the mass-marketed ti-30 line which is still produced .
in *num* a new company , calculated industries arose which focused on specialized markets .
their first calculator , the loan arranger ( *num* ) was a pocket calculator marketed to the real estate industry with preprogrammed functions to simplify the process of calculating payments and future values .
in *num* , ci launched a calculator for the construction industry called the construction master which came preprogrammed with common construction calculations ( such as angles , stairs , roofing math , pitch , rise , run , and feet-inch fraction conversions ) .
this would be the first in a line of construction related calculators .
the first desktop " programmable calculators " were produced in the mid-1960s by mathatronics and casio ( al-1000 ) .
these machines were very heavy and costly .
the first programmable pocket calculator was the hp-65 , in *num* ; it had a capacity of *num* instructions , and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader .
two years later the hp-25c introduced " continuous memory " , i .
e .
, programs and data were retained in cmos memory during power-off .
in *num* , hp released the first " alphanumeric " , programmable , " expandable " calculator , the hp-41c .
it could be expanded with random access memory ( ram , for memory ) and read-only memory ( rom , for software ) modules , and peripherals like bar code readers , microcassette and floppy disk drives , paper-roll thermal printers , and miscellaneous communication interfaces ( rs-232 , hp-il , hp-ib ) .
the first soviet programmable desktop calculator iskra *num* , powered by the power grid , was released at the start of the 1970s .
the first soviet pocket battery-powered programmable calculator , elektronika " b3-21 " , was developed by the end of *num* and released at the start of *num* .
the successor of b3-21 , the elektronika b3-34 wasn't backward compatible with b3-21 , even if it kept the reverse polish notation ( rpn ) .
thus b3-34 defined a new command set , which later was used in a series of later programmable soviet calculators .
despite very limited abilities ( *num* bytes of instruction memory and about *num* stack and addressable registers ) , people managed to write all kinds of programs for them , including adventure games and libraries of calculus-related functions for engineers .
hundreds , perhaps thousands , of programs were written for these machines , from practical scientific and business software , which were used in real-life offices and labs , to fun games for children .
the elektronika mk-52 calculator ( using the extended b3-34 command set , and featuring internal eeprom memory for storing programs and external interface for eeprom cards and other periphery ) was used in soviet spacecraft program ( for soyuz tm-7 flight ) as a backup of the board computer .
this series of calculators was also noted for a large number of highly counter-intuitive mysterious undocumented features , somewhat similar to " synthetic programming " of the american hp-41 , which were exploited by applying normal arithmetic operations to error messages , jumping to nonexistent addresses and other methods .
a number of respected monthly publications , including the popular science magazine " nauka i zhizn " ( " наука и жизнь " , " science and life " ) , featured special columns , dedicated to optimization methods for calculator programmers and updates on undocumented features for hackers , which grew into a whole esoteric science with many branches , named " yeggogology " ( " еггогология " ) .
the error messages on those calculators appear as a russian word " yeggog " ( " еггог " ) which , unsurprisingly , is translated to " error " .
a similar hacker culture in the usa revolved around the hp-41 , which was also noted for a large number of undocumented features and was much more powerful than b3-34 .
through the 1970s the hand-held electronic calculator underwent rapid development .
the red led and blue / green vacuum fluorescent displays consumed a lot of power and the calculators either had a short battery life ( often measured in hours , so rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries were common ) or were large so that they could take larger , higher capacity batteries .
in the early 1970s liquid-crystal displays ( lcds ) were in their infancy and there was a great deal of concern that they only had a short operating lifetime .
busicom introduced the busicom " le-120a " handy" " calculator , the first pocket-sized calculator and the first with an led display , and announced the busicom " lc " with lcd .
however , there were problems with this display and the calculator never went on sale .
the first successful calculators with lcds were manufactured by rockwell international and sold from *num* by other companies under such names as : dataking " lc-800 " , harden " dt / *num* " , ibico " *num* " , lloyds " *num* " , lloyds " *num* " , prismatic " *num* " ( a .
k .
a .
" p500 " ) , rapid data " rapidman 1208lc " .
the lcds were an early form using the " dynamic scattering mode dsm " with the numbers appearing as bright against a dark background .
to present a high-contrast display these models illuminated the lcd using a filament lamp and solid plastic light guide , which negated the low power consumption of the display .
these models appear to have been sold only for a year or two .
a more successful series of calculators using a reflective dsm-lcd was launched in *num* by sharp inc with the sharp " el-805 " , which was a slim pocket calculator .
this , and another few similar models , used sharp's " calculator on substrate " ( cos ) technology .
an extension of one glass plate needed for the liquid crystal display was used as a substrate to mount the needed chips based on a new hybrid technology .
the cos technology may have been too costly since it was only used in a few models before sharp reverted to conventional circuit boards .
in the mid-1970s the first calculators appeared with field-effect , " twisted nematic " ( tn ) lcds with dark numerals against a grey background , though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them to cut out damaging ultraviolet rays .
the advantage of lcds is that they are passive light modulators reflecting light , which require much less power than light-emitting displays such as leds or vfds .
this led the way to the first credit-card-sized calculators , such as the casio " mini card lc-78 " of *num* , which could run for months of normal use on button cells .
there were also improvements to the electronics inside the calculators .
all of the logic functions of a calculator had been squeezed into the first " calculator on a chip " integrated circuits ( ics ) in *num* , but this was leading edge technology of the time and yields were low and costs were high .
many calculators continued to use two or more ics , especially the scientific and the programmable ones , into the late 1970s .
the power consumption of the integrated circuits was also reduced , especially with the introduction of cmos technology .
appearing in the sharp " el-801 " in *num* , the transistors in the logic cells of cmos ics only used any appreciable power when they changed state .
the led and vfd displays often required added driver transistors or ics , whereas the lcds were more amenable to being driven directly by the calculator ic itself .
with this low power consumption came the possibility of using solar cells as the power source , realised around *num* by calculators such as the royal " solar *num* " , sharp " el-8026 " , and teal " photon " .
at the start of the 1970s , hand-held electronic calculators were very costly , at two or three weeks ' wages , and so were a luxury item .
the high price was due to their construction requiring many mechanical and electronic components which were costly to produce , and production runs that were too small to exploit economies of scale .
many firms saw that there were good profits to be made in the calculator business with the margin on such high prices .
however , the cost of calculators fell as components and their production methods improved , and the effect of economies of scale was felt .
by *num* , the cost of the cheapest four-function pocket calculator had dropped to a few dollars , about *num* / *ord* of the cost five years before .
the results of this were that the pocket calculator was affordable , and that it was now difficult for the manufacturers to make a profit from calculators , leading to many firms dropping out of the business or closing down .
the firms that survived making calculators tended to be those with high outputs of higher quality calculators , or producing high-specification scientific and programmable calculators .
the first calculator capable of symbolic computing was the hp-28c , released in *num* .
it could , for example , solve quadratic equations symbolically .
the first graphing calculator was the casio fx-7000g released in *num* .
the two leading manufacturers , hp and ti , released increasingly feature-laden calculators during the 1980s and 1990s .
at the turn of the millennium , the line between a graphing calculator and a handheld computer was not always clear , as some very advanced calculators such as the ti-89 , the voyage *num* and hp-49g could differentiate and integrate functions , solve differential equations , run word processing and pim software , and connect by wire or ir to other calculators / computers .
the hp 12c financial calculator is still produced .
it was introduced in *num* and is still being made with few changes .
the hp 12c featured the reverse polish notation mode of data entry .
in *num* several new models were released , including an improved version of the hp 12c , the " hp 12c platinum edition " which added more memory , more built-in functions , and the addition of the algebraic mode of data entry .
calculated industries competed with the hp 12c in the mortgage and real estate markets by differentiating the key labeling ; changing the “i” , “pv” , “fv” to easier labeling terms such as " int " , " term " , " pmt " , and not using the reverse polish notation .
however , ci's more successful calculators involved a line of construction calculators , which evolved and expanded in the 1990s to present .
according to mark bollman , a mathematics and calculator historian and associate professor of mathematics at albion college , the " construction master is the first in a long and profitable line of ci construction calculators " which carried them through the 1980s , 1990s , and to the present .
personal computers often come with a calculator utility program that emulates the appearance and functions of a calculator , using the graphical user interface to portray a calculator .
one such example is windows calculator .
most personal data assistants ( pdas ) and smartphones also have such a feature .
in most countries , students use calculators for schoolwork .
there was some initial resistance to the idea out of fear that basic or elementary arithmetic skills would suffer .
there remains disagreement about the importance of the ability to perform calculations " in the head " , with some curricula restricting calculator use until a certain level of proficiency has been obtained , while others concentrate more on teaching estimation methods and problem-solving .
research suggests that inadequate guidance in the use of calculating tools can restrict the kind of mathematical thinking that students engage in .
others have argued that calculator use can even cause core mathematical skills to atrophy , or that such use can prevent understanding of advanced algebraic concepts .
in december *num* the uk's minister of state for schools , nick gibb , voiced concern that children can become " too dependent " on the use of calculators .
as a result , the use of calculators is to be included as part of a review of the curriculum .
in the united states , many math educators and boards of education have enthusiastically endorsed the national council of teachers of mathematics ( nctm ) standards and actively promoted the use of classroom calculators from kindergarten through high school .
acetylene acetylene ( systematic name : ethyne ) is the chemical compound with the formula ch .
it is a hydrocarbon and the simplest alkyne .
this colorless gas is widely used as a fuel and a chemical building block .
it is unstable in its pure form and thus is usually handled as a solution .
pure acetylene is odorless , but commercial grades usually have a marked odor due to impurities .
as an alkyne , acetylene is unsaturated because its two carbon atoms are bonded together in a triple bond .
the carbon–carbon triple bond places all four atoms in the same straight line , with cch bond angles of 180° .
acetylene was discovered in *num* by edmund davy , who identified it as a " new carburet of hydrogen " .
it was an accidental discovery while attempting to isolate potassium metal .
by heating potassium carbonate with carbon at very high temperatures , he produced a residue of what is now known as potassium carbide , ( kc ) , which reacted with water to release the new gas .
it was rediscovered in *num* by french chemist marcellin berthelot , who coined the name " acétylène " .
berthelot's empirical formula for acetylene ( ch ) , as well as the alternative name " quadricarbure d'hydrogène " ( " hydrogen quadricarbide " ) , were incorrect because chemists at that time used the wrong atomic mass for carbon ( *num* instead of *num* ) .
berthelot was able to prepare this gas by passing vapours of organic compounds ( methanol , ethanol , etc .
) through a red-hot tube and collecting the effluent .
he also found that acetylene was formed by sparking electricity through mixed cyanogen and hydrogen gases .
berthelot later obtained acetylene directly by passing hydrogen between the poles of a carbon arc .
commercially available acetylene gas could smell foul due to the impurities divinyl sulfide and phosphine .
since the 1950s , acetylene has mainly been manufactured by the partial combustion of methane .
it is a recovered side product in production of ethylene by cracking of hydrocarbons .
approximately *num* , *num* tonnes were produced by this method in *num* .
its presence in ethylene is usually undesirable because of its explosive character and its ability to poison ziegler–natta catalysts .
it is selectively hydrogenated into ethylene , usually using pd–ag catalysts .
until the 1950s , when oil supplanted coal as the chief source of reduced carbon , acetylene ( and the aromatic fraction from coal tar ) was the main source of organic chemicals in the chemical industry .
it was prepared by the hydrolysis of calcium carbide , a reaction discovered by friedrich wöhler in *num* and still familiar to students : calcium carbide production requires extremely high temperatures , ~2000 °c , necessitating the use of an electric arc furnace .
in the us , this process was an important part of the *ord* century revolution in chemistry enabled by the massive hydroelectric power project at niagara falls .
in terms of valence bond theory , in each carbon atom the 2s orbital hybridizes with one 2p orbital thus forming an sp hybrid .
the other two 2p orbitals remain unhybridized .
the two ends of the two sp hybrid orbital overlap to form a strong σ valence bond between the carbons , while on each of the other two ends hydrogen atoms attach also by σ bonds .
the two unchanged 2p orbitals form a pair of weaker π bonds .
since acetylene is a linear symmetrical molecule , it possesses the d point group .
at atmospheric pressure , acetylene cannot exist as a liquid and does not have a melting point .
the triple point on the phase diagram corresponds to the melting point ( −80 .
*num* °c ) at the minimal pressure at which liquid acetylene can exist ( *num* .
*num* atm ) .
at temperatures below the triple point , solid acetylene can change directly to the vapour ( gas ) by sublimation .
the sublimation point at atmospheric pressure is −84 .
*num* °c .
at room temperature , the solubility of acetylene in acetone is *num* .
*num* g per kg .
for the same amount of dmf , the solubility is *num* g .
at *num* .
*num* bar , the solubility increases to *num* .
*num* and *num* .
*num* g for acetone and dmf , respectively .
these solvents are used in pressurized gas cylinders .
approximately *num* % of acetylene is supplied by the industrial gases industry for oxyacetylene gas welding and cutting due to the high temperature of the flame .
combustion of acetylene with oxygen produces a flame of over , releasing *num* .
*num* kj / g .
oxyacetylene is the hottest burning common fuel gas .
acetylene is the third-hottest natural chemical flame after dicyanoacetylene's and cyanogen at .
oxy-acetylene welding was a popular welding process in previous decades .
the development and advantages of arc-based welding processes have made oxy-fuel welding nearly extinct for many applications .
acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly .
on the other hand , oxy-acetylene welding " equipment " is quite versatile – not only because the torch is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding ( as in certain artistic applications ) , but also because it lends itself easily to brazing , braze-welding , metal heating ( for annealing or tempering , bending or forming ) , the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts , and other applications .
bell canada cable-repair technicians still use portable acetylene-fuelled torch kits as a soldering tool for sealing lead sleeve splices in manholes and in some aerial locations .
oxyacetylene welding may also be used in areas where electricity is not readily accessible .
as well , oxy-fuel cutting is still popular , and oxy-acetylene cutting is used in many metal fabrication shops .
for use in welding and cutting , the working pressures must be controlled by a regulator , since above , if subjected to a shockwave ( caused , for example , by a flashback ) , acetylene decomposes explosively into hydrogen and carbon .
calcium carbide was used to generate acetylene used in the lamps for portable or remote applications .
it was used for miners and cavers before the widespread use of incandescent lighting ; or many years later low-power / high-lumen led lighting ; and is still used by mining industries in some nations without workplace safety laws .
it was also used as an early light source for lighthouses .
except in china , use of acetylene as a chemical feedstock has declined by *num* % from *num* to *num* owing to cost and environmental considerations .
acetylene can be semihydrogenated to ethylene , providing a feedstock for a variety of polyethylene plastics .
another major application of acetylene , especially in china is its conversion to acrylic acid derivatives .
these derivatives form products such as acrylic fibers , glasses , paints , resins , and polymers .
in *num* , the russian chemist mikhail kucherov described the hydration of acetylene to acetaldehyde using catalysts such as mercury ( ii ) bromide .
before the advent of the wacker process , this reaction was conducted on an industrial scale .
the polymerization of acetylene with ziegler–natta catalysts produces polyacetylene films .
polyacetylene , a chain of ch centres with alternating single and double bonds , was one of the first discovered organic semiconductors .
its reaction with iodine produces a highly electrically conducting material .
although such materials are not useful , these discoveries led to the developments of organic semiconductors , as recognized by the nobel prize in chemistry in *num* to alan j .
heeger , alan g macdiarmid , and hideki shirakawa .
in the early *ord* century acetylene was widely used for illumination , including street lighting in some towns .
most early automobiles used carbide lamps before the adoption of electric headlights .
acetylene is sometimes used for carburization ( that is , hardening ) of steel when the object is too large to fit into a furnace .
acetylene is used to volatilize carbon in radiocarbon dating .
the carbonaceous material in an archeological sample is treated with lithium metal in a small specialized research furnace to form lithium carbide ( also known as lithium acetylide ) .
the carbide can then be reacted with water , as usual , to form acetylene gas to feed into a mass spectrometer to measure the isotopic ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 .
the energy richness of the c≡c triple bond and the rather high solubility of acetylene in water make it a suitable substrate for bacteria , provided an adequate source is available .
a number of bacteria living on acetylene have been identified .
the enzyme acetylene hydratase catalyzes the hydration of acetylene to give acetaldehyde : acetylene is a moderately common chemical in the universe , often associated with the atmospheres of gas giants .
one curious discovery of acetylene is on enceladus , a moon of saturn .
natural acetylene is believed to form from catalytic decomposition of long-chain hydrocarbons at temperatures of and above .
since such temperatures are highly unlikely on such a small distant body , this discovery is potentially suggestive of catalytic reactions within that moon , making it a promising site to search for prebiotic chemistry .
in vinylation reactions , h-x compounds add across the triple bond .
alcohols and phenols add to acetylene to give vinyl ethers .
thiols give vinyl thioethers .
similarly , vinylpyrrolidone and vinylcarbazole are produced industrially by vinylation of 2-pyrrolidone and carbazole .
the hydration of acetylene is a vinylation reaction , but the resulting vinyl alcohol isomerizes to acetaldehyde .
the reaction is catalyzed by mercury salts .
this reaction once was the dominant technology for acetaldehyde production , but it has been displaced by the wacker process , which affords acetaldehyde by oxidation of ethylene , a cheaper feedstock .
a similar situation applies to the conversion of acetylene to the valuable vinyl chloride by hydrochlorination vs the oxychlorination of ethylene .
acetylene adds to ketones and aldehydes in the presence of base catalysts .
with carbonyl groups to give α-ethynyl alcohols in ethynylation reactions : formaldehyde gives sequentially propargyl alcohol and butynediol .
*num* , 4-butynediol is produced industrially in this way from formaldehyde and acetylene .
walter reppe discovered that in the presence of catalysts , acetylene react to give a wide range of industrially significant chemicals .
with carbon monoxide , acetylene reacts to give acrylic acid , or acrylic esters , which can be used to produce acrylic glass : acetylene and its derivatives ( 2-butyne , diphenylacetylene , etc ) form complexes with transition metals .
its bonding to the metal is somewhat similar to that of ethylene complexes .
these complexes are intermediates in many catalytic reactions such as alkyne trimerisation to benzene , tetramerization to cyclooctatetraene , and carbonylation to hydroquinone : in the presence of certain transition metals , alkynes undergo alkyne metathesis .
metal acetylides , species of the formula lm-cr , are also common .
copper ( i ) acetylide and silver acetylide can be formed in aqueous solutions with ease due to a poor solubility equilibrium .
acetylene has a p"k " of *num* , acetylene can be deprotonated by a superbase to form an acetylide : various organometallic and inorganic reagents are effective .
acetylene is not especially toxic , but when generated from calcium carbide , it can contain toxic impurities such as traces of phosphine and arsine , which give it a distinct garlic-like smell .
it is also highly flammable , as are most light hydrocarbons , hence its use in welding .
its most singular hazard is associated with its intrinsic instability , especially when it is pressurized : under certain conditions acetylene can react in an exothermic addition-type reaction to form a number of products , typically benzene and / or vinylacetylene , possibly in addition to carbon and hydrogen .
consequently , acetylene , if initiated by intense heat or a shockwave , can decompose explosively if the absolute pressure of the gas exceeds about .
most regulators and pressure gauges on equipment report gauge pressure , and the safe limit for acetylene therefore is *num* kpa , or *num* psig .
it is therefore supplied and stored dissolved in acetone or dimethylformamide ( dmf ) , contained in a gas cylinder with a porous filling ( agamassan ) , which renders it safe to transport and use , given proper handling .
acetylene cylinders should be used in the upright position to avoid withdrawing acetone during use .
information on safe storage of acetylene in upright cylinders is provided by the osha , compressed gas association , united states mine safety and health administration ( msha ) , eiga , and other agencies .
copper catalyses the decomposition of acetylene , and as a result acetylene should not be transported in copper pipes .
brass pipe fittings should also be avoided .
cylinders should be stored in an area segregated from oxidizers to avoid exacerbated reaction in case of fire / leakage .
acetylene cylinders should not be stored in confined spaces , enclosed vehicles , garages , and buildings , to avoid unintended leakage leading to explosive atmosphere .
in the us , national electric code ( nec ) requires consideration for hazardous areas including those where acetylene may be released during accidents or leaks .
consideration may include electrical classification and use of listed group a electrical components in usa .
further information on determining the areas requiring special consideration is in nfpa *num* .
in europe , atex also requires consideration for hazardous areas where flammable gases may be released during accidents or leaks .
erfurt erfurt ( ) is the capital and largest city in the state of thuringia , central germany .
erfurt lies in the southern part of the thuringian basin , within the wide valley of the gera river .
it is located south-west of leipzig , south-west of berlin , north of munich and north-east of frankfurt .
together with neighbouring cities weimar and jena it forms the central metropolitan area of thuringia with approximately *num* , *num* inhabitants .
erfurt's old town is one of the best preserved medieval city centres in germany .
tourist attractions include the krämerbrücke ( merchants ' bridge ) , the old synagogue , the ensemble of erfurt cathedral and " severikirche " ( st severus's church ) and petersberg citadel , one of the largest and best preserved town fortresses in europe .
the city's economy is based on agriculture , horticulture and microelectronics .
its central location has led to it becoming a logistics hub for germany and central europe .
erfurt hosts the second-largest trade fair in eastern germany ( after leipzig ) as well as the public television children’s channel kika .
the city is situated on the via regia , a medieval trade and pilgrims ' road network .
modern day erfurt is also a hub for ice high speed trains and other german and european transport networks .
erfurt was first mentioned in *num* , as saint boniface founded the diocese .
although the town did not belong to any of the thuringian states politically , it quickly became the economic centre of the region and it was a member of the hanseatic league .
it was part of the electorate of mainz during the holy roman empire , and later became part of the kingdom of prussia in *num* .
from *num* until *num* erfurt was part of the german democratic republic ( east germany ) .
the university of erfurt was founded in *num* , making it the first university to be established within the geographic area which constitutes modern-day germany .
it closed in *num* and was re-established in *num* , with the main modern campus on what was a teachers ' training college .
martin luther ( 1483-1546 ) was its most famous student , studying there from *num* before entering st augustine's monastery in *num* .
other noted erfurters include the medieval philosopher and mystic meister eckhart ( c .
1260-1328 ) , the baroque composer johann pachelbel ( 1653-1706 ) and the sociologist max weber ( 1864-1920 ) .
erfurt is an old germanic settlement .
the earliest evidence of human settlement dates from the prehistoric era ; archaeological finds from the north of erfurt revealed human traces from the paleolithic period , ca .
*num* , *num* bce .
the melchendorf dig in the southern city part showed a settlement from the neolithic period .
the thuringii inhabited the erfurt area ca .
*num* and gave their name to thuringia ca .
*num* .
the town is first mentioned in *num* under the name of " erphesfurt " : in that year , saint boniface wrote to pope zachary to inform him that he had established three dioceses in central germany , one of them " in a place called erphesfurt , which for a long time has been inhabited by pagan natives .
" all three dioceses ( the other two were würzburg and büraburg ) were confirmed by zachary the next year , though in *num* erfurt was brought into the diocese of mainz .
that the place was populous already is borne out by archeological evidence , which includes *num* graves and six horse burials from the sixth and seventh centuries .
throughout the middle ages , erfurt was an important trading town because of its location , near a ford across the gera river .
together with the other five thuringian woad towns of gotha , tennstedt , arnstadt and langensalza it was the centre of the german woad trade , which made those cities very wealthy .
erfurt was the junction of important trade routes : the via regia was one of the most used east–west roads between france and russia ( via frankfurt , erfurt , leipzig and wrocław ) and another route in the north–south direction was the connection between the baltic sea ports ( e .
g .
lübeck ) and the potent upper italian city-states like venice and milan .
during the *ord* and *ord* centuries both the emperor and the electorate of mainz held some privileges in erfurt .
the german kings had an important monastery on petersberg hill and the archbishops of mainz collected taxes from the people .
around *num* , some people became free citizens by paying the annual " " ( liberation tax ) , which marks a first step in becoming an independent city .
during the *ord* century , as a sign of more and more independence , the citizens built a city wall around erfurt ( in the area of today's ) .
after *num* , independence was fulfilled and a city council was founded in *num* ; the town hall was built in *num* .
in the following decades , the council bought a city-owned territory around erfurt which consisted at its height of nearly *num* villages and castles and even another small town ( sömmerda ) .
erfurt became an important regional power between the landgraviate of thuringia around , the electorate of mainz to the west and the electorate of saxony to the east .
between *num* and *num* , erfurt was allied with the two other major thuringian cities ( mühlhausen and nordhausen ) in the thuringian city alliance and the three cities joined the hanseatic league together in *num* .
a peak in economic development was reached in the *ord* century , when the city had a population of *num* , *num* making it one of the largest in germany .
between *num* and *num* , a second and higher city wall was established .
in *num* , a first city fortress was built on cyriaksburg hill in the southwestern part of the town .
the jewish community of erfurt was founded in the *ord* century and became , together with mainz , worms and speyer , one of the most influential in germany .
their old synagogue is still extant and a museum today , as is the mikveh at gera river near .
in *num* , during the wave of black death jewish persecutions across europe , the jews of erfurt were rounded up , with more than *num* killed and the rest driven from the city .
before the persecution , a wealthy jewish merchant buried his property in the basement of his house .
in *num* , this treasure was found during construction works .
the erfurt treasure with various gold and silver objects is shown in the exhibition in the synagogue today .
only a few years after *num* , the jews moved back to erfurt and founded a second community , which was disbanded by the city council in *num* .
in *num* , the university of erfurt was founded .
together with the university of cologne it was one of the first city-owned universities in germany , while they were usually owned by the " .
some buildings of this old university are extant or restored in the " latin quarter " in the northern city centre ( like , student dorms " " and others , the hospital and the church of the university ) .
the university quickly became a hotspot of german cultural life in renaissance humanism with scholars like ulrich von hutten , helius eobanus hessus and justus jonas .
in *num* martin luther ( *num* - *num* ) moved to erfurt and began his studies at the university .
after *num* , he lived at st .
augustine's monastery as a friar .
in *num* he was ordained as a priest in erfurt cathedral .
he moved permanently to wittenberg in *num* .
erfurt was an early adopter of the protestant reformation , in *num* .
in *num* , the city became one of the first in europe to be officially bi-confessional with the hammelburg treaty .
it kept that status through all the following centuries .
the later *ord* and the *ord* century brought a slow economic decline of erfurt .
trade shrank , the population was falling and the university lost its influence .
the city's independence was endangered .
in *num* , the city and surrounding area were brought under the dominion of the electorate of mainz and the city lost its independence .
the electorate built a huge fortress on petersberg hill between *num* and *num* to control the city and instituted a governor to rule erfurt .
during the late *ord* century , erfurt saw another cultural peak .
governor karl theodor anton maria von dalberg had close relations with johann wolfgang von goethe , friedrich schiller , johann gottfried herder , christoph martin wieland and wilhelm von humboldt , who often visited him at his court in erfurt .
erfurt became part of the kingdom of prussia in *num* , to compensate for territories prussia lost to france on the left bank of the rhine .
in the capitulation of erfurt the city , its *num* , *num* prussian and saxon defenders under william vi , prince of orange-nassau , *num* artillery pieces , and the petersberg citadel and cyriaksburg citadel were handed over to the french on *num* october *num* ; name="petre *num* / / at the time of the capitulation , joachim murat , marshal of france , had about *num* , *num* troops near erfurt .
with the attachment of the saxe-weimar territory of blankenhain , the city became part of the first french empire in *num* as the principality of erfurt , directly subordinate to napoleon as an " imperial state domain " ( ) , separate from the confederation of the rhine , which the surrounding thuringian states had joined .
erfurt was administered by a civilian and military senate ( " ) under a french governor , based in the , previously the seat of city's governor under the electorate .
napoleon first visited the principality on *num* july *num* , inspecting the citadels and fortifications .
in *num* , the congress of erfurt was held with napoleon and alexander i of russia visiting the city .
during their administration , the french introduced street lighting and a tax on foreign horses to pay for maintaining the road surface .
the suffered under the french occupation , with its inventory being auctioned off to other local churches — including the organ , bells and even the tower of the chapel ( " ) — and the former monastery's library being donated to the university of erfurt ( and then to the boineburg library when the university closed in *num* ) .
similarly the cyriaksburg citadel was damaged by the french , with the city-side walls being partially dismantled in the hunt for imagined treasures from the convent , workers being paid from the sale of the building materials .
in *num* , to commemorate the birth of the prince imperial , a ceremonial column ( ' ) of wood and plaster was erected on the common .
similarly , the ' — a greek-style temple topped by a winged victory with shield , sword and lance and containing a bust of napoleon sculpted by friedrich döll — was erected in the ' woods , including a grotto with fountain and flower beds , using a large pond ( ' ) from the , inaugurated with ceremony on *num* august *num* after extravagant celebrations for napoleon's birthday , which were repeated in *num* with a concert in the conducted by louis spohr .
with the sixth coalition forming after french defeat in russia , on *num* february *num* napoleon ordered the petersburg citadel to prepare for siege , visiting the city on *num* april to inspect the fortifications , in particular both citadels .
on *num* july *num* , napoleon put , baron of the empire , in charge of the defences of erfurt .
however , when the french decreed that *num* men would be conscripted into the , the recruits were joined by other citizens in rioting on *num* july that led to *num* arrests , of whom *num* were sentenced to death by french court-martial ; as a result , the french ordered the closure of all inns and alehouses .
within a week of the sixth coalition's decisive victory at leipzig ( 16–19 october *num* ) , however , erfurt was besieged by prussian , austrian and russian troops under the command of prussian lt gen von kleist .
after a first capitulation signed by d'alton on *num* december *num* the french troops withdrew to the two fortresses of petersberg and cyriaksburg , allowing for the coalition forces to march into erfurt on *num* january *num* to jubilant greetings ; the ' ceremonial column was burned and destroyed as a symbol of the citizens ' oppression under the french ; similarly the ' was burned on *num* november *num* and completely destroyed by erfurters and their besiegers in *num* .
after a call for volunteers *num* days later , *num* erfurters joined the coalition armies in france .
finally , in may *num* , the french capitulated fully , with *num* , *num* french troops vacating the petersberg and cyriaksburg fortresses .
during the two and a half months of siege , the mortality rate rose in the city greatly ; *num* , *num* erfurt citizens died in *num* , around a thousand more than the previous year .
after the congress of vienna , erfurt was restored to prussia on *num* june *num* , becoming the capital of one of the three districts ( " " ) of the new province of saxony , but some southern and eastern parts of erfurter lands joined blankenhain in being transferred to the grand duchy of saxe-weimar-eisenach the following september .
although enclosed by thuringian territory in the west , south and east , the city remained part of the prussian province of saxony until *num* .
after the *num* revolution , many germans desired to have a united national state .
an attempt in this direction was the failed erfurt union of german states in *num* .
the industrial revolution reached erfurt in the 1840s , when the thuringian railway connecting berlin and frankfurt was built .
during the following years , many factories in different sectors were founded .
one of the biggest was the " royal gun factory of prussia " in *num* .
after the unification of germany in *num* , erfurt moved from the southern border of prussia to the centre of germany , so the fortifications of the city were no longer needed .
the demolition of the city fortifications in *num* led to a construction boom in erfurt , because it was now possible to build in the area formerly occupied by the city walls and beyond .
many public and private buildings emerged and the infrastructure ( such as a tramway , hospitals , and schools ) improved rapidly .
the number of inhabitants grew from *num* , *num* around *num* to *num* , *num* in *num* and the city expanded in all directions .
the " erfurt program " was adopted by the social democratic party of germany during its congress at erfurt in *num* .
between the wars , the city kept growing .
housing shortages were fought with building programmes and social infrastructure was broadened according to the welfare policy in the weimar republic .
the great depression between *num* and *num* led to a disaster for erfurt , nearly one out of three became unemployed .
conflicts between far-left and far-right-oriented milieus increased and many inhabitants supported the new nazi government and adolf hitler .
others , especially some communist workers , put up resistance against the new administration .
in *num* , the new synagogue was destroyed during the .
jews lost their property and emigrated or were deported to nazi concentration camps ( together with many communists ) .
in *num* , the company " topf and sons " began the manufacture of crematoria later becoming the market leader in this industry .
under the nazis , " ja topf & sons " supplied specially developed crematoria , ovens and associated plants to the auschwitz-birkenau , buchenwald and mauthausen-gusen concentration camps .
on *num* january *num* a memorial and museum dedicated to the holocaust victims was opened at the former company premises in erfurt .
bombed as a target of the oil campaign of world war ii , erfurt suffered only limited damage and was captured on *num* april *num* , by the us *ord* infantry division .
on *num* july , american troops left the city , which then became part of the soviet zone of occupation and eventually of the german democratic republic ( east germany ) .
in *num* , erfurt became the capital of thuringia , replacing weimar .
in *num* , the in the gdr were dissolved in favour of centralization under the new socialist government .
erfurt then became the capital of a new " " ( district ) .
in *num* , the of education was founded , followed by the of medicine in *num* , the first academic institutions in erfurt since the closing of the university in *num* .
on *num* march *num* , the east and west german heads of government willi stoph and willy brandt met in erfurt , the first such meeting since the division of germany .
during the 1970s and 1980s , as the economic situation in gdr worsened , many old buildings in city centre decayed , while the government fought against the housing shortage by building large settlements in the periphery .
the peaceful revolution of *num* / *num* led to german reunification .
with the re-formation of the state of thuringia in *num* , the city became the state capital .
after reunification , a deep economic crisis occurred in eastern germany .
many factories closed and many people lost their jobs and moved to the former west germany .
at the same time , many buildings were redeveloped and the infrastructure improved massively .
in *num* , the new university was opened , as was the fachhochschule in *num* .
between *num* and *num* , the economic situation improved as the unemployment rate decreased and new enterprises developed .
in addition , the population began to increase once again .
erfurt is situated in the south of the thuringian basin , a fertile agricultural area between the harz mountains to the north and the thuringian forest to the southwest .
whereas the northern parts of the city area are flat , the southern ones consist of hilly landscape up to *num* m of elevation .
in this part lies the municipal forest of " " with beeches and oaks as main tree species .
to the east and to the west are some non-forested hills so that the gera river valley within the town forms a basin .
north of the city are some gravel pits in operation , while others are abandoned , flooded and used as leisure areas .
erfurt has a humid continental climate ( dfb ) or an oceanic climate ( " cfb " ) according to the köppen climate classification system .
summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of and lows of .
winters are relatively cold with average high temperatures of and lows of .
the city's topography creates a microclimate caused by the location inside a basin with sometimes inversion in winter ( quite cold nights under ) and inadequate air circulation in summer .

leto ii atreides , the god emperor , has ruled the universe as a tyrant for *num* , *num* years after becoming a hybrid of human and giant sandworm in " children of dune " .
the death of all other sandworms , and his control of the remaining supply of the all-important drug melange , has allowed him to keep civilization under his complete command .
leto has been physically transformed into a worm , retaining only his human face and arms , and though he is now seemingly immortal and invulnerable to harm , he is prone to instinct-driven bouts of violence when provoked to anger .
as a result , his rule is one of religious awe and despotic fear .
leto has disbanded the landsraad to all but a few great houses ; the remaining powers defer to his authority , although they individually conspire against him in secret .
the fremen have long since lost their identity and military power , and have been replaced as the imperial army by the fish speakers , an all-female army who obey leto without question .
he has rendered the human population into a state of trans-galactic stagnation ; space travel is non-existent to most people in his empire , which he has deliberately kept to a near-medieval level of technological sophistication .
all of this he has done in accordance with a prophecy divined through precognition that will establish an enforced peace preventing humanity from destroying itself through aggressive behavior .
the desert planet arrakis has been terraformed into a lush forested biosphere , except for a single section of desert retained by leto for his citadel .
a string of duncan idaho gholas have served leto over the millennia , and leto has also fostered the bloodline of his twin sister ghanima .
her descendant moneo is leto's majordomo and closest confidante , while moneo's daughter siona has become the leader of an arrakis-based rebellion against leto .
she steals a set of secret records from his archives , not realizing that he has allowed it .
leto intends to breed siona with the latest duncan ghola , but is aware that the ghola , moved by his own morality , may try to assassinate him before this can occur .
the ixians send a new ambassador named hwi noree to serve leto , and though he realizes that she has been specifically designed and trained to ensnare him , he cannot resist falling in love with her .
she agrees to marry him .
leto tests siona by taking her out to the middle of the desert .
after improperly using her stillsuit to preserve moisture , dehydration forces her to accept leto's offer of spice essence from his body to replenish her .
awakened to leto's prophecy , known as the golden path , the experience convinces siona of the importance of the golden path .
she remains dedicated to leto's destruction , and an errant rainstorm demonstrates for her his mortal vulnerability to water .
siona and idaho overcome a searing mutual hatred of each other to plan an assassination .
as leto's wedding procession to tuono village moves across a high bridge over a river , siona orders one of her fish speakers to destroy the support beams with a lasgun .
the bridge collapses and leto's entourage , including hwi , plunge to their deaths into the river below .
leto's body rends apart in the water ; the sandtrout which are part of his body encyst the water and scurry off , while the worm portion burns and disintegrates on the shore .
a dying leto reveals his secret breeding program among the atreides to produce a human who is invisible to prescient vision .
siona is the finished result , and she and her descendants will retain this ability .
he explains that humanity is now free to scatter throughout the universe , never again to face complete destruction .
after revealing the location of his secret spice hoard , leto dies , leaving duncan and siona to face the task of managing the empire .
in " god emperor of dune " , frank herbert analyzes the cyclical patterns of human society , as well as humanity's evolutionary drives .
using his ancestral memories , leto ii has knowledge of the entirety of human history and is able to recall the effects and patterns of tyrannical institutions , from the babylonian empire through the jesuits on ancient earth , and thus builds an empire existing as a complete nexus encompassing all these methods .
this galactic empire differs from the historical tyrants in that it is deliberately designed to end in destruction , and is only instituted in the first place as part of a plan to rescue humanity from an absolute destruction which leto ii has foreseen through his oracular visions .
leto ii personally explores the emergent effects of civilization , noting that most hierarchical structures are remnants of evolutionary urges toward safety .
thus , by forming a perfectly safe and stable empire , leto ii delivers a message to be felt throughout history .
stylistically , the novel is permeated by quotations from , and speeches by its main character , leto , to a degree unseen in any of the other " dune " novels .
in part , this stylistic shift is an artifact of how herbert wrote it : the first draft was written almost entirely in the first-person narrative voice , only being revised in later drafts to insert more third-person narration of events .
context switch in computing , a context switch is the process of storing the state of a process or of a thread , so that it can be restored and execution resumed from the same point later .
this allows multiple processes to share a single cpu , and is an essential feature of a multitasking operating system .
the precise meaning of the phrase “context switch” varies significantly in usage .
in a multitasking context , it refers to the process of storing the system state for one task , so that task can be paused and another task resumed .
a context switch can also occur as the result of an interrupt , such as when a task needs to access disk storage , freeing up cpu time for other tasks .
some operating systems also require a context switch to move between user mode and kernel mode tasks .
the process of context switching can have a negative impact on system performance , although the size of this effect depends on the nature of the switch being performed .
context switches are usually computationally intensive , and much of the design of operating systems is to optimize the use of context switches .
switching from one process to another requires a certain amount of time for doing the administration saving and loading registers and memory maps , updating various tables and lists , etc .
what is actually involved in a context switch varies between these senses and between processors and operating systems .
for example , in the linux kernel , context switching involves switching registers , stack pointer , and program counter , but is independent of address space switching , though in a process switch an address space switch also happens .
further still , analogous context switching happens between user threads , notably green threads , and is often very light-weight , saving and restoring minimal context .
in extreme cases , such as switching between goroutines in go , a context switch is equivalent to a coroutine yield , which is only marginally more expensive than a subroutine call .
there are three potential triggers for a context switch : most commonly , within some scheduling scheme , one process must be switched out of the cpu so another process can run .
this context switch can be triggered by the process making itself unrunnable , such as by waiting for an i / o or synchronization operation to complete .
on a pre-emptive multitasking system , the scheduler may also switch out processes which are still runnable .
to prevent other processes from being starved of cpu time , preemptive schedulers often configure a timer interrupt to fire when a process exceeds its time slice .
this interrupt ensures that the scheduler will gain control to perform a context switch .
modern architectures are interrupt driven .
this means that if the cpu requests data from a disk , for example , it does not need to busy-wait until the read is over ; it can issue the request and continue with some other execution .
when the read is over , the cpu can be " interrupted " and presented with the read .
for interrupts , a program called an " interrupt handler " is installed , and it is the interrupt handler that handles the interrupt from the disk .
when an interrupt occurs , the hardware automatically switches a part of the context ( at least enough to allow the handler to return to the interrupted code ) .
the handler may save additional context , depending on details of the particular hardware and software designs .
often only a minimal part of the context is changed in order to minimize the amount of time spent handling the interrupt .
the kernel does not spawn or schedule a special process to handle interrupts , but instead the handler executes in the ( often partial ) context established at the beginning of interrupt handling .
once interrupt servicing is complete , the context in effect before the interrupt occurred is restored so that the interrupted process can resume execution in its proper state .
when a transition between user mode and kernel mode is required in an operating system , a context switch is not necessary ; a mode transition is " not " by itself a context switch .
however , depending on the operating system , a context switch may also take place at this time .
in a switch , the state of process currently executing must be saved somehow , so that when it is rescheduled , this state can be restored .
the process state includes all the registers that the process may be using , especially the program counter , plus any other operating system specific data that may be necessary .
this is usually stored in a data structure called a " process control block " ( pcb ) or " switchframe " .
the pcb might be stored on a per-process stack in kernel memory ( as opposed to the user-mode call stack ) , or there may be some specific operating system defined data structure for this information .
a handle to the pcb is added to a queue of processes that are ready to run , often called the " ready queue " .
since the operating system has effectively suspended the execution of one process , it can then switch context by choosing a process from the ready queue and restoring its pcb .
in doing so , the program counter from the pcb is loaded , and thus execution can continue in the chosen process .
process and thread priority can influence which process is chosen from the ready queue ( i .
e .
, it may be a priority queue ) .
context switching itself has a cost in performance , due to running the task scheduler , tlb flushes , and indirectly due to sharing the cpu cache between multiple tasks .
switching between threads of a single process can be faster than between two separate processes , because threads share the same virtual memory maps , so a tlb flush is not necessary .
context switching can be performed primarily by software or hardware .
some processors , like the intel *num* and its successors , have hardware support for context switches , by making use of a special data segment designated the task state segment or tss .
a task switch can be explicitly triggered with a call or jmp instruction targeted at a tss descriptor in the global descriptor table .
it can occur implicitly when an interrupt or exception is triggered if there's a task gate in the interrupt descriptor table .
when a task switch occurs the cpu can automatically load the new state from the tss .
as with other tasks performed in hardware , one would expect this to be rather fast ; however , mainstream operating systems , including windows and linux , do not use this feature .
bohemian a bohemian ( ) is a resident of bohemia , a region of the czech republic or the former kingdom of bohemia , a region of the former crown of bohemia ( lands of the bohemian crown ) .
in english , the word " bohemian " was used to denote the czech people as well as the czech language before the word " czech " became prevalent in the early *ord* century .
in a separate meaning , " bohemian " may also denote " a socially unconventional person , especially one who is involved in the arts " according to oxford dictionaries online .
( see bohemianism ) .
the name " bohemia " derives from the name of the boii , a celtic tribe who inhabited that area towards the latter la tène period .
the toponym " boiohaemum , " first attested by tacitus , is commonly taken to mean " home of the boii " ( from the germanic root *"haima- " meaning " world , home " ) .
the word " bohemian " has never been widely used by the local czech population .
in czech , the region since the early middle ages has been called " čechy " but also , especially during the period of restoration / emancipation of the czech language and nation , as " čechie .
" another term , stressing the importance of the state / nation , is " království české " ( " czech kingdom " ) in czech , or " böhmen " ( königreich ) in german .
its mainly czech-speaking inhabitants were called " čechové " ( in modern czech " češi " ) .
in most other western european vernaculars and in latin ( as " bohemi " ) , the word " bohemian " or a derivate was used .
if the czech ethnic origin was to be stressed , combinations such as " bohemian of bohemian language " ( " čech českého jazyka " ) , " a real bohemian " ( " pravý čech " ) , etc .
were used .
it was not until the *ord* century that other european languages began to use words related to " czechs " ( as in english , " tschechien " in german , " tchèques " in french ) in a deliberate ( and successful ) attempt to distinguish between ethnic slavic-speaking bohemians and other inhabitants of bohemia .
the latter were mostly ethnic germans , who identified as " german bohemians " ( " deutschböhmen " ) or simply as " bohemians " ( " böhmen " ) .
in many parts of europe , state citizenship was not identical with ethnicity and language , and the various peoples were usually identified by their language .
ethnic boundaries in bohemia were not always sharp , and people very often were bilingual .
intermarriages across language borders were also common .
native czech speakers often spoke german and many native german speakers spoke czech with varying fluency , particularly in areas with many czech speakers .
currently , the word " bohemians " is sometimes used when speaking about persons from bohemia of all ethnic origins , especially before the year *num* , when the kingdom of bohemia ceased to exist .
it is also used to distinguish between inhabitants of the western part ( bohemia proper ) of the state , and the eastern ( moravia ) or north-eastern ( silesia ) parts .
the different term " bohemianism " was associated with " a socially unconventional person , especially one who is involved in the arts " , that comes from the french word " bohémien .
african national congress the african national congress ( anc ) is the republic of south africa's governing political party .
it has been the ruling party of post-apartheid south africa on the national level , beginning with the election of nelson mandela in the *num* election .
today , the anc remains the dominant political party in south africa , winning every election since *num* .
cyril ramaphosa , the incumbent president of south africa , has served as leader of the anc since *num* december *num* .
founded on *num* january *num* by john langalibalele dube in bloemfontein as the south african native national congress ( sannc ) , its primary mission was to give voting rights to black and mixed-race africans and , from the 1940s , to end apartheid .
the anc originally attempted to use nonviolent protests to end apartheid , however , the sharpeville massacre resulted in the deaths of *num* black africans and contributed to deteriorating relations with the south african government .
on *num* april *num* , the administration of charles robberts swart , banned the anc and forced the party to leave south africa .
after the ban , the anc formed the umkhonto we sizwe ( spear of the nation ) to fight against apartheid utilizing guerrilla warfare and sabotage .
on *num* february *num* , state president f .
w .
de klerk lifted the ban on the anc and released nelson mandela on *num* february *num* .
on *num* march *num* , the apartheid referendum was passed by the voters removing apartheid and allowing the anc to run in the *num* election .
since the *num* election the anc has performed better than *num* % in all general elections , including the most recent *num* election .
the founding of the sannc was in direct response to injustice against black south africans at the hands of the government then in power .
it can be said that the sannc had its origins in a pronouncement by pixley ka isaka seme who said in *num* , " forget all the past differences among africans and unite in one national organisation .
" the sannc was founded the following year on *num* january *num* .
the government of the newly formed union of south africa began a systematic oppression of black people in south africa .
the land act was promulgated in *num* forcing many black south africans from their farms into the cities and towns to work , and to restrict their movement within south africa .
by *num* , the sannc was leading a campaign against passes ( an id which black south africans had to possess ) .
however , it then became dormant in the mid-1920s .
during that time , black people were also represented by the icu and the previously white-only communist party .
in *num* , the organisation became the african national congress , and in *num* the anc supported a militant mineworkers ' strike .
by *num* , j .
t .
gumede ( president of the anc ) proposed co-operation with the communists in a bid to revitalise the organisation , but he was voted out of power in the 1930s .
this led to the anc becoming largely ineffectual and inactive , until the mid-1940s when the anc was remodelled as a mass movement .
the anc responded to attacks on the rights of black south africans , as well as calling for strikes , boycotts , and defiance .
this led to a later defiance campaign in the 1950s , a mass movement of resistance to apartheid .
the government tried to stop the anc by banning party leaders and enacting new laws to stop the anc , however these measures ultimately proved to be ineffective .
in *num* , the congress of the people officially adopted the freedom charter , stating the core principles of the south african congress alliance , which consisted of the african national congress and its allies the south african communist party ( sacp ) , the south african indian congress , the south african congress of democrats ( cod ) and the coloured people's congress .
the government claimed that this was a communist document , and consequently leaders of the anc and congress were arrested .
*num* saw the sharpeville massacre , in which *num* people were killed when police opened fire on anti-apartheid protesters .
umkhonto we sizwe or mk , translated " the spear of the nation " , was the military wing of the anc .
partly in response to the sharpeville massacre of *num* , individual members of the anc found it necessary to consider violence to combat what passive protest had failed to quell .
in co-operation with the south african communist party , mk was founded in *num* .
mk commenced the military struggle against apartheid with acts of sabotage aimed at the installations of the state , and in the early stages was reluctant to target civilian targets .
mk was responsible for the deaths of both civilians and members of the military .
acts committed by mk include the church street bombing , the magoo's bar bombing and bombing a branch of the standard bank in roodepoort .
it was integrated into the south african national defence force by *num* .
the anc and its members were officially removed from the us terrorism watch list in *num* .
the anc deems itself a force of national liberation in the post-apartheid era ; it officially defines its agenda as the " national democratic revolution " .
the anc is a member of the socialist international .
it also sets forth the redressing of socio-economic differences stemming from colonial- and apartheid-era policies as a central focus of anc policy .
the national democratic revolution ( ndr ) is described as a process through which the national democratic society ( nds ) is achieved ; a society in which people are intellectually , socially , economically and politically empowered .
the drivers of the ndr are also called the motive forces and are defined as the elements within society that gain from the success of the ndr .
using contour plots or concentric circles the centre represents the elements in society that gain the most out of the success of the ndr .
moving away from the centre results in the reduction of the gains that those elements derive .
it is generally believed that the force that occupies the centre of those concentric circles in countries with low unemployment is the working class while in countries with higher levels of unemployment it is the unemployed .
some of the many theoreticians that have written about the ndr include joe slovo , joel netshitenzhe and tshilidzi marwala .
in *num* , the anc declared itself to be a social democratic party .
the *ord* national conference of the anc , held in *num* , stated in its " discussion document " that " china economic development trajectory remains a leading example of the triumph of humanity over adversity .
the exemplary role of the collective leadership of the communist party of china in this regard should be a guiding lodestar of our own struggle .
" it went on to state that " the collapse of the berlin wall and socialism in the soviet union and eastern european states influenced our transition towards the negotiated political settlement in our country .
the cause of events in the world changed tremendously in favour of the us led imperialism .
" the anc holds a historic alliance with the south african communist party ( sacp ) and congress of south african trade unions ( cosatu ) , known as the " tripartite alliance " .
the sacp and cosatu have not contested any election in south africa , but field candidates through the anc , hold senior positions in the anc , and influence party policy and dialogue .
during mbeki's presidency , the government took a more pro-capitalist stance , often running counter to the demands of the sacp and cosatu .
following zuma's accession to the anc leadership in *num* and mbeki's resignation as president in *num* , a number of former anc leaders led by mosiuoa lekota split away from the anc to form the congress of the people .
on *num* december *num* , a special congress of the national union of metalworkers of south africa ( numsa ) , the country's biggest trade union with *num* , *num* members , voted to withdraw support from the anc and sacp , and form a socialist party to protect the interests of the working class .
numsa secretary general irvin jim condemned the anc and sacp's support for big business and stated : " it is clear that the working class cannot any longer see the anc or the sacp as its class allies in any meaningful sense .
" the anc flag comprises three equal horizontal stripes – black , green and gold .
black symbolises the native people of south africa , green represents the land and gold represents the mineral and other natural wealth of south africa .
this flag was also the battle flag of umkhonto we sizwe .
the grand duchy of saxe-weimar-eisenach used an unrelated but identical flag from *num* to *num* .
the black , green and gold tricolor was also used on the flag of the kwazulu bantustan .
although the colours of the new national flag of south africa since the transition from apartheid in *num* have no official meaning , the three colours of the anc flag were included in it , together with red , white and blue .
politicians in the party win a place in parliament by being on the " party list " , which is drawn up before the elections and enumerates , in order , the party's preferred mps .
the number of seats allocated is proportional to the popular national vote , and this determines the cut-off point .
the anc has also gained members through the controversial floor crossing process .
although most south african parties announced their candidate list for provincial premierships in the *num* election , the anc did not , as it is not required for parties to do so .
in *num* , the anc launched an online weekly web-based newsletter , " anc today – online voice of the african national congress " to offset the alleged bias of the press .
it consists mainly of updates on current programmes and initiatives of the anc .

initially intelligence agents of the national party met in secret with anc leaders , including nelson mandela , to judge whether conflict resolution was possible .
discussions and negotiations took place leading to the eventual unbanning of the anc and other opposing political parties by then president de klerk on *num* february *num* .
the next official step towards rebuilding south africa was the groote schuur minute where the government and the anc agreed on a common commitment towards the resolution of the existing climate of violence and intimidation , as well as a commitment to stability and to a peaceful process of negotiations .
the anc negotiated the release of political prisoners and the indemnity from prosecution for returning exiles and moreover channels of communication were established between the government and the anc .
later the pretoria minute represented another step towards resolution where agreements at groote schuur were reconsolidated and steps towards setting up an interim government and drafting a new constitution were established as well as suspension of the military wing of the anc – the umkhonto we sizwe .
this step helped end much of the violence within south africa .
another agreement that came out of the pretoria minute was that both parties would try and raise awareness that a new way of governance was being created for south africa , and that further violence would only hinder this process .
however , violence still continued in kwazulu-natal , which violated the trust between mandela and de klerk .
moreover , internal disputes in the anc prolonged the war as consensus on peace was not reached .
the next significant steps towards resolution were the repeal of the population registration act , the repeal of the group areas and the native land acts and a catch-all abolition of racially based land measures act was passed .
these measures ensured no one could claim , or be deprived of , any land rights on the basis of race .
in december *num* the convention for a democratic south africa ( codesa ) was held with the aim of establishing an interim government .
however , a few months later in june *num* the boipatong massacre occurred and all negotiations crumbled as the anc pulled out .
after this negotiations proceeded between two agents , cyril ramaphosa of the anc , and roelf meyer of the national party .
in over *num* sessions the two men discussed and negotiated over many issues including the nature of the future political system , the fate of over *num* , *num* government employees and if / how the country would be divided .
the result of these negotiations was an interim constitution that meant the transition from apartheid to democracy was a constitutional continuation and that the rule of law and state sovereignty remained intact during the transition , which was vital for stability within the country .
a date was set for the first democratic elections on *num* april *num* .
the anc won *num* .
*num* % of the votes and has been in power ever since .
the most prominent corruption case involving the anc relates to a series of bribes paid to companies involved in the ongoing r55 billion arms deal saga , which resulted in a long term jail sentence to then deputy president jacob zuma's legal adviser schabir shaik .
zuma , the former south african president , was charged with fraud , bribery and corruption in the arms deal , but the charges were subsequently withdrawn by the national prosecuting authority of south africa due to their delay in prosecution .
the anc has also been criticised for its subsequent abolition of the scorpions , the multidisciplinary agency that investigated and prosecuted organised crime and corruption , and was heavily involved in the investigation into zuma and shaik .
tony yengeni , in his position as chief whip of the anc and head of the parliaments defence committee has recently been named as being involved in bribing the german company thyssenkrupp over the purchase of four corvettes for the sandf .
other recent corruption issues include the sexual misconduct and criminal charges of beaufort west municipal manager truman prince , and the oilgate scandal , in which millions of rand in funds from a state-owned company were funnelled into anc coffers .
the anc has also been accused of using government and civil society to fight its political battles against opposition parties such as the democratic alliance .
the result has been a number of complaints and allegations that none of the political parties truly represent the interests of the poor .
this has resulted in the " no land ! no house ! no vote ! " campaign which became very prominent during elections .
in *num* , the " new york times " reported on the killings of anc corruption whistleblowers .
in late *num* the anc was heavily criticised over the passage of the protection of state information bill , which opponents claimed would improperly restrict the freedom of the press .
opposition to the bill included otherwise anc-aligned groups such as cosatu .
notably , nelson mandela and other nobel laureates nadine gordimer , archbishop desmond tutu , and f .
w .
de klerk have expressed disappointment with the bill for not meeting standards of constitutionality and aspirations for freedom of information and expression .
the anc have been criticised for its role in failing to prevent *num* august *num* massacre of lonmin miners at marikana in the north west .
some allege that police commissioner riah phiyega and police minister nathi mthethwa , a close confidant of jacob zuma , may have given the go ahead for the police action against the miners on that day .
commissioner phiyega of the anc came under further criticism as being insensitive and uncaring when she was caught smiling and laughing during the farlam commission's video playback of the ' massacre ' .
archbishop desmond tutu has announced that he no longer can bring himself to exercise a vote for the anc as it is no longer the party that he and nelson mandela fought for , and that the party has now lost its way , and is in danger of becoming a corrupt entity in power .
the anc has a growing list of constitutional failures .
one of the most prominent relates to president of the anc and of the republic , jacob zuma , and his nkandla homestead's security upgrades , valued at around r250 million .
his swimming pool , for example , was termed a ' fire pool ' and his amphitheatre an ' emergency meeting point ' , thus leaving the taxpayer to carry the costs .
after the public protector released her report ( secure in comfort ) which found that zuma must pay back the money spent on the non-security features , he refused to do so .
in *num* the constitutional court ruled that zuma , as well as the national assembly , had " breached the constitution " and failed to uphold it .
zuma apologised to the nation as follows : “the matter has caused a lot of frustration and confusion for which i apologise on my behalf and on behalf of government .
” however he claimed not to have asked nor known about the non-security upgrades , despite the media reporting on them almost daily .
there is also a growing trend for anc members as well as those individuals appointed by the anc to public positions of power to misrepresent their qualifications .
the result of such lies typically lead to those appointed being unable to fulfill their obligations while being paid very large salaries , and typically cost the taxpayer large amount of money while attempting to defend themselves in court .
a small selection follows : carl niehaus , who served as anc speaker , claimed to have a b .
a .
, masters and doctorate degrees ; in reality he never received the masters or doctoral degrees .
pallo jordan , who served as minister of arts and culture claimed to be in possession of a phd , when in reality he has no tertiary education at all .
daniel mtimkulu , who was employed as chief engineer at passenger rail agency of south africa ( prasa ) claimed to have a phd in engineering , which was a lie ; he was merely qualified as an engineering technician .
under mtimkulu's leadership , prasa ordered *num* new locomotives , valued at r3 .
*num* billion .
the first *num* afro *num* diesel locomotives to arrive , at a cost of r600 million , were too tall to be of use on their intended routes .
ellen tshabalala , former chairperson of the south african broadcasting corporation ( sabc ) , claimed to have a bcomm degree .
in reality her marks were so poor ( *num* % for one module and *num* % for another , amongst others ) that she was not allowed to rewrite some of her exams .
she later claimed that he degree certificate was stolen .
defending tshabalala in court cost the sabc more than r1 million .
hlaudi motsoeneng , former coo of the sabc lied about being in possession of a matric certificate .
by his own admission , he simply invented marks for himself .
he was appointed by ellen tshabalala , and his various court cases have cost the sabc more than r1 .
*num* million .
further , under motsoeneng's reign , the broadcaster recorded a net loss of r411 million in the *num* / *num* financial year .
dudu myeni , chairperson of south african airways ( saa ) and good friend of jacob zuma , claimed to have a bachelor's degree in administration .
this was proven false .
under her leadership " saa’s losses for the *num* / *num* financial year were r5 .
6-billion – close to r1-billion more than the expected amount of r4 .
7-billion " .
sicelo shiceka , minister of cooperative governance and traditional affairs lied about being in possession of a master's degree .
he used taxpayer's money to fund a party for his mother and secured a government car for his girlfriend , whereafter he was appointed as a member of the inter-ministerial task team on corruption .
a *num* statement issued by zizi kodwa , the anc national spokesperson states that " [ t ] he anc rejects these [ racist ] comments with the contempt they deserve and calls on all south africans to join in the rejection of all racists in our country , wherever they are .
it is sad that well meaning south africans have to contend with this backward attitude .
" in support of this statement , the anc has publicly called for legal action to be taken against whites who have publicly made racist comments against blacks , usually through social media .
penny sparrow is one such high-profile case .
she posted the following through her facebook account : these monkeys that are allowed to be released on new year’s eve and new year’s day on to public beaches towns etc obviously have no education what so ever so to allow them loose is inviting huge dirt and troubles and discomfort to others .
i’m sorry to say that i was among the revellers and all i saw were black on black skins what a shame .
i do know some wonderful and thoughtful black people .
this lot of monkeys just don’t want to even try .
but think they can voice opinions about statute and get their way oh dear .
from now i shall address the blacks of south africa as monkeys as i see the cute little wild monkeys do the same , pick drop and litter .
sparrow pleaded guilty to crimen injuria , and was presented with a choice of either paying a r5 , *num* fine or *num* months in jail , in addition to paying the legal fees incurred by the anc , who brought the matter to court .
in a separate instance , she was also ordered to pay r150 , *num* to the oliver and adelaide tambo trust .
in contrast to the anc's swift and decisive action towards sparrow and other white racists , they have mostly ignored racist comments voiced by blacks , in particular anc members .
for example , kenny barrel nkosi , an anc ward councillor ( govan mbeki municipality , mpumalanga ) posted the following on his facebook account : " the first people that need to fokkof [ fuck off ] are whites , cubans never oppressed us .
these are our true friends they were there in the times on needs .
welcom cdes welcome [ sic ] " the municipality issued the following statement : “the matter has been investigated and at the time of the comment , the ward councillor was not representing the views of either the anc or the govan mbeki municipality , but merely as a personal opinion .
” no further action was taken .
at a gupta family wedding held at sun city in *num* , various incidents of racism occurred .
the family made clear that they wanted only white workers , including waiters , security , bar staff and cleaning staff .
black workers were told to wash before they interacted with guests .
these allegations were denied by the gupta family .
nonetheless , in the gupta e-mail leak of *num* these allegations were shown to be correct .
moreover , the e-mails also make clear that a black worker was called a monkey by a member of the gupta family .
that the gupta family is a large , vocal and powerful supporter of the anc and a personal friend of jacob zuma , may explain why no action was taken against them with regards to racism .
lindiwe sisulu , anc member and minister of defence and military veterans ( who demanded that the estate agency affairs board report to her regarding action taken against sparrow ) called the democratic alliance leader , mmusi maimane , a " hired native " .
ironically – due to the fact that chris hart , prominent economist and investment strategist at standard bank , was forced to resign for his racist tweet stating that " [ m ] ore than *num* years after apartheid ended , the victims are increasing along with a sense of entitlement and hatred towards minorities… .
" – sisulu said the following , while discussing the *num* .
*num* million housing backlog : " what makes an 18-year-old think the state owes them a house ? it’s a culture of entitlement … we can’t continue with a dependency culture .
" no action has been taken against sisulu .
lulu xingwana , former anc minister of women , children and people with disabilities , stated that " [ y ] oung afrikaner men are brought up in the calvinist religion believing that they own a woman , they own a child , they own everything and therefore they can take that life because they own it " .
the minister apologised , and no further action was taken against her .
jimmy manyi , anc director general of labour and later anc spokesperson , is quotes as saying the following on a tv interview : “i think its very important for coloured people in this country to understand that south africa belongs to them in totality , not just the western cape .
so this over-concentration of coloureds in the western cape is not working for them .
they should spread in the rest of the country .
.
.
so they must stop this over-concentration situation because they are in over-supply where they are so you must look into the country and see where you can meet the supply .
" no action has been taken against manyi .
julius malema , former ancyl leader and current eff leader , stated at a political rally in *num* that “we [ the eff ] are not calling for the slaughter of white people‚ at least for now " .
when asked for comment by a news agency , the anc spokesperson , zizi kodwa stated that there will be no comment from the anc , as " [ h ] e [ malema ] was addressing his own party supporters .
" while still the ancyl leader , malema was taken to the equality court by afriforum for repeatedly singing “dubul’ ibhunu” , which translate as “shoot the boer [ white farmer ] ” .
the anc supported malema , though afriforum and the anc reached a settlement before the appeal case was due to be argued in the supreme court of appeal .
in partial response to the penny sparrow case , velaphi khumalo , while working for the department of sport , arts , culture and recreation , posted the following on his facebook account : " i want to cleans this country of all white people .
we must act as hitler did to the jews .
i don't believe any more that the is a large number of not so racist whit people .
i'm starting to be sceptical even of those within our movement the anc .
i will from today unfriend all white people i have as friends from today u must be put under the same blanket as any other racist white because secretly u all are a bunch of racist fuck heads .
as we have already seen [ all sic ] .
" he also posted : " noo seriously though u oppressed us when u were a minority and then manje u call us monkeys and we supposed to let it slide .
white people in south africa deserve to be hacked and killed like jews .
u have the same venom moss .
look at palestine .
noo u must be bushed alive and skinned and your off springs used as garden fertiliser [ all sic ] " .
the department of sports , arts , culture and recreation responded with a statement wherein it " views the hateful post by velaphi khumalo in a serious light .
our key mandate is nation-building and social cohesion .
his sentiments take our country backwards and do not reflect what the gauteng provincial government stands for .
” khumalo was suspended on full pay while an investigation was undertaken , was found to be guilty by an internal disciplinary procedure , and issued with a warning , whereafter he resumed his work at the department .
esethu hasane , media and communication manager for the department of sport and recreation tweeted the following during the severe droughts in the western cape in *num* : " only western cape still has dry dams .
please god , we have black people there , choose another way of punishing white people .
" despite calls for his dismissal , no action was taken .
cites cites ( the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora , also known as the washington convention ) is a multilateral treaty to protect endangered plants and animals .
it was drafted as a result of a resolution adopted in *num* at a meeting of members of the international union for conservation of nature ( iucn ) .
the convention was opened for signature in *num* and cites entered into force on *num* july *num* .
its aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten the survival of the species in the wild , and it accords varying degrees of protection to more than *num* , *num* species of animals and plants .
in order to ensure that the general agreement on tariffs and trade ( gatt ) was not violated , the secretariat of gatt was consulted during the drafting process .
, secretary-general of the cites secretariat is ivonne higuero .
cites is one of the largest and oldest conservation and sustainable use agreements in existence .
participation is voluntary , and countries that have agreed to be bound by the convention are known as parties .
although cites is legally binding on the parties , it does not take the place of national laws .
rather it provides a framework respected by each party , which must adopt their own domestic legislation to implement cites at the national level .
often , domestic legislation is either non-existent ( especially in parties that have not ratified it ) , or with penalties with the gravity of the crime and insufficient deterrents to wildlife traders .
as of *num* , *num* % of parties lacked one or more of the four major requirements for a party : designation of management and scientific authorities ; laws prohibiting the trade in violation of cites ; penalties for such trade ; laws providing for the confiscation of specimens .
funding for the activities of the secretariat and conference of the parties ( cop ) meetings comes from a trust fund derived from party contributions .
trust fund money is not available to parties to improve implementation or compliance .
these activities , and all those outside secretariat activities ( training , species specific programmes such as monitoring the illegal killing of elephants - mike ) must find external funding , mostly from donor countries and regional organizations such as the european union .
although the convention itself does not provide for arbitration or dispute in the case of noncompliance , *num* years of cites in practice has resulted in several strategies to deal with infractions by parties .
the secretariat , when informed of an infraction by a party , will notify all other parties .
the secretariat will give the party time to respond to the allegations and may provide technical assistance to prevent further infractions .
other actions the convention itself does not provide for but that derive from subsequent cop resolutions may be taken against the offending party .
these include : bilateral sanctions have been imposed on the basis of national legislation ( e .
g .
the usa used certification under the pelly amendment to get japan to revoke its reservation to hawksbill turtle products in *num* , thus reducing the volume of its exports ) .
infractions may include negligence with respect to permit issuing , excessive trade , lax enforcement , and failing to produce annual reports ( the most common ) .
originally , cites addressed depletion resulting from demand for luxury goods such as furs in western countries , but with the rising wealth of asia , particularly in china , the focus changed to products demanded there , particularly those used for luxury goods such as ivory or shark fins or for superstitious purposes such as rhinoceros horn .
as of *num* the demand was massive and had expanded to include thousands of species previously considered unremarkable and in no danger of extinction such as manta rays or pangolins .
the text of the convention was finalized at a meeting of representatives of *num* countries in washington , d .
c .
, united states , on *num* march *num* .
it was then open for signature until *num* december *num* .
it entered into force after the *ord* ratification by a signatory country , on *num* july *num* .
countries that signed the convention become parties by ratifying , accepting or approving it .
by the end of *num* , all signatory countries had become parties .
states that were not signatories may become parties by acceding to the convention .
as of october *num* , the convention has *num* parties , including *num* states and the european union .
the cites convention includes provisions and rules for trade with non-parties .
all member states of the united nations are party to the treaty , with the exception of andorra , democratic people's republic of korea , federated states of micronesia , haiti , kiribati , marshall islands , nauru , south sudan , east timor , tonga , turkmenistan , and tuvalu .
un observer the holy see is also not a member .
the faroe islands , an autonomous country in the kingdom of denmark , is also treated as a non-party to cites ( both the danish mainland and greenland are part of cites ) .
an amendment to the text of the convention , known as the gaborone amendment allows regional economic integration organizations ( reio ) , such as the european union , to have the status of a member state and to be a party to the convention .
the reio can vote at cites meetings with the number of votes representing the number of members in the reio , but it does not have an additional vote .
in accordance with article xvii , paragraph *num* , of the cites convention , the gaborone amendment entered into force on *num* november *num* , *num* days after *num* ( two-thirds ) of the *num* states that were party to cites on *num* april *num* deposited their instrument of acceptance of the amendment .
at that time it entered into force only for those states that had accepted the amendment .
the amended text of the convention will apply automatically to any state that becomes a party after *num* november *num* .
for states that became party to the convention before that date and have not accepted the amendment , it will enter into force *num* days after they accept it .
cites works by subjecting international trade in specimens of selected species to certain controls .
all import , export , re-export and introduction from the sea of species covered by the convention has to be authorized through a licensing system .
according to article ix of the convention , management and scientific authorities , each party to the convention must designate one or more management authorities in charge of administering that licensing system and one or more scientific authorities to advise them on the effects of trade on the status of cites-listed species .
roughly *num* , *num* species of animals and *num* , *num* species of plants are protected by cites against over-exploitation through international trade .
each protected species or population is included in one of three lists , called appendices ( explained below ) .
the appendix that lists a species or population reflects the extent of the threat to it and the controls that apply to the trade .
species may be split-listed meaning that some populations of a species are on one appendix , while some are on another .
some people argue that this is risky as specimens from a more protected population could be ' laundered ' through the borders of a party whose population is not as strictly protected .
the african bush elephant ( " loxodonta africana " ) is currently split-listed , with all populations except those of botswana , namibia , south africa and zimbabwe listed in appendix i .
those of botswana , namibia , south africa and zimbabwe are listed in appendix ii .
listing the species over the whole of its range would prevent such ' laundering ' but also restricts trade in wildlife products by range states with good management practices .
there are also species that have only some populations listed in an appendix .
one example is the pronghorn ( " antilocapra americana " ) , a ruminant native to north america .
its mexican population is listed in appendix i , but its u .
s .
and canadian populations are not listed ( though certain u .
s .
populations in arizona are nonetheless protected under the endangered species act ) .
species are proposed for inclusion in or deletion from the appendices at meetings of the conference of the parties ( cop ) , which are held approximately once every three years , the most recent of which was cop ( cop *num* ) in johannesburg , south africa from *num* september to *num* october *num* at the sandton convention center .
species in the appendices may be proposed for addition , change of appendix , or de-listing ( i .
e .
, deletion ) by any party , whether or not it is a range state and changes may be made despite objections by range states if there is sufficient ( *num* / *num* majority ) support for the listing .
these discussions are usually among the most contentious at cop meetings .
there has been increasing willingness within the parties to allow for trade in products from well-managed populations .
for instance , sales of the south african white rhino have generated revenues that helped pay for protection .
listing the species on appendix i increased the price of rhino horn ( which fueled more poaching ) , but the species survived wherever there was adequate on-the-ground protection .
thus field protection may be the primary mechanism that saved the population , but it is likely that field protection would not have been increased without cites protection .
appendix i , about *num* species , are species that are threatened with extinction and are or may be affected by trade .
commercial trade in wild-caught specimens of these species is illegal ( permitted only in exceptional licensed circumstances ) .
captive-bred animals or cultivated plants of appendix i species are considered appendix ii specimens , with concomitant requirements ( see below and article vii ) .
the scientific authority of the exporting country must make a non-detriment finding , assuring that export of the individuals will not adversely affect the wild population .
any trade in these species requires export and import permits .
the management authority of the exporting state is expected to check that an import permit has been secured and that the importing state is able to care for the specimen adequately .
notable animal species listed in appendix i include the red panda ( " ailurus fulgens " ) , western gorilla ( " gorilla gorilla " ) , the chimpanzee species ( " pan spp .
" ) , tigers ( " panthera tigris " subspecies ) , asiatic lion ( " panthera leo persica " ) , leopards ( " panthera pardus " ) , jaguar ( " panthera onca " ) , cheetah ( " acinonyx jubatus " ) , asian elephant ( " elephas maximus " ) , some populations of african bush elephant ( " loxodonta africana " ) , the dugong and manatees ( sirenia ) , and all rhinoceros species ( except some southern african subspecies populations ) .
appendix ii , about *num* , *num* species , are species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction , but may become so unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation in order to avoid utilization incompatible with the survival of the species in the wild .
in addition , appendix ii can include species similar in appearance to species already listed in the appendices .
international trade in specimens of appendix ii species may be authorized by the granting of an export permit or re-export certificate .
in practice , many hundreds of thousands of appendix ii animals are traded annually .
no import permit is necessary for these species under cites , although some parties do require import permits as part of their stricter domestic measures .
a non-detriment finding and export permit are required by the exporting party .
in addition , article vii of cites states that specimens of animals listed in appendix i that are bred in captivity for commercial purposes are treated as appendix ii .
the same applies for specimens of appendix i plants artificially propagated for commercial purposes .
examples of species listed on appendix ii are the great white shark ( " carcharodon carcharias " ) , the american black bear ( " ursus americanus " ) , hartmann's mountain zebra ( " equus zebra hartmannae " ) , green iguana ( " iguana iguana " ) , queen conch ( " strombus gigas " ) , emperor scorpion ( " pandinus imperator " ) , mertens ' water monitor ( " varanus mertensi " ) , bigleaf mahogany ( " swietenia macrophylla " ) and lignum vitae " ironwood " ( " guaiacum officinale " ) .
appendix iii , about *num* species , are species that are listed after one member country has asked other cites parties for assistance in controlling trade in a species .
the species are not necessarily threatened with extinction globally .
in all member countries , trade in these species is only permitted with an appropriate export permit and a certificate of origin from the state of the member country who has listed the species .
examples of species listed on appendix iii and the countries that listed them are the two-toed sloth ( " choloepus hoffmanni " ) by costa rica , sitatunga ( tragelaphus spekii ) by ghana , african civet ( " civettictis civetta " ) by botswana , and alligator snapping turtle by the usa .
amendments to the convention must be supported by a two-thirds majority who are " present and voting " and can be made during an extraordinary meeting of the cop if one-third of the parties are interested in such a meeting .
the gaborone amendment ( *num* ) allows regional economic blocs to accede to the treaty .
reservations ( article xxiii ) can be made by any party with respect to any species , which considerably weakens the treaty ( see for current reservations ) .
trade with non-party states is allowed , although permits and certificates are recommended to be issued by exporters and sought by importers .
notable reservations include those by iceland , japan and norway on various baleen whale species and those on falconiformes by saudi arabia .
general limitations about the structure and philosophy of cites include : by design and intent it focuses on trade at the species level and does not address habitat loss , ecosystem approaches to conservation , or poverty ; it seeks to prevent unsustainable use rather than promote sustainable use ( which generally conflicts with the convention on biological diversity ) , although this has been changing ( see nile crocodile , african elephant , south african white rhino case studies in hutton and dickinson *num* ) .
it does not explicitly address market demand .
funding does not provide for increased on-the-ground enforcement ( it must apply for bilateral aid for most projects of this nature ) .
by design , cites regulates and monitors trade in the manner of a " negative list " such that trade in all species is permitted and unregulated " unless " the species in question appears on the appendices or looks very much like one of those taxa .
then and only then , trade is regulated or constrained .
because the remit of the convention covers millions of species of plants and animals , and tens of thousands of these taxa are potentially of economic value , in practice this negative list approach effectively forces cites signatories to expend limited resources on just a select few , leaving many species to be traded with neither constraint nor review .
for example , recently several bird classified as threatened with extinction appeared in the legal wild bird trade because the cites process never considered their status .
if a " positive list " approach were taken , only species evaluated and approved for the positive list would be permitted in trade , thus lightening the review burden for member states and the secretariat , and also preventing inadvertent legal trade threats to poorly known species .
specific weaknesses in the text include : it does not stipulate guidelines for the ' non-detriment ' finding required of national scientific authorities ; non-detriment findings require copious amounts of information ; the ' household effects ' clause is often not rigid enough / specific enough to prevent cites violations by means of this article ( vii ) ; non-reporting from parties means secretariat monitoring is incomplete ; and it has no capacity to address domestic trade in listed species .
suggestions for improvement in the operation of cites include : more regular missions by the secretariat ( not reserved just for high-profile species ) ; improvement of national legislation and enforcement ; better reporting by parties ( and the consolidation of information from all sources-ngos , traffic , the wildlife trade monitoring network and parties ) ; more emphasis on enforcement-including a technical committee enforcement officer ; the development of cites action plans ( akin to biodiversity action plans related to the convention on biological diversity ) including : designation of scientific / management authorities and national enforcement strategies ; incentives for reporting and timelines for both action plans and reporting .
cites would benefit from access to global environment facility ( gef ) , funds-although this is difficult given the gefs more ecosystem approach-or other more regular funds .
development of a future mechanism similar to that of the montreal protocol ( developed nations contribute to a fund for developing nations ) could allow more funds for non-secretariat activities .
on *num* july *num* , the committee of environmental insecticides that oversees the administration of the convention between meetings of all the parties granted china and japan permission to import elephant ivory from four african government stockpiles , the ivory being sold at a single auction in each country .
the amounts to be sold comprise approximately *num* tons from botswana , *num* tons from namibia , *num* tons from south africa , and *num* tons from zimbabwe .
the chinese government in *num* acknowledged that it had lost track of *num* tons of ivory between *num* and *num* .
from *num* – *num* the legal trade corresponded with these numbers in the 1990s the annual trade of legal animal products was $160 billion annually .
in *num* the estimated value almost doubled to $300 billion .
the conference of the parties ( cop ) is held once every two years .
the last conference of the parties ( cop *num* ) was held in johannesburg , south africa , and the one before it ( cop *num* ) was held in bangkok , thailand , in *num* .
the next one ( cop *num* ) will be in sri lanka in *num* .
the location of the next cop is chosen at the close of each cop by a secret ballot vote .
the cites committees ( animals committee , plants committee and standing committee ) hold meetings during each year that does not have a cop , while the standing committee meets also in years with a cop .
the committee meetings take place in geneva , switzerland ( where the secretariat of the cites convention is located ) , unless another country offers to host the meeting .
the animals and plants committees have sometimes held joint meetings .
the previous joint meeting was held in march *num* in dublin , ireland , and the latest one was held in veracruz , mexico in may *num* .

the bush ( alaska ) in alaska , the bush typically refers to any region of the state not connected to the north american road network or ready access to the state's ferry system .
a large proportion of alaska's native populations live in the bush , often substantially depending on subsistence hunting and fishing .
geographically , the bush comprises the alaska north slope ; northwest arctic ; west , including the baldwin and seward peninsulas ; the yukon-kuskokwim delta ; southwest alaska ; bristol bay ; alaska peninsula ; and remote areas of the alaska panhandle and interior .
some of the larger , hub communities in the bush , which typically can be reached by larger , commercial airplanes , include bethel , dillingham , king salmon , nome , utqiagvik , kodiak island , kotzebue , and unalaska-dutch harbor .
most parts of alaska that are off the road or ferry system can be reached by small bush airplanes .
travel between smaller communities or to and from hub communities is typically accomplished by snow machines , boats , or atvs .
batman ( *num* film ) batman is a *num* american superhero film directed by tim burton and produced by jon peters and peter guber , based on the dc comics character of the same name .
it is the first installment of warner bros .
' initial " batman " film series .
the film stars michael keaton as bruce wayne / batman , alongside jack nicholson , kim basinger , robert wuhl , pat hingle , billy dee williams , michael gough and jack palance .
the film takes place early in the title character's war on crime , and depicts a battle with his nemesis the joker .
after burton was hired as director in *num* , steve englehart and julie hickson wrote film treatments before sam hamm wrote the first screenplay .
" batman " was not greenlit until after the success of burton's " beetlejuice " ( *num* ) .
numerous a-list actors were considered for the role of batman before keaton was cast .
keaton's casting caused a controversy since , by *num* , he had become typecast as a comedic actor and many observers doubted he could portray a serious role .
nicholson accepted the role of the joker under strict conditions that dictated top billing , a high salary , a portion of the box office profits and his shooting schedule .
the tone and themes of the film were influenced in part by alan moore and brian bolland's " " and frank miller's " the dark knight returns " .
the film primarily adapts the " red hood " origin story for the joker , in which batman creates the joker by dropping him into axis chemical acid , resulting in his transformation into a psychopath , but it adds a unique twist in presenting him specifically as a gangster named jack napier .
filming took place at pinewood studios from october *num* to january *num* .
the budget escalated from $30 million to $48 million , while the *num* writers guild of america strike forced hamm to drop out .
warren skaaren did rewrites .
additional uncredited drafts were done by charles mckeown and jonathan gems .
"batman " was a critical and financial success , earning over $400 million in box office totals .
it was the fifth-highest-grossing film in history at the time of its release .
the film received several saturn award nominations and a golden globe nomination , and won an academy award .
it also inspired the equally successful " " , paving the way for the dc animated universe , and has influenced hollywood's modern marketing and development techniques of the superhero film genre .
three sequels , " batman returns " , " batman forever " and " batman & robin " , were released on june *num* , *num* , june *num* , *num* , and june *num* , *num* , respectively .
as gotham city approaches its bicentennial , mayor borg orders district attorney harvey dent and police commissioner james gordon to make the city safer .
meanwhile , reporter alexander knox and photojournalist vicki vale begin to investigate rumors of a vigilante nicknamed " batman " who is targeting the city's criminals .
batman's alter-ego is bruce wayne , a billionaire industrialist who , as a child , witnessed his parents ' murder at the hands of a psychotic mugger .
at a fundraiser for the bicentennial in wayne manor , bruce meets and falls for vale , and the two begin a romantic relationship .
however , the evening is cut short as bruce is alerted to commissioner gordon's sudden departure due to police business and leaves to investigate as batman .
mob boss carl grissom , who has already been targeted by dent and gordon , discovers his mistress alicia is involved with his second-in-command jack napier .
with the help of corrupt police lieutenant max eckhardt , grissom engineers napier's death in a raid at axis chemicals .
however , grissom's plan is foiled with the sudden arrival of commissioner gordon , who wants napier captured alive .
in the ensuing shootout , napier , who has realized he was set up , kills eckhardt .
batman arrives and , in a struggle , napier is knocked into a vat of chemicals .
batman escapes and napier is presumed dead .
napier emerges from the vat , but is left disfigured with chalk white skin , emerald green hair , and a rictus grin .
the sociopathic napier is driven insane by the incident and begins calling himself " the joker " .
he kills grissom and usurps authority over his criminal empire , and scars alicia's face to equal his disfigurement .
the joker terrorizes gotham city by lacing hygiene products with " smylex " , a deadly chemical which causes victims to die laughing with the same maniacal grin as the joker .
as he searches for information on batman ( whom he blames for his disfigurement ) , the joker also becomes obsessed with vale .
he lures her to the gotham museum of art and his henchmen destroy the works of art .
batman arrives and rescues her .
they escape in the batmobile , pursued by the joker's men .
batman takes vicki to the batcave , where he gives her information from his research on smylex that will allow the city's residents to avoid exposure to the toxin .
bruce visits vicki at her apartment , prepared to tell her about his alter-ego .
the joker interrupts their meeting , asking bruce , " you ever danced with the devil by the pale moonlight ? " before shooting him .
bruce uses a bended serving tray as body armor and plays dead .
he remembers that the mugger who killed his parents asked the same question , and realizes that napier was his parents ' killer .
vicki is brought to the batcave by bruce's butler , alfred pennyworth , who has been coaxing their relationship because vicki brings out bruce's human side .
after telling her that he cannot focus on their relationship with the joker terrorizing gotham , bruce departs as batman to destroy the axis plant .
meanwhile , the joker lures the citizens of gotham to a parade with the promise of free money , but while throwing cash at the crowd as promised , also attacks them with smylex gas released from his giant parade balloons .
batman arrives and tows the balloons above the clouds with the batwing .
the joker shoots the batwing using a long-barreled gun , causing it to crash , and takes vicki to the top of a cathedral .
batman , who survived the crash , fends off the joker's remaining men despite his injuries , and confronts the joker .
the two fight , with joker eventually gaining the upper hand , leaving batman and vicki clinging onto an outcropping .
the joker tries to escape by helicopter , but batman attaches a heavy granite gargoyle to the joker's leg with his grappling hook , causing him to lose his grip and fall to his death after it breaks off .
commissioner gordon announces that the police have arrested the joker's men and unveils the bat-signal .
harvey dent reads a note from batman , promising that he will defend gotham whenever crime strikes again .
vicki is taken to wayne manor by alfred , who tells her that bruce will be a little late .
she responds that she is not surprised , as batman looks at the signal's projection from a rooftop , standing watch over the city .
in the late 1970s , batman's popularity was waning .
cbs was interested in producing a " batman in outer space " film .
producers benjamin melniker and michael e .
uslan purchased the film rights of batman from dc comics on october *num* , *num* .
it was uslan's wish " to make the definitive , dark , serious version of batman , the way bob kane and bill finger had envisioned him in *num* .
a creature of the night ; stalking criminals in the shadows .
" richard maibaum was approached to write a script with guy hamilton to direct , but the two turned down the offer .
uslan was unsuccessful with pitching " batman " to various movie studios because they wanted the film to be similar to the campy 1960s tv series .
columbia pictures and united artists were among those to turn down the film .
a disappointed uslan then wrote a script titled " return of the batman " to give the film industry a better idea of his vision for the film .
uslan later compared its dark tone to that of " the dark knight returns " , which his script pre-dated by six years .
in november *num* , producers jon peters and peter guber joined the project .
melniker and uslan became executive producers .
the four felt it was best to pattern the film's development after that of " superman " ( *num* ) .
uslan , melniker and guber pitched " batman " to universal pictures , but the studio turned it down .
though no movie studios were yet involved , the project was publicly announced with a budget of $15 million in july *num* at the comic art convention in new york .
warner bros .
, the studio behind the successful superman film franchise , decided to also accept and produce " batman " .
tom mankiewicz completed a script titled " the batman " in june *num* , focusing on batman and dick grayson's origins , with the joker and rupert thorne as villains , and silver st .
cloud as the romantic interest .
mankiewicz took inspiration from the limited series " batman : strange apparitions " , written by steve englehart .
comic book artist marshall rogers , who worked with englehart on " strange apparitions " , was hired for concept art .
" the batman " was then announced in late *num* for a mid-1985 release date on a budget of $20 million .
originally , mankiewicz had wanted an unknown actor for batman , william holden for james gordon , david niven as alfred pennyworth , and peter o'toole as the penguin , whom mankiewicz wanted to portray as a mobster with low body temperature .
holden died in *num* and niven in *num* , so this would never come to pass .
a number of filmmakers were attached to mankiewicz ' script , including ivan reitman and joe dante .
reitman wanted to cast bill murray as batman and eddie murphy as robin .
nine rewrites were performed by nine separate writers .
most of them were based on " strange apparitions " .
however , it was mankiewicz's script that was still being used to guide the project .
after the financial success of " pee-wee's big adventure " ( *num* ) , warner bros .
hired tim burton to direct " batman " .
burton had then-girlfriend julie hickson write a new 30-page film treatment , feeling the previous script by mankiewicz was campy .
the success of " the dark knight returns " and " " rekindled warner bros .
' interest in a film adaptation .
burton was initially not a comic book fan , but he was impressed by the dark and serious tone found in both " the dark knight returns " and " the killing joke " .
warner bros .
enlisted the aid of englehart to write a new treatment in march *num* .
like mankiewicz's script , it was based on his own " strange apparitions " , and included silver st .
cloud , dick grayson , the joker and rupert thorne , as well as a cameo appearance by the penguin .
warner bros .
was impressed , but englehart felt there were too many characters .
he removed the penguin and dick grayson in his second treatment , finishing in may *num* .
burton approached sam hamm , a comic book fan , to write the screenplay .
hamm decided not to use an origin story , feeling that flashbacks would be more suitable and that " unlocking the mystery " would become part of the storyline .
he reasoned , " you totally destroy your credibility if you show the literal process by which bruce wayne becomes batman .
" hamm replaced silver st .
cloud with vicki vale and rupert thorne with his own creation , carl grissom .
he completed his script in october *num* , which demoted dick grayson to a cameo rather than a supporting character .
one scene in hamm's script had a young james gordon on duty the night of the murder of bruce wayne's parents .
when hamm's script was rewritten , the scene was deleted , reducing it to a photo in the " gotham globe " newspaper seen in the film .
warner bros .
was less willing to move forward on development , despite their enthusiasm for hamm's script , which batman co-creator bob kane greeted with positive feedback .
hamm's script was then bootlegged at various comic book stores in the united states .
" batman " was finally given the greenlight to commence pre-production in april *num* , after the success of burton's " beetlejuice " ( *num* ) .
when comic book fans found out about burton directing the film with michael keaton starring in the lead role , controversy arose over the tone and direction " batman " was going in .
hamm explained , " they hear tim burton's name and they think of " pee-wee's big adventure " .
they hear keaton's name and they think of any number of michael keaton comedies .
you think of the 1960s version of " batman " , and it was the complete opposite of our film .
we tried to market it with a typical dark and serious tone , but the fans didn't believe us .
" to combat negative reports on the film's production , kane was hired as creative consultant .
parallel to the " superman " casting , a who's who of hollywood top stars were considered for the role of batman , including mel gibson , kevin costner , charlie sheen , tom selleck , bill murray , harrison ford and dennis quaid .
burton was pressured by warner bros .
to cast an obvious action movie star , and had approached pierce brosnan , but he had no interest in playing a comic book character .
burton was originally interested in casting an unknown actor , and offered ray liotta a chance to audition after having completed " something wild " , but liotta declined , a decision he regrets .
willem dafoe , who was falsely reported to be considered for the joker , had actually been considered for batman early in development .
producer jon peters suggested michael keaton , arguing he had the right " edgy , tormented quality " after having seen his dramatic performance in " clean and sober " .
having directed keaton in " beetlejuice " , burton agreed .
keaton's casting caused a controversy among comic book fans , with *num* , *num* protest letters sent to warner bros .
offices .
bob kane , sam hamm and michael uslan also heavily questioned the casting .
" obviously there was a negative response from the comic book people .
i think they thought we were going to make it like the 1960s tv series , and make it campy , because they thought of michael keaton from " mr .
mom " and " night shift " and stuff like that .
" keaton studied " the dark knight returns " for inspiration .
brad dourif , tim curry , david bowie , john lithgow and james woods were considered for the joker .
lithgow , during his audition , attempted to talk burton out of casting him , a decision he would later publicly regret , stating , " i didn’t realize it was such a big deal " .
burton wanted to cast dourif , but the studio refused .
robin williams lobbied hard for the part .
jack nicholson had been producer michael uslan's and bob kane's choice since *num* .
peters approached nicholson as far back as *num* , during filming of " the witches of eastwick " .
nicholson had what was known as an " off-the-clock " agreement .
his contract specified the number of hours he was entitled to have off each day , from the time he left the set to the time he reported back for filming , as well as being off for los angeles lakers home games .
nicholson demanded to have all of his scenes shot in a three-week block , but the schedule lapsed into *num* days .
he received a $6 million salary , as well as a large percentage of the box office gross estimated between $60 million to $90 million .
sean young was originally cast as vicki vale , but was injured in a horse-riding accident prior to commencement of filming .
young's departure necessitated an urgent search for an actress who , besides being right for the part , could commit to the film at very short notice .
peters suggested kim basinger : she was able to join the production immediately and was cast .
as a fan of michael gough's work in various hammer film productions , burton cast gough as bruce wayne's butler , alfred pennyworth .
robert wuhl was cast as reporter alexander knox .
his character was originally supposed to die by the joker's poison gas in the climax , but the filmmakers " liked [ my ] character so much , " wuhl said , " that they decided to let me live .
" burton chose billy dee williams as harvey dent because he wanted to include the villain two-face in a future film using the concept of an african-american two-face for the black and white concept , but tommy lee jones was later cast in the role for " batman forever " , which disappointed williams .
nicholson convinced the filmmakers to cast his close friend tracey walter as the joker's henchman , bob .
kiefer sutherland was considered as robin before the character was deleted from the shooting script .
the rest of the cast included pat hingle as commissioner gordon , jerry hall as alicia hunt , lee wallace as mayor borg , william hootkins as lt .
max eckhardt , and jack palance as crime boss carl grissom .
the filmmakers considered filming " batman " entirely on the warner bros .
backlot in burbank , california , but media interest in the film made them change the location .
it was shot at pinewood studios in england from october *num* to january *num* .
*num* sound stages were used , almost the entirety of pinewood's 95-acre backlot .
locations included knebworth house and hatfield house doubling for wayne manor , plus acton lane power station and little barford power station .
the original production budget escalated from $30 million to $48 million .
filming was highly secretive .
the unit publicist was offered and refused £10 , *num* for the first pictures of jack nicholson as the joker .
the police were later called in when two reels of footage ( about *num* minutes ' worth ) were stolen .
with various problems during filming , burton called it " torture .
the worst period of my life ! " hamm was not allowed to perform rewrites during the *num* writers guild of america strike .
warren skaaren , who had also worked on burton's " beetlejuice " , did rewrites .
jonathan gems and charles mckeown rewrote the script during filming .
only skaaren received screenplay credit with hamm .
hamm criticized the rewrites , but blamed the changes on warner bros .
burton explained , " i don't understand why that became such a problem .
we started out with a script that everyone liked , although we recognized it needed a little work .
" dick grayson appeared in the shooting script but was deleted , as the filmmakers felt he was irrelevant to the plot .
bob kane supported this decision .
keaton , who called himself a " logic freak " , was concerned that batman's secret identity would in reality be fairly easy to uncover , and discussed ideas with burton to better disguise the character , including the use of contact lenses .
ultimately , keaton decided to perform batman's voice at a lower register than when he was portraying bruce wayne , which became a hallmark of the film version of the character , with christian bale later using the same technique .
originally in the climax , the joker was to kill vicki vale , sending batman into a vengeful fury .
jon peters reworked the climax without telling burton and commissioned production designer anton furst to create a model of the cathedral .
this cost $100 , *num* when the film was already well over budget .
burton disliked the idea , having no clue how the scene would end : " here were jack nicholson and kim basinger walking up this cathedral , and halfway up jack turns around and says , ' why am i walking up all these stairs ? where am i going ? ' ' we'll talk about it when you get to the top ! ' i had to tell him that i didn't know .
" burton was impressed with anton furst's designs in " the company of wolves " , and previously failed to hire furst as production designer for " beetlejuice " .
furst had been too committed on " high spirits " , a choice he later regretted .
furst enjoyed working with burton .
" i don't think i've ever felt so naturally in tune with a director " , he said .
" conceptually , spiritually , visually , or artistically .
there was never any problem because we never fought over anything .
texture , attitude and feelings are what burton is a master at .
" furst and the art department deliberately mixed clashing architectural styles to " make gotham city the ugliest and bleakest metropolis imaginable " .
furst continued , " [ w ] e imagined what new york city might have become without a planning commission .
a city run by crime , with a riot of architectural styles .
an essay in ugliness .
as if hell erupted through the pavement and kept on going " .
the *num* film " brazil " by terry gilliam was also a notable influence upon the film's production design , as both burton and furst studied it as a reference .
derek meddings served as the visual effects supervisor , while keith short helped construct the newly created *num* batmobile , adding two browning machine guns .
on designing the batmobile , furst explained , " we looked at jet aircraft components , we looked at war machines , we looked at all sorts of things .
in the end , we went into pure expressionism , taking the salt flat racers of the 30s and the sting ray macho machines of the 50s " .
the car was built upon a chevrolet impala when previous development with a jaguar and ford mustang failed .
costume designer bob ringwood turned down the chance to work on " licence to kill " in favor of " batman " .
ringwood found it difficult designing the batsuit because " the image of batman in the comics is this huge , big six-foot-four hunk with a dimpled chin .
michael keaton is a guy with average build " , he stated .
" the problem was to make somebody who was average-sized and ordinary-looking into this bigger-than-life creature .
" burton commented , " michael is a bit claustrophobic , which made it worse for him .
the costume put him in a dark , batman-like mood though , so he was able to use it to his advantage " .
burton's idea was to use an all-black suit , and was met with positive feedback by bob kane .
jon peters wanted to use a nike product placement with the batsuit .
ringwood studied over *num* comic book issues for inspiration .
*num* sculpted latex designs were created ; *num* different cape looks and *num* different heads were made , accumulating a total cost of $250 , *num* .
comic book fans initially expressed negative feedback against the batsuit .
burton opted not to use tights , spandex , or underpants as seen in the comic book , feeling it was not intimidating .
prosthetic makeup designer nick dudman used acrylic-based makeup paint called pax for nicholson's chalk-white face .
part of nicholson's contract was approval over the makeup designer .
burton hired danny elfman of oingo boingo , his collaborator on " pee-wee's big adventure " and " beetlejuice " , to compose the music score .
for inspiration , elfman was given " the dark knight returns " .
elfman was worried , as he had never worked on a production this large in budget and scale .
in addition , producer jon peters was skeptical of hiring elfman , but was later convinced when he heard the opening number .
peters and peter guber wanted prince to write music for the joker and michael jackson to do the romance songs .
elfman would then combine the style of prince and jackson's songs together for the entire film score .
burton protested the ideas , citing " my movies aren't commercial like " top gun " .
" elfman enlisted the help of oingo boingo lead guitarist steve bartek and shirley walker to arrange the compositions for the orchestra .
elfman was later displeased with the audio mixing of his film score .
" "batman " was done in england by technicians who didn't care , and the non-caring showed , " he stated .
" i'm not putting down england because they've done gorgeous dubs there , but this particular crew elected not to .
" " batman " was one of the first films to spawn two soundtracks .
one of them featured songs written by prince while the other showcased elfman's score .
both were successful , and compilations of elfman's opening credits were used in the title sequence theme for " " , also composed by shirley walker .
when discussing the central theme of " batman " , director tim burton explained , " the whole film and mythology of the character is a complete duel of the freaks .
it's a fight between two disturbed people " , adding that " the joker is such a great character because there's a complete freedom to him .
any character who operates on the outside of society and is deemed a freak and an outcast then has the freedom to do what they want .
.
.
they are the darker sides of freedom .
insanity is in some scary way the most freedom you can have , because you're not bound by the laws of society " .
burton saw bruce wayne as the bearer of a double identity , exposing one while hiding the reality from the world .
burton biographer ken hanke wrote that bruce wayne , struggling with his alter-ego as batman , is depicted as an antihero .
hanke felt that batman has to push the boundaries of civil justice to deal with certain criminals , such as the joker .
kim newman theorized that " burton and the writers saw batman and the joker as a dramatic antithesis , and the film deals with their intertwined origins and fates to an even greater extent " .
"batman " conveys trademarks found in 1930s pulp magazines , notably the design of gotham city stylized with art deco design .
richard corliss , writing for " time " , observed that gotham's design was a reference to films such as " the cabinet of dr .
caligari " ( *num* ) and " metropolis " ( *num* ) .
" gotham city , despite being shot on a studio backlot " , he continued , " is literally another character in the script .
it has the demeaning presence of german expressionism and fascist architecture , staring down at the citizens .
" hanke further addressed the notions of " batman " being a period piece , in that " the citizens , cops , people and the black-and-white television looks like it takes place in *num* " ; but later said : " had the filmmakers made vicki vale a femme fatale rather than a damsel in distress , this could have made " batman " as a homage and tribute to classic film noir .
" portions of the climax pay homage to " vertigo " ( *num* ) .
production designer anton furst designed the poster , which he called " evocative but ubiquitous .
only featuring the bat-symbol .
not too much and not too little " .
earlier designs " had the word ' batman ' spelled in " robocop " or " conan the barbarian"-type font " .
jon peters unified all the film's tie-ins , even turning down $6 million from general motors to build the batmobile because the car company would not relinquish creative control .
during production , peters read in " the wall street journal " that comic book fans were unsatisfied with the casting of michael keaton .
in response , peters rushed the first film trailer that played in thousands of theaters during christmas .
it was simply an assemblage of scenes without music , but create enormous anticipation for the film .
dc comics allowed screenwriter sam hamm to write his own comic book miniseries .
hamm's stories were collected in the graphic novel " batman : blind justice " ( ) .
denys cowan and dick giordano illustrated the artwork .
" blind justice " tells the story of bruce wayne trying to solve a series of murders connected to wayne enterprises .
it also marks the first appearance of henri ducard , who was later used in the rebooted " batman begins " , albeit as an alias for the more notable ra's al ghul .
in the months before " batman"s release in june *num* , a popular culture phenomenon known as " batmania " began .
over $750 million worth of merchandise was sold .
cult filmmaker and comic book writer kevin smith remembered : " that summer was huge .
you couldn't turn around without seeing the bat-signal somewhere .
people were cutting it into their fucking heads .
it was just the summer of batman and if you were a comic book fan it was pretty hot .
" hachette book group usa published a novelization , " batman " , written by craig shaw gardner .
it remained on the " new york times " best seller list throughout june *num* .
burton admitted he was annoyed by the publicity .
david handelman of " the new york observer " categorized " batman " as a high concept film .
he believed " it is less movie than a corporate behemoth " .
"batman " grossed $2 .
*num* million in late night previews on june *num* , *num* on *num* , *num* screens and grossed $40 .
*num* million in *num* , *num* theaters during its opening weekend .
this broke the opening weekend record , set by " ghostbusters ii " one week earlier , with $29 .
*num* million .
" batman " became the fastest film to earn $100 million , reaching it in *num* days ( *num* days plus late night previews ) , the film closed on december *num* , *num* , with a final gross $251 .
*num* million in north america and $160 .
*num* million internationally , totaling $411 .
*num* million .
and was the highest grossing film based on a dc comic book until 2008's " the dark knight " .
the film's gross is the *ord* highest ever in north american ranks .
although " indiana jones and the last crusade " made the most money worldwide in *num* , " batman " was able to beat " the last crusade " in north america , and made a further $150 million in home video sales .
box office mojo estimates that the film sold more than *num* million tickets in the us .
"batman " was criticized by some for being too dark , but nonetheless received positive reviews from critics .
on rotten tomatoes the film has an approval rating of *num* % based on *num* reviews , with an average rating of *num* .
*num* / *num* .
the site's critical consensus reads , " an eerie , haunting spectacle , " batman " succeeds as dark entertainment , even if jack nicholson's joker too often overshadows the title character .
" metacritic gives an aggregated score of *num* out of *num* , based on *num* critics , indicating " generally favorable reviews " .
audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of " a " on an a+ to f scale .
many observed that burton was more interested in the joker and the art and set production design than batman or anything else in terms of characterization and screentime .
comic book fans reacted negatively over the joker murdering thomas and martha wayne ; in the comic book , joe chill is responsible .
writer sam hamm said it was burton's idea to have the joker murder wayne's parents .
" the writer's strike was going on , and tim had the other writers do that .
i also hold innocent to alfred letting vicki vale into the batcave .
fans were ticked off with that , and i agree .
that would have been alfred's last day of employment at wayne manor , " hamm said .
the songs written by prince were criticized for being " too out of place " .
while burton has stated he had no problem with the prince songs , he was less enthusiastic with their use in the film .
on the film , burton remarked , " i liked parts of it , but the whole movie is mainly boring to me .
it's ok , but it was more of a cultural phenomenon than a great movie .
" despite initial negative reactions from comics fans prior to the film's release , keaton's portrayal of batman was generally praised .
james berardinelli called the film entertaining , with the highlight being the production design .
however , he concluded , " the best thing that can be said about " batman " is that it led to " batman returns " , which was a far superior effort .
" " variety " felt " jack nicholson stole every scene " but still greeted the film with positive feedback .
roger ebert was highly impressed with the production design , but claimed " "batman " is a triumph of design over story , style over substance , a great-looking movie with a plot you can't care much about .
" he also called the film " a depressing experience " .
his reviewing partner gene siskel disagreed , describing the film as having a ' refreshingly adult ' approach with performances , direction and set design that ' draws you into a psychological world ' .
anton furst and peter young won the academy award for best art direction , while nicholson was nominated for the golden globe award for best actor ( musical or comedy ) .
the british academy of film and television arts nominated " batman " in six categories ( production design , visual effects , costume design , makeup , sound and actor in a supporting role for nicholson ) , but it won none of the categories .
nicholson , basinger , the makeup department , and costume designer bob ringwood all received nominations at the saturn awards .
the film was also nominated for the saturn award for best fantasy film and the hugo award for best dramatic presentation .
the success of " batman " prompted warner bros .
animation to create the acclaimed " " , as a result beginning the long-running dc animated universe and helped establish the modern day superhero film genre .
series co-creator bruce timm stated the television show's art deco design was inspired from the film .
timm commented , " our show would never have gotten made if it hadn't been for that first " batman " movie .
" burton joked , " ever since i did " batman " , it was like the first dark comic book movie .
now everyone wants to do a dark and serious superhero movie .
i guess i'm the one responsible for that trend .
" "batman " initiated the original " batman " film series and spawned three sequels : " batman returns " ( *num* ) , " batman forever " ( *num* ) and " batman & robin " ( *num* ) ; the latter two of which were directed by joel schumacher instead of burton , and replaced keaton as batman with val kilmer and george clooney , respectively .
executive producers benjamin melniker and michael e .
uslan filed a breach of contract lawsuit in los angeles county superior court on march *num* , *num* .
melniker and uslan claimed to be " the victims of a sinister campaign of fraud and coercion that has cheated them out of continuing involvement in the production of " batman " and its sequels .
we were denied proper credits , and deprived of any financial rewards for our indispensable creative contribution to the success of " batman " .
" a superior court judge rejected the lawsuit .
total revenues of " batman " have topped $2 billion , with uslan claiming to have " not seen a penny more than that since our net profit participation has proved worthless .
" warner bros .
offered the pair an out-of-court pay-off , a sum described by melniker and uslan's attorney as " two popcorns and two cokes " .
reflecting on the twentieth anniversary of its release in a retrospective article on salon .
com , film commentator scott mendelson noted the continuing impact that " batman " has had on the motion film industry , including the increasing importance of opening weekend box office receipts ; the narrowing window between a film's debut and its video release that caused the demise of second-run movie theaters ; the accelerated acquisition of pre-existing , pre-sold properties for film adaptations that can be readily leveraged for merchandizing tie-ins ; the primacy of the mpaa pg-13 as the target rating for film producers ; and more off-beat , non-traditional casting opportunities for genre films .
the american film institute anointed batman the *ord* greatest movie hero and the joker the *ord* greatest movie villain on " afi's *num* years .
.
.
*num* heroes and villains " .
"batman " has been released on various formats , including vhs , laserdisc , dvd and blu-ray .
in an unprecedented move at the time , it was made available to buy on vhs in the us on november *num* , less than six months after its theatrical release , at a suggested retail price of only $24 .
*num* although most sellers sold it for less .
the *num* " batman : the motion picture anthology 1989-1997 " included 2-disc special edition dvds of the film and all three of its sequels .
the anthology was also released as a 4-disc blu-ray set in *num* , with each film and its previous extras contained on a single disc .
other blu-ray reissues include a " *ord* anniversary " digibook with 50-page booklet , and a steelcase edition ; both also include a digital copy .
most recently the " *ord* anniversary " reissue contained the same disc as before and on a second disc , a new 25-minute featurette : " batman : the birth of the modern blockbuster " .
the film was also included in " the tim burton collection " dvd and blu-ray set in *num* , alongside its first sequel , " batman returns " .
electromagnetic radiation in physics , electromagnetic radiation ( em radiation or emr ) refers to the waves ( or their quanta , photons ) of the electromagnetic field , propagating ( radiating ) through space , carrying electromagnetic radiant energy .
it includes radio waves , microwaves , infrared , ( visible ) light , ultraviolet , x-rays , and gamma rays .
classically , electromagnetic radiation consists of electromagnetic waves , which are synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields that propagate at the speed of light , which , in a vacuum , is commonly denoted " c " .
in homogeneous , isotropic media , the oscillations of the two fields are perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy and wave propagation , forming a transverse wave .
the wavefront of electromagnetic waves emitted from a point source ( such as a light bulb ) is a sphere .
the position of an electromagnetic wave within the electromagnetic spectrum can be characterized by either its frequency of oscillation or its wavelength .
electromagnetic waves of different frequency are called by different names since they have different sources and effects on matter .
in order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength these are : radio waves , microwaves , infrared radiation , visible light , ultraviolet radiation , x-rays and gamma rays .
electromagnetic waves are emitted by electrically charged particles undergoing acceleration , and these waves can subsequently interact with other charged particles , exerting force on them .
em waves carry energy , momentum and angular momentum away from their source particle and can impart those quantities to matter with which they interact .
electromagnetic radiation is associated with those em waves that are free to propagate themselves ( " radiate " ) without the continuing influence of the moving charges that produced them , because they have achieved sufficient distance from those charges .
thus , emr is sometimes referred to as the far field .
in this language , the near field refers to em fields near the charges and current that directly produced them specifically , electromagnetic induction and electrostatic induction phenomena .
in quantum mechanics , an alternate way of viewing emr is that it consists of photons , uncharged elementary particles with zero rest mass which are the quanta of the electromagnetic force , responsible for all electromagnetic interactions .
quantum electrodynamics is the theory of how emr interacts with matter on an atomic level .
quantum effects provide additional sources of emr , such as the transition of electrons to lower energy levels in an atom and black-body radiation .
the energy of an individual photon is quantized and is greater for photons of higher frequency .
this relationship is given by planck's equation " e " = " hν " , where " e " is the energy per photon , " ν " is the frequency of the photon , and " h " is planck's constant .
a single gamma ray photon , for example , might carry ~100 , *num* times the energy of a single photon of visible light .
the effects of emr upon chemical compounds and biological organisms depend both upon the radiation's power and its frequency .
emr of visible or lower frequencies ( i .
e .
, visible light , infrared , microwaves , and radio waves ) is called " non-ionizing radiation " , because its photons do not individually have enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules or break chemical bonds .
the effects of these radiations on chemical systems and living tissue are caused primarily by heating effects from the combined energy transfer of many photons .
in contrast , high frequency ultraviolet , x-rays and gamma rays are called " ionizing radiation " , since individual photons of such high frequency have enough energy to ionize molecules or break chemical bonds .
these radiations have the ability to cause chemical reactions and damage living cells beyond that resulting from simple heating , and can be a health hazard .
james clerk maxwell derived a wave form of the electric and magnetic equations , thus uncovering the wave-like nature of electric and magnetic fields and their symmetry .
because the speed of em waves predicted by the wave equation coincided with the measured speed of light , maxwell concluded that light itself is an em wave .
maxwell's equations were confirmed by heinrich hertz through experiments with radio waves .
according to maxwell's equations , a spatially varying electric field is always associated with a magnetic field that changes over time .
likewise , a spatially varying magnetic field is associated with specific changes over time in the electric field .
in an electromagnetic wave , the changes in the electric field are always accompanied by a wave in the magnetic field in one direction , and vice versa .
this relationship between the two occurs without either type of field causing the other ; rather , they occur together in the same way that time and space changes occur together and are interlinked in special relativity .
in fact , magnetic fields can be viewed as electric fields in another frame of reference , and electric fields can be viewed as magnetic fields in another frame of reference , but they have equal significance as physics is the same in all frames of reference , so the close relationship between space and time changes here is more than an analogy .
together , these fields form a propagating electromagnetic wave , which moves out into space and need never again interact with the source .
the distant em field formed in this way by the acceleration of a charge carries energy with it that " radiates " away through space , hence the term .
maxwell's equations established that some charges and currents ( " sources " ) produce a local type of electromagnetic field near them that does " not " have the behaviour of emr .
currents directly produce a magnetic field , but it is of a magnetic dipole type that dies out with distance from the current .
in a similar manner , moving charges pushed apart in a conductor by a changing electrical potential ( such as in an antenna ) produce an electric dipole type electrical field , but this also declines with distance .
these fields make up the near-field near the emr source .
neither of these behaviours are responsible for em radiation .
instead , they cause electromagnetic field behaviour that only efficiently transfers power to a receiver very close to the source , such as the magnetic induction inside a transformer , or the feedback behaviour that happens close to the coil of a metal detector .
typically , near-fields have a powerful effect on their own sources , causing an increased “load” ( decreased electrical reactance ) in the source or transmitter , whenever energy is withdrawn from the em field by a receiver .
otherwise , these fields do not “propagate” freely out into space , carrying their energy away without distance-limit , but rather oscillate , returning their energy to the transmitter if it is not received by a receiver .
by contrast , the em far-field is composed of " radiation " that is free of the transmitter in the sense that ( unlike the case in an electrical transformer ) the transmitter requires the same power to send these changes in the fields out , whether the signal is immediately picked up or not .
this distant part of the electromagnetic field " is " " electromagnetic radiation " ( also called the far-field ) .
the far-fields propagate ( radiate ) without allowing the transmitter to affect them .
this causes them to be independent in the sense that their existence and their energy , after they have left the transmitter , is completely independent of both transmitter and receiver .
due to conservation of energy , the amount of power passing through any spherical surface drawn around the source is the same .
because such a surface has an area proportional to the square of its distance from the source , the power density of em radiation always decreases with the inverse square of distance from the source ; this is called the inverse-square law .
this is in contrast to dipole parts of the em field close to the source ( the near-field ) , which varies in power according to an inverse cube power law , and thus does " not " transport a conserved amount of energy over distances , but instead fades with distance , with its energy ( as noted ) rapidly returning to the transmitter or absorbed by a nearby receiver ( such as a transformer secondary coil ) .
the far-field ( emr ) depends on a different mechanism for its production than the near-field , and upon different terms in maxwell's equations .
whereas the magnetic part of the near-field is due to currents in the source , the magnetic field in emr is due only to the local change in the electric field .
in a similar way , while the electric field in the near-field is due directly to the charges and charge-separation in the source , the electric field in emr is due to a change in the local magnetic field .
both processes for producing electric and magnetic emr fields have a different dependence on distance than do near-field dipole electric and magnetic fields .
that is why the emr type of em field becomes dominant in power “far” from sources .
the term “far from sources” refers to how far from the source ( moving at the speed of light ) any portion of the outward-moving em field is located , by the time that source currents are changed by the varying source potential , and the source has therefore begun to generate an outwardly moving em field of a different phase .
a more compact view of emr is that the far-field that composes emr is generally that part of the em field that has traveled sufficient distance from the source , that it has become completely disconnected from any feedback to the charges and currents that were originally responsible for it .
now independent of the source charges , the em field , as it moves farther away , is dependent only upon the accelerations of the charges that produced it .
it no longer has a strong connection to the direct fields of the charges , or to the velocity of the charges ( currents ) .
in the liénard–wiechert potential formulation of the electric and magnetic fields due to motion of a single particle ( according to maxwell's equations ) , the terms associated with acceleration of the particle are those that are responsible for the part of the field that is regarded as electromagnetic radiation .
by contrast , the term associated with the changing static electric field of the particle and the magnetic term that results from the particle's uniform velocity , are both associated with the electromagnetic near-field , and do not comprise em radiation .
electrodynamics is the physics of electromagnetic radiation , and electromagnetism is the physical phenomenon associated with the theory of electrodynamics .
electric and magnetic fields obey the properties of superposition .
thus , a field due to any particular particle or time-varying electric or magnetic field contributes to the fields present in the same space due to other causes .
further , as they are vector fields , all magnetic and electric field vectors add together according to vector addition .
for example , in optics two or more coherent lightwaves may interact and by constructive or destructive interference yield a resultant irradiance deviating from the sum of the component irradiances of the individual lightwaves .
since light is an oscillation it is not affected by traveling through static electric or magnetic fields in a linear medium such as a vacuum .
however , in nonlinear media , such as some crystals , interactions can occur between light and static electric and magnetic fields — these interactions include the faraday effect and the kerr effect .
in refraction , a wave crossing from one medium to another of different density alters its speed and direction upon entering the new medium .
the ratio of the refractive indices of the media determines the degree of refraction , and is summarized by snell's law .
light of composite wavelengths ( natural sunlight ) disperses into a visible spectrum passing through a prism , because of the wavelength-dependent refractive index of the prism material ( dispersion ) ; that is , each component wave within the composite light is bent a different amount .
em radiation exhibits both wave properties and particle properties at the same time ( see wave-particle duality ) .
both wave and particle characteristics have been confirmed in many experiments .
wave characteristics are more apparent when em radiation is measured over relatively large timescales and over large distances while particle characteristics are more evident when measuring small timescales and distances .
for example , when electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by matter , particle-like properties will be more obvious when the average number of photons in the cube of the relevant wavelength is much smaller than *num* .
it is not too difficult to experimentally observe non-uniform deposition of energy when light is absorbed , however this alone is not evidence of " particulate " behavior .
rather , it reflects the quantum nature of " matter " .
demonstrating that the light itself is quantized , not merely its interaction with matter , is a more subtle affair .
some experiments display both the wave and particle natures of electromagnetic waves , such as the self-interference of a single photon .
when a single photon is sent through an interferometer , it passes through both paths , interfering with itself , as waves do , yet is detected by a photomultiplier or other sensitive detector only once .
a quantum theory of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter such as electrons is described by the theory of quantum electrodynamics .
electromagnetic waves can be polarized , reflected , refracted , diffracted or interfere with each other .
in homogeneous , isotropic media , electromagnetic radiation is a transverse wave , meaning that its oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer and travel .
the electric and magnetic parts of the field stand in a fixed ratio of strengths in order to satisfy the two maxwell equations that specify how one is produced from the other .
in dissipation less ( lossless ) media , these e and b fields are also in phase , with both reaching maxima and minima at the same points in space ( see illustrations ) .
a common misconception is that the e and b fields in electromagnetic radiation are out of phase because a change in one produces the other , and this would produce a phase difference between them as sinusoidal functions ( as indeed happens in electromagnetic induction , and in the near-field close to antennas ) .
however , in the far-field em radiation which is described by the two source-free maxwell curl operator equations , a more correct description is that a time-change in one type of field is proportional to a space-change in the other .
these derivatives require that the e and b fields in emr are in-phase ( see math section below ) .
an important aspect of light's nature is its frequency .
the frequency of a wave is its rate of oscillation and is measured in hertz , the si unit of frequency , where one hertz is equal to one oscillation per second .
light usually has multiple frequencies that sum to form the resultant wave .
different frequencies undergo different angles of refraction , a phenomenon known as dispersion .
a wave consists of successive troughs and crests , and the distance between two adjacent crests or troughs is called the wavelength .
waves of the electromagnetic spectrum vary in size , from very long radio waves the size of buildings to very short gamma rays smaller than atom nuclei .
frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength , according to the equation : where " v " is the speed of the wave ( " c " in a vacuum , or less in other media ) , " f " is the frequency and λ is the wavelength .
as waves cross boundaries between different media , their speeds change but their frequencies remain constant .
electromagnetic waves in free space must be solutions of maxwell's electromagnetic wave equation .
two main classes of solutions are known , namely plane waves and spherical waves .
the plane waves may be viewed as the limiting case of spherical waves at a very large ( ideally infinite ) distance from the source .
both types of waves can have a waveform which is an arbitrary time function ( so long as it is sufficiently differentiable to conform to the wave equation ) .
as with any time function , this can be decomposed by means of fourier analysis into its frequency spectrum , or individual sinusoidal components , each of which contains a single frequency , amplitude and phase .
such a component wave is said to be " monochromatic " .
a monochromatic electromagnetic wave can be characterized by its frequency or wavelength , its peak amplitude , its phase relative to some reference phase , its direction of propagation and its polarization .
interference is the superposition of two or more waves resulting in a new wave pattern .
if the fields have components in the same direction , they constructively interfere , while opposite directions cause destructive interference .
an example of interference caused by emr is electromagnetic interference ( emi ) or as it is more commonly known as , radio-frequency interference ( rfi ) .
additionally , multiple polarization signals can be combined ( i .
e .
interfered ) to form new states of polarization , which is known as parallel polarization state generation .
the energy in electromagnetic waves is sometimes called radiant energy .
an anomaly arose in the late *ord* century involving a contradiction between the wave theory of light and measurements of the electromagnetic spectra that were being emitted by thermal radiators known as black bodies .
physicists struggled with this problem , which later became known as the ultraviolet catastrophe , unsuccessfully for many years .
in *num* , max planck developed a new theory of black-body radiation that explained the observed spectrum .
planck's theory was based on the idea that black bodies emit light ( and other electromagnetic radiation ) only as discrete bundles or packets of energy .
these packets were called quanta .
later , albert einstein proposed that light quanta be regarded as real particles .
later the particle of light was given the name photon , to correspond with other particles being described around this time , such as the electron and proton .
a photon has an energy , " e " , proportional to its frequency , " f " , by where " h " is planck's constant , formula_3 is the wavelength and " c " is the speed of light .
this is sometimes known as the planck–einstein equation .
in quantum theory ( see first quantization ) the energy of the photons is thus directly proportional to the frequency of the emr wave .
likewise , the momentum " p " of a photon is also proportional to its frequency and inversely proportional to its wavelength : the source of einstein's proposal that light was composed of particles ( or could act as particles in some circumstances ) was an experimental anomaly not explained by the wave theory : the photoelectric effect , in which light striking a metal surface ejected electrons from the surface , causing an electric current to flow across an applied voltage .
experimental measurements demonstrated that the energy of individual ejected electrons was proportional to the " frequency " , rather than the " intensity " , of the light .
furthermore , below a certain minimum frequency , which depended on the particular metal , no current would flow regardless of the intensity .
these observations appeared to contradict the wave theory , and for years physicists tried in vain to find an explanation .
in *num* , einstein explained this puzzle by resurrecting the particle theory of light to explain the observed effect .
because of the preponderance of evidence in favor of the wave theory , however , einstein's ideas were met initially with great skepticism among established physicists .
eventually einstein's explanation was accepted as new particle-like behavior of light was observed , such as the compton effect .
as a photon is absorbed by an atom , it excites the atom , elevating an electron to a higher energy level ( one that is on average farther from the nucleus ) .
when an electron in an excited molecule or atom descends to a lower energy level , it emits a photon of light at a frequency corresponding to the energy difference .
since the energy levels of electrons in atoms are discrete , each element and each molecule emits and absorbs its own characteristic frequencies .
immediate photon emission is called fluorescence , a type of photoluminescence .
an example is visible light emitted from fluorescent paints , in response to ultraviolet ( blacklight ) .
many other fluorescent emissions are known in spectral bands other than visible light .
delayed emission is called phosphorescence .
the modern theory that explains the nature of light includes the notion of wave–particle duality .
more generally , the theory states that everything has both a particle nature and a wave nature , and various experiments can be done to bring out one or the other .
the particle nature is more easily discerned using an object with a large mass .
a bold proposition by louis de broglie in *num* led the scientific community to realize that electrons also exhibited wave–particle duality .
together , wave and particle effects fully explain the emission and absorption spectra of em radiation .
the matter-composition of the medium through which the light travels determines the nature of the absorption and emission spectrum .
these bands correspond to the allowed energy levels in the atoms .
dark bands in the absorption spectrum are due to the atoms in an intervening medium between source and observer .
the atoms absorb certain frequencies of the light between emitter and detector / eye , then emit them in all directions .
a dark band appears to the detector , due to the radiation scattered out of the beam .
for instance , dark bands in the light emitted by a distant star are due to the atoms in the star's atmosphere .
a similar phenomenon occurs for emission , which is seen when an emitting gas glows due to excitation of the atoms from any mechanism , including heat .
as electrons descend to lower energy levels , a spectrum is emitted that represents the jumps between the energy levels of the electrons , but lines are seen because again emission happens only at particular energies after excitation .
an example is the emission spectrum of nebulae .
rapidly moving electrons are most sharply accelerated when they encounter a region of force , so they are responsible for producing much of the highest frequency electromagnetic radiation observed in nature .
these phenomena can aid various chemical determinations for the composition of gases lit from behind ( absorption spectra ) and for glowing gases ( emission spectra ) .
spectroscopy ( for example ) determines what chemical elements comprise a particular star .
spectroscopy is also used in the determination of the distance of a star , using the red shift .
when any wire ( or other conducting object such as an antenna ) conducts alternating current , electromagnetic radiation is propagated at the same frequency as the current .
in many such situations it is possible to identify an electrical dipole moment that arises from separation of charges due to the exciting electrical potential , and this dipole moment oscillates in time , as the charges move back and forth .
this oscillation at a given frequency gives rise to changing electric and magnetic fields , which then set the electromagnetic radiation in motion .
at the quantum level , electromagnetic radiation is produced when the wavepacket of a charged particle oscillates or otherwise accelerates .
charged particles in a stationary state do not move , but a superposition of such states may result in a transition state that has an electric dipole moment that oscillates in time .
this oscillating dipole moment is responsible for the phenomenon of radiative transition between quantum states of a charged particle .
such states occur ( for example ) in atoms when photons are radiated as the atom shifts from one stationary state to another .
as a wave , light is characterized by a velocity ( the speed of light ) , wavelength , and frequency .
as particles , light is a stream of photons .
each has an energy related to the frequency of the wave given by planck's relation " e = hf " , where " e " is the energy of the photon , " h " = *num* .
*num* × *num* j·s is planck's constant , and " f " is the frequency of the wave .
one rule is obeyed regardless of circumstances : em radiation in a vacuum travels at the speed of light , " relative to the observer " , regardless of the observer's velocity .
( this observation led to einstein's development of the theory of special relativity .
) in a medium ( other than vacuum ) , velocity factor or refractive index are considered , depending on frequency and application .
both of these are ratios of the speed in a medium to speed in a vacuum .
by the late nineteenth century , various experimental anomalies could not be explained by the simple wave theory .
one of these anomalies involved a controversy over the speed of light .
the speed of light and other emr predicted by maxwell's equations did not appear unless the equations were modified in a way first suggested by fitzgerald and lorentz ( see history of special relativity ) , or else otherwise that speed would depend on the speed of observer relative to the " medium " ( called luminiferous aether ) which supposedly " carried " the electromagnetic wave ( in a manner analogous to the way air carries sound waves ) .
experiments failed to find any observer effect .
in *num* , einstein proposed that space and time appeared to be velocity-changeable entities for light propagation and all other processes and laws .
these changes accounted for the constancy of the speed of light and all electromagnetic radiation , from the viewpoints of all observers—even those in relative motion .
electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths other than those of visible light were discovered in the early *ord* century .
the discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to astronomer william herschel , who published his results in *num* before the royal society of london .
herschel used a glass prism to refract light from the sun and detected invisible rays that caused heating beyond the red part of the spectrum , through an increase in the temperature recorded with a thermometer .
these " calorific rays " were later termed infrared .
in *num* , german physicist johann wilhelm ritter discovered ultraviolet in an experiment similar to hershel's , using sunlight and a glass prism .
ritter noted that invisible rays near the violet edge of a solar spectrum dispersed by a triangular prism darkened silver chloride preparations more quickly than did the nearby violet light .
ritter's experiments were an early precursor to what would become photography .
ritter noted that the ultraviolet rays ( which at first were called " chemical rays " ) were capable of causing chemical reactions .
in 1862-4 james clerk maxwell developed equations for the electromagnetic field which suggested that waves in the field would travel with a speed that was very close to the known speed of light .
maxwell therefore suggested that visible light ( as well as invisible infrared and ultraviolet rays by inference ) all consisted of propagating disturbances ( or radiation ) in the electromagnetic field .
radio waves were first produced deliberately by heinrich hertz in *num* , using electrical circuits calculated to produce oscillations at a much lower frequency than that of visible light , following recipes for producing oscillating charges and currents suggested by maxwell's equations .
hertz also developed ways to detect these waves , and produced and characterized what were later termed radio waves and microwaves .
wilhelm röntgen discovered and named x-rays .
after experimenting with high voltages applied to an evacuated tube on *num* november *num* , he noticed a fluorescence on a nearby plate of coated glass .
in one month , he discovered x-rays ' main properties .
the last portion of the em spectrum to be discovered was associated with radioactivity .
henri becquerel found that uranium salts caused fogging of an unexposed photographic plate through a covering paper in a manner similar to x-rays , and marie curie discovered that only certain elements gave off these rays of energy , soon discovering the intense radiation of radium .
the radiation from pitchblende was differentiated into alpha rays ( alpha particles ) and beta rays ( beta particles ) by ernest rutherford through simple experimentation in *num* , but these proved to be charged particulate types of radiation .
however , in *num* the french scientist paul villard discovered a third neutrally charged and especially penetrating type of radiation from radium , and after he described it , rutherford realized it must be yet a third type of radiation , which in *num* rutherford named gamma rays .
in *num* british physicist william henry bragg demonstrated that gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation , not particles , and in *num* rutherford and edward andrade measured their wavelengths , finding that they were similar to x-rays but with shorter wavelengths and higher frequency , although a ' cross-over ' between x and gamma rays makes it possible to have x-rays with a higher energy ( and hence shorter wavelength ) than gamma rays and vice versa .
the origin of the ray differentiates them , gamma rays tend to be a natural phenomena originating from the unstable nucleus of an atom and x-rays are electrically generated ( and hence man-made ) unless they are as a result of bremsstrahlung x-radiation caused by the interaction of fast moving particles ( such as beta particles ) colliding with certain materials , usually of higher atomic numbers .
em radiation ( the designation ' radiation ' excludes static electric and magnetic and near fields ) is classified by wavelength into radio , microwave , infrared , visible , ultraviolet , x-rays and gamma rays .
arbitrary electromagnetic waves can be expressed by fourier analysis in terms of sinusoidal monochromatic waves , which in turn can each be classified into these regions of the emr spectrum .
for certain classes of em waves , the waveform is most usefully treated as " random " , and then spectral analysis must be done by slightly different mathematical techniques appropriate to random or stochastic processes .
in such cases , the individual frequency components are represented in terms of their " power " content , and the phase information is not preserved .
such a representation is called the power spectral density of the random process .
random electromagnetic radiation requiring this kind of analysis is , for example , encountered in the interior of stars , and in certain other very wideband forms of radiation such as the zero point wave field of the electromagnetic vacuum .
the behavior of em radiation and its interaction with matter depends on its frequency , and changes qualitatively as the frequency changes .
lower frequencies have longer wavelengths , and higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths , and are associated with photons of higher energy .
there is no fundamental limit known to these wavelengths or energies , at either end of the spectrum , although photons with energies near the planck energy or exceeding it ( far too high to have ever been observed ) will require new physical theories to describe .
soundwaves are not electromagnetic radiation .
at the lower end of the electromagnetic spectrum , about *num* hz to about *num* khz , are frequencies that might be considered in the audio range .
however , electromagnetic waves cannot be directly perceived by human ears .
sound waves are instead the oscillating compression of molecules .
to be heard , electromagnetic radiation must be converted to pressure waves of the fluid in which the ear is located ( whether the fluid is air , water or something else ) .
radio waves have the least amount of energy and the lowest frequency .
when radio waves impinge upon a conductor , they couple to the conductor , travel along it and induce an electric current on the conductor surface by moving the electrons of the conducting material in correlated bunches of charge .
such effects can cover macroscopic distances in conductors ( such as radio antennas ) , since the wavelength of radiowaves is long .
electromagnetic radiation phenomena with wavelengths ranging from as long as one meter to as short as one millimeter are called microwaves ; with frequencies between *num* mhz ( *num* .
*num* ghz ) and *num* ghz .
at radio and microwave frequencies , emr interacts with matter largely as a bulk collection of charges which are spread out over large numbers of affected atoms .
in electrical conductors , such induced bulk movement of charges ( electric currents ) results in absorption of the emr , or else separations of charges that cause generation of new emr ( effective reflection of the emr ) .
an example is absorption or emission of radio waves by antennas , or absorption of microwaves by water or other molecules with an electric dipole moment , as for example inside a microwave oven .
these interactions produce either electric currents or heat , or both .
like radio and microwave , infrared also is reflected by metals ( as is most emr into the ultraviolet ) .
however , unlike lower-frequency radio and microwave radiation , infrared emr commonly interacts with dipoles present in single molecules , which change as atoms vibrate at the ends of a single chemical bond .
it is consequently absorbed by a wide range of substances , causing them to increase in temperature as the vibrations dissipate as heat .
the same process , run in reverse , causes bulk substances to radiate in the infrared spontaneously ( see thermal radiation section below ) .
natural sources produce em radiation across the spectrum .
em radiation with a wavelength between approximately *num* nm and *num* nm is directly detected by the human eye and perceived as visible light .
other wavelengths , especially nearby infrared ( longer than *num* nm ) and ultraviolet ( shorter than *num* nm ) are also sometimes referred to as light .
as frequency increases into the visible range , photons have enough energy to change the bond structure of some individual molecules .
it is not a coincidence that this happens in the " visible range , " as the mechanism of vision involves the change in bonding of a single molecule ( retinal ) which absorbs light in the rhodopsin in the retina of the human eye .
photosynthesis becomes possible in this range as well , for similar reasons , as a single molecule of chlorophyll is excited by a single photon .
animals that detect infrared make use of small packets of water that change temperature , in an essentially thermal process that involves many photons ( see infrared sensing in snakes ) .
for this reason , infrared , microwaves and radio waves are thought to damage molecules and biological tissue only by bulk heating , not excitation from single photons of the radiation .
visible light is able to affect a few molecules with single photons , but usually not in a permanent or damaging way , in the absence of power high enough to increase temperature to damaging levels .
however , in plant tissues that conduct photosynthesis , carotenoids act to quench electronically excited chlorophyll produced by visible light in a process called non-photochemical quenching , in order to prevent reactions that would otherwise interfere with photosynthesis at high light levels .
limited evidence indicate that some reactive oxygen species are created by visible light in skin , and that these may have some role in photoaging , in the same manner as ultraviolet a .
as frequency increases into the ultraviolet , photons now carry enough energy ( about three electron volts or more ) to excite certain doubly bonded molecules into permanent chemical rearrangement .
in dna , this causes lasting damage .
dna is also indirectly damaged by reactive oxygen species produced by ultraviolet a ( uva ) , which has energy too low to damage dna directly .
this is why ultraviolet at all wavelengths can damage dna , and is capable of causing cancer , and ( for uvb ) skin burns ( sunburn ) that are far worse than would be produced by simple heating ( temperature increase ) effects .
this property of causing molecular damage that is out of proportion to heating effects , is characteristic of all emr with frequencies at the visible light range and above .
these properties of high-frequency emr are due to quantum effects that permanently damage materials and tissues at the molecular level .
at the higher end of the ultraviolet range , the energy of photons becomes large enough to impart enough energy to electrons to cause them to be liberated from the atom , in a process called photoionisation .
the energy required for this is always larger than about *num* electron volt ( ev ) corresponding with wavelengths smaller than *num* nm ( some sources suggest a more realistic cutoff of *num* ev , which is the energy required to ionize water ) .
this high end of the ultraviolet spectrum with energies in the approximate ionization range , is sometimes called " extreme uv .
" ionizing uv is strongly filtered by the earth's atmosphere ) .
electromagnetic radiation composed of photons that carry minimum-ionization energy , or more , ( which includes the entire spectrum with shorter wavelengths ) , is therefore termed ionizing radiation .
( many other kinds of ionizing radiation are made of non-em particles ) .
electromagnetic-type ionizing radiation extends from the extreme ultraviolet to all higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths , which means that all x-rays and gamma rays qualify .
these are capable of the most severe types of molecular damage , which can happen in biology to any type of biomolecule , including mutation and cancer , and often at great depths below the skin , since the higher end of the x-ray spectrum , and all of the gamma ray spectrum , penetrate matter .
most uv and x-rays are blocked by absorption first from molecular nitrogen , and then ( for wavelengths in the upper uv ) from the electronic excitation of dioxygen and finally ozone at the mid-range of uv .
only *num* % of the sun's ultraviolet light reaches the ground , and almost all of this is well transmitted .
visible light is well transmitted in air , as it is not energetic enough to excite nitrogen , oxygen , or ozone , but too energetic to excite molecular vibrational frequencies of water vapor .
absorption bands in the infrared are due to modes of vibrational excitation in water vapor .
however , at energies too low to excite water vapor , the atmosphere becomes transparent again , allowing free transmission of most microwave and radio waves .
finally , at radio wavelengths longer than *num* meters or so ( about *num* mhz ) , the air in the lower atmosphere remains transparent to radio , but plasma in certain layers of the ionosphere begins to interact with radio waves ( see skywave ) .
this property allows some longer wavelengths ( *num* meters or *num* mhz ) to be reflected and results in shortwave radio beyond line-of-sight .
however , certain ionospheric effects begin to block incoming radiowaves from space , when their frequency is less than about *num* mhz ( wavelength longer than about *num* meters ) .
the basic structure of matter involves charged particles bound together .
when electromagnetic radiation impinges on matter , it causes the charged particles to oscillate and gain energy .
the ultimate fate of this energy depends on the context .
it could be immediately re-radiated and appear as scattered , reflected , or transmitted radiation .
it may get dissipated into other microscopic motions within the matter , coming to thermal equilibrium and manifesting itself as thermal energy , or even kinetic energy , in the material .
with a few exceptions related to high-energy photons ( such as fluorescence , harmonic generation , photochemical reactions , the photovoltaic effect for ionizing radiations at far ultraviolet , x-ray and gamma radiation ) , absorbed electromagnetic radiation simply deposits its energy by heating the material .
this happens for infrared , microwave and radio wave radiation .
intense radio waves can thermally burn living tissue and can cook food .
in addition to infrared lasers , sufficiently intense visible and ultraviolet lasers can easily set paper afire .
ionizing radiation creates high-speed electrons in a material and breaks chemical bonds , but after these electrons collide many times with other atoms eventually most of the energy becomes thermal energy all in a tiny fraction of a second .
this process makes ionizing radiation far more dangerous per unit of energy than non-ionizing radiation .
this caveat also applies to uv , even though almost all of it is not ionizing , because uv can damage molecules due to electronic excitation , which is far greater per unit energy than heating effects .
infrared radiation in the spectral distribution of a black body is usually considered a form of heat , since it has an equivalent temperature and is associated with an entropy change per unit of thermal energy .
however , " heat " is a technical term in physics and thermodynamics and is often confused with thermal energy .
any type of electromagnetic energy can be transformed into thermal energy in interaction with matter .
thus , " any " electromagnetic radiation can " heat " ( in the sense of increase the thermal energy temperature of ) a material , when it is absorbed .
the inverse or time-reversed process of absorption is thermal radiation .
much of the thermal energy in matter consists of random motion of charged particles , and this energy can be radiated away from the matter .
the resulting radiation may subsequently be absorbed by another piece of matter , with the deposited energy heating the material .
the electromagnetic radiation in an opaque cavity at thermal equilibrium is effectively a form of thermal energy , having maximum radiation entropy .
bioelectromagnetics is the study of the interactions and effects of em radiation on living organisms .
the effects of electromagnetic radiation upon living cells , including those in humans , depends upon the radiation's power and frequency .
for low-frequency radiation ( radio waves to visible light ) the best-understood effects are those due to radiation power alone , acting through heating when radiation is absorbed .
for these thermal effects , frequency is important only as it affects penetration into the organism ( for example , microwaves penetrate better than infrared ) .
it is widely accepted that low frequency fields that are too weak to cause significant heating could not possibly have any biological effect .
despite the commonly accepted results , some research has been conducted to show that weaker " non-thermal " electromagnetic fields , ( including weak elf magnetic fields , although the latter does not strictly qualify as em radiation ) , and modulated rf and microwave fields have biological effects .
fundamental mechanisms of the interaction between biological material and electromagnetic fields at non-thermal levels are not fully understood .
the world health organization has classified radio frequency electromagnetic radiation as group 2b - possibly carcinogenic .
this group contains possible carcinogens such as lead , ddt , and styrene .
for example , epidemiological studies looking for a relationship between cell phone use and brain cancer development , have been largely inconclusive , save to demonstrate that the effect , if it exists , cannot be a large one .
at higher frequencies ( visible and beyond ) , the effects of individual photons begin to become important , as these now have enough energy individually to directly or indirectly damage biological molecules .
all uv frequences have been classed as group *num* carcinogens by the world health organization .
ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure is the primary cause of skin cancer .
thus , at uv frequencies and higher ( and probably somewhat also in the visible range ) , electromagnetic radiation does more damage to biological systems than simple heating predicts .
this is most obvious in the " far " ( or " extreme " ) ultraviolet .
uv , with x-ray and gamma radiation , are referred to as ionizing radiation due to the ability of photons of this radiation to produce ions and free radicals in materials ( including living tissue ) .
since such radiation can severely damage life at energy levels that produce little heating , it is considered far more dangerous ( in terms of damage-produced per unit of energy , or power ) than the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum .
the heat ray is an application of emr that makes use of microwave frequencies to create an unpleasant heating effect in the upper layer of the skin .
a publicly known heat ray weapon called the active denial system was developed by the us military as an experimental weapon to deny the enemy access to an area .
a death ray is a weapon that delivers heat ray electromagnetic energy at levels that injure human tissue .
the inventor of the death ray , harry grindell matthews , claims to have lost sight in his left eye while developing his death ray weapon based on a primitive microwave magnetron from the 1920s ( note that a typical microwave oven induces a tissue damaging cooking effect inside the oven at about *num* kv / m ) .
electromagnetic waves are predicted by the classical laws of electricity and magnetism , known as maxwell's equations .
there are nontrivial solutions of the homogeneous maxwell's equations ( without charges or currents ) , describing " waves " of changing electric and magnetic fields .
beginning with maxwell's equations in free space : besides the trivial solution useful solutions can be derived with the following vector identity , valid for all vectors formula_16 in some vector field : taking the curl of the second maxwell equation ( ) yields : evaluating the left hand side of ( ) with the above identity and simplifying using ( ) , yields : evaluating the right hand side of ( ) by exchanging the sequence of derivations and inserting the fourth yields : combining ( ) and ( ) again , gives a vector-valued differential equation for the electric field , solving the homogeneous maxwell equations : taking the curl of the fourth maxwell equation ( ) results in a similar differential equation for a magnetic field solving the homogeneous maxwell equations : both differential equations have the form of the general wave equation for waves propagating with speed formula_18 where formula_19 is a function of time and location , which gives the amplitude of the wave at some time at a certain location : for a generic wave traveling in the formula_24 direction .
this form will satisfy the wave equation .
the first of maxwell's equations implies that the electric field is orthogonal to the direction the wave propagates .
the second of maxwell's equations yields the magnetic field .
the remaining equations will be satisfied by this choice of formula_29 .
the electric and magnetic field waves in the far-field travel at the speed of light .
they have a special restricted orientation and proportional magnitudes , formula_30 , which can be seen immediately from the poynting vector .
the electric field , magnetic field , and direction of wave propagation are all orthogonal , and the wave propagates in the same direction as formula_31 .
also , e and b far-fields in free space , which as wave solutions depend primarily on these two maxwell equations , are in-phase with each other .
this is guaranteed since the generic wave solution is first order in both space and time , and the curl operator on one side of these equations results in first-order spatial derivatives of the wave solution , while the time-derivative on the other side of the equations , which gives the other field , is first-order in time , resulting in the same phase shift for both fields in each mathematical operation .
from the viewpoint of an electromagnetic wave traveling forward , the electric field might be oscillating up and down , while the magnetic field oscillates right and left .
this picture can be rotated with the electric field oscillating right and left and the magnetic field oscillating down and up .
this is a different solution that is traveling in the same direction .
this arbitrariness in the orientation with respect to propagation direction is known as polarization .
on a quantum level , it is described as photon polarization .
the direction of the polarization is defined as the direction of the electric field .
more general forms of the second-order wave equations given above are available , allowing for both non-vacuum propagation media and sources .
many competing derivations exist , all with varying levels of approximation and intended applications .
one very general example is a form of the electric field equation , which was factorized into a pair of explicitly directional wave equations , and then efficiently reduced into a single uni-directional wave equation by means of a simple slow-evolution approximation .

but this is the beauty of the album ; the ensembles provide a forum for zorn to expand his compositions .
the album consistently impresses .

*num* drachmae per euro .
greece is a member of the international monetary fund and of the world trade organization , and ranked *ord* on ernst & young's globalization index *num* .
world war ii ( 1939-1945 ) devastated the country's economy , but the high levels of economic growth that followed from *num* to *num* have been called the greek economic miracle .
from *num* greece saw high levels of gdp growth above the eurozone average , peaking at *num* .
*num* % in *num* and *num* .
*num* % in *num* .
the subsequent great recession and greek government-debt crisis , a central focus of the wider european debt crisis , plunged the economy into a sharp downturn , with real gdp growth rates of −0 .

*num* % in *num* and by *num* .
*num* % in *num* .
the country returned to modest growth of *num* .
*num* % in *num* .
the evolution of the greek economy during the *ord* century ( a period that transformed a large part of the world because of the industrial revolution ) has been little researched .
recent research from *num* examines the gradual development of industry and further development of shipping in a predominantly agricultural economy , calculating an average rate of per capita gdp growth between *num* and *num* that was only slightly lower than that of the other western european nations .
industrial activity , ( including heavy industry like shipbuilding ) was evident , mainly in ermoupolis and piraeus .
nonetheless , greece faced economic hardships and defaulted on its external loans in *num* , *num* , *num* and *num* .
other studies support the above view on the general trends in the economy , providing comparative measures of standard of living .

*num* % in *num* and *num* .
*num* % in *num* .
the country's post-world war ii development has largely been connected with the greek economic miracle .
during that period , greece saw growth rates second only to those of japan , while ranking first in europe in terms of gdp growth .
it is indicative that between *num* and *num* the greek economy grew by an average of *num* .
*num* % , in contrast to *num* .
*num* % for the eu15 and *num* .
*num* % for the oecd .
also during that period , exports grew by an average annual rate of *num* .
*num* % .
greece enjoys a high standard of living and very high human development index , ranking *ord* in the world in *num* .
however , the severe recession of recent years has seen gdp per capita fall from *num* % of the eu average in *num* to *num* % in *num* .
actual individual consumption ( aic ) per capita fell from *num* % of the eu average to *num* % during the same period .
greece's main industries are tourism , shipping , industrial products , food and tobacco processing , textiles , chemicals , metal products , mining and petroleum .
greece's gdp growth has also , as an average , since the early 1990s been higher than the eu average .
however , the greek economy continues to face significant problems , including high unemployment levels , an inefficient public sector bureaucracy , tax evasion , corruption and low global competitiveness .
greece is ranked *ord* in the world on the corruption perceptions index alongside romania , with only hungary and bulgaria scoring worse among eu member states .
greece also has the eu's lowest index of economic freedom and second lowest global competitiveness index , ranking *ord* and *ord* in the world respectively .
after fourteen consecutive years of economic growth , greece went into recession in *num* .
by the end of *num* , the greek economy faced the highest budget deficit and government debt-to-gdp ratios in the eu .
after several upward revisions , the *num* budget deficit is now estimated at *num* .
*num* % of gdp .
this , combined with rapidly rising debt levels ( *num* .
*num* % of gdp in *num* ) led to a precipitous increase in borrowing costs , effectively shutting greece out of the global financial markets and resulting in a severe economic crisis .
greece was accused of trying to cover up the extent of its massive budget deficit in the wake of the global financial crisis .
the allegation was prompted by the massive revision of the *num* budget deficit forecast by the new pasok government elected in october *num* , from " 6–8 % " ( estimated by the previous new democracy government ) to *num* .
*num* % ( later revised to *num* .
*num* % ) .
however , the accuracy of the revised figures has also been questioned , and in february *num* the hellenic parliament voted in favor of an official investigation following accusations by a former member of the hellenic statistical authority that the deficit had been artificially inflated in order to justify harsher austerity measures .
the greek labor force , which amount around workers , average *num* , *num* hours of work per worker annually in *num* , is ranked fourth among oecd countries , after mexico , south korea and chile .
the groningen growth & development centre has published a poll revealing that between *num* and *num* , greece was the country whose workers have the most hours / year work among european nations ; greeks worked an average of *num* , *num* hours per year , followed by spaniards ( average of *num* , *num* hours / year ) .
as a result of the ongoing economic crisis , industrial production in the country went down by *num* % between march *num* and march *num* , the volume of building activity saw a reduction of *num* % in *num* .
additionally , the turnover in retail sales saw a decline of *num* % between february *num* and february *num* .
between *num* and *num* unemployment skyrocketed , from a generational low of *num* .
*num* % in the second and third quarters of *num* to a high of *num* .
*num* % in june *num* , leaving over a million jobless .
youth unemployment peaked at *num* .
*num* % in may *num* .
in *num* , unemployment was rated around *num* % and youth unemployment around *num* % .
by july *num* , however , the rate had improved and was at *num* .
*num* % .
greece was accepted into the economic and monetary union of the european union by the european council on *num* june *num* , based on a number of criteria ( inflation rate , budget deficit , public debt , long-term interest rates , exchange rate ) using *num* as the reference year .
after an audit commissioned by the incoming new democracy government in *num* , eurostat revealed that the statistics for the budget deficit had been under-reported .
most of the differences in the revised budget deficit numbers were due to a temporary change of accounting practices by the new government , i .
e .
, recording expenses when military material was ordered rather than received .
however , it was the retroactive application of esa95 methodology ( applied since *num* ) by eurostat , that finally raised the reference year ( *num* ) budget deficit to *num* .
*num* % of gdp , thus exceeding the *num* % limit .
this led to claims that greece ( similar claims have been made about other european countries like italy ) had not actually met all five accession criteria , and the common perception that greece entered the eurozone through " falsified " deficit numbers .
in the *num* oecd report for greece , it was clearly stated that " the impact of new accounting rules on the fiscal figures for the years *num* to *num* ranged from *num* .
*num* to *num* percentage point of gdp ; this retroactive change of methodology was responsible for the revised deficit exceeding *num* % in *num* , the year of [ greece's ] emu membership qualification " .
the above led the greek minister of finance to clarify that the *num* budget deficit was below the prescribed *num* % limit when calculated with the esa79 methodology in force at the time of greece's application , and thus the criteria had been met .
the original accounting practice for military expenses was later restored in line with eurostat recommendations , theoretically lowering even the esa95-calculated *num* greek budget deficit to below *num* % ( an official eurostat calculation is still pending for *num* ) .
an error sometimes made is the confusion of discussion regarding greece’s eurozone entry with the controversy regarding usage of derivatives’ deals with u .
s .
banks by greece and other eurozone countries to artificially reduce their reported budget deficits .
a currency swap arranged with goldman sachs allowed greece to " hide " *num* .
*num* billion euros of debt , however , this affected deficit values after *num* ( when greece had already been admitted into the eurozone ) and is not related to greece’s eurozone entry .
a study of the period 1999–2009 by forensic accountants has found that data submitted to eurostat by greece , among other countries , had a statistical distribution indicative of manipulation ; " greece with a mean value of *num* .
*num* , shows the largest deviation from benford's law among the members of the eurozone , followed by belgium with a value of *num* .
*num* and austria with a value of *num* .
*num* " .
greece , like other european nations , had faced debt crises in the *ord* century , as well as a similar crisis in *num* during the great depression .
in general , however , during the *ord* century it enjoyed one of the highest gdp growth rates on the planet between *num* and *num* it steadily rose , surpassing the average of what is today the eurozone in the mid-1980s ( see chart below ) .
for the next *num* years , from *num* to *num* ( i .
e .
, before the financial crisis of 2007–2008 ) , greece’s government debt-to-gdp ratio remained roughly unchanged ( the value was not affected by the *num* athens olympics ) , averaging *num* % - a value lower than that for italy ( *num* % ) and belgium ( *num* % ) during the same 15-year period , and comparable to that for the u .
s .
or the oecd average in *num* .
during the latter period , the country's annual budget deficit usually exceeded *num* % of gdp , but its effect on the debt-to gdp ratio was counterbalanced by high gdp growth rates .
the debt-to gdp values for *num* and *num* ( about *num* % ) were established after audits resulted in corrections according to eurostat methodology , of up to *num* percentage points for the particular years ( as well as similar corrections for the years *num* and *num* ) .
these corrections , although altering the debt level by a maximum of about *num* % , resulted in a popular notion that " greece was previously hiding its debt " .
by the end of *num* , as a result of a combination of international and local factors the greek economy faced its most-severe crisis since the restoration of democracy in *num* as the greek government revised its deficit from a prediction of *num* .
*num* % in early *num* and *num* % in september *num* , to *num* .
*num* % of gross domestic product ( gdp ) .
in early *num* , it was revealed that through the assistance of goldman sachs , jpmorgan chase and numerous other banks , financial products were developed which enabled the governments of greece , italy and many other european countries to hide their borrowing .
dozens of similar agreements were concluded across europe whereby banks supplied cash in advance in exchange for future payments by the governments involved ; in turn , the liabilities of the involved countries were " kept off the books " .
according to " der spiegel " , credits given to european governments were disguised as " swaps " and consequently did not get registered as debt because eurostat at the time ignored statistics involving financial derivatives .
a german derivatives dealer had commented to " der spiegel " that " the maastricht rules can be circumvented quite legally through swaps , " and " in previous years , italy used a similar trick to mask its true debt with the help of a different us bank .
" these conditions had enabled greek as well as many other european governments to spend beyond their means , while meeting the deficit targets of the european union and the monetary union guidelines .
in may *num* , the greek government deficit was again revised and estimated to be *num* .
*num* % which was among the highest relative to gdp , with iceland in first place at *num* .
*num* % and the united kingdom third with *num* .
*num* % .
public debt was forecast , according to some estimates , to hit *num* % of gdp during *num* .
as a consequence , there was a crisis in international confidence in greece's ability to repay its sovereign debt , as reflected by the rise of the country's borrowing rates ( although their slow rise – the 10-year government bond yield only exceeded *num* % in april *num* – coinciding with a large number of negative articles , has led to arguments about the role of international news media in the evolution of the crisis ) .
in order to avert a default ( as high borrowing rates effectively prohibited access to the markets ) , in may *num* the other eurozone countries , and the imf , agreed to a " rescue package " which involved giving greece an immediate € in bail-out loans , with more funds to follow , totaling € .
in order to secure the funding , greece was required to adopt harsh austerity measures to bring its deficit under control .
their implementation was to be monitored and evaluated by the european commission , the european central bank and the imf .
the financial crisis – particularly the austerity package put forth by the eu and the imf – has been met with anger by the greek public , leading to riots and social unrest , while there have been theories about the effect of international media .
despite - others say because of - the long range of austerity measures , the government deficit has not been reduced accordingly , mainly , according to many economists , because of the subsequent recession .
public sector workers have come out on strike in order to resist job cuts and reductions to salaries as the government promises that a large scale privatisation programme will be accelerated .
immigrants are sometimes treated as scapegoats for economic problems by far-right extremists .
in *num* , greece became the first developed market to be reclassified as an emerging market by financial services companies msci and s&p dow jones indices .
by july *num* there were still anger and protests about the austerity measures , with a 24-hour strike among government workers timed to coincide with an audit by inspectors from the international monetary fund , the european union and european central bank in advance of a decision on a second bailout of one billion euros ( $1 .
*num* billion ) , due in late july .
greece exited its six-year recession in the second quarter of *num* , but the challenges of securing political stability and debt sustainability remain .
a third bailout was agreed in july , *num* , after a confrontation with the newly elected leftist government of alexis tsipras .
in june *num* , news reports indicated that the " crushing debt burden " had not been alleviated and that greece was at the risk of defaulting on some payments .
the international monetary fund stated that the country should be able to borrow again " in due course " .
at the time , the euro zone gave greece another credit of $9 .
5-billion , $8 .
*num* billion of loans and brief details of a possible debt relief with the assistance of the imf .
on *num* july , the greek government sent a letter of intent to the imf with *num* commitments it promised to meet by june *num* .
they included changes in labour laws , a plan to cap public sector work contracts , to transform temporary contracts into permanent agreements and to recalculate pension payments to reduce spending on social security .
greece's bailouts successfully ended ( as declared ) on august *num* , *num* .
there was a *num* % drop in greece's gdp , connected with the bailout programmes .
this had a critical effect : the debt-to-gdp ratio , the key factor defining the severity of the crisis , would jump from its *num* level of *num* % to about *num* % , solely due to the gdp drop ( i .
e .
, for the same debt ) .
such a level is considered unsustainable .
in a *num* report , the imf admitted that it had underestimated the effects of so extensive tax hikes and budget cuts on the country’s gdp and issued an informal apology the following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2017 .
inflation under *num* % is in green .
in *num* , greece was the european union's largest producer of cotton ( *num* , *num* tons ) and pistachios ( *num* , *num* tons ) and ranked second in the production of rice ( *num* , *num* tons ) and olives ( *num* , *num* tons ) , third in the production of figs ( *num* , *num* tons ) and almonds ( *num* , *num* tons ) , tomatoes ( *num* , *num* , *num* tons ) and watermelons ( *num* , *num* tons ) and fourth in the production of tobacco ( *num* , *num* tons ) .

of these airports , two are classified as " international " by the hellenic civil aviation authority , but *num* offer international services .
additionally greece has *num* heliports .
greece does not have a flag carrier , but the country’s airline industry is dominated by aegean airlines and its subsidiary olympic air .
between *num* and *num* , olympic airways ( known after *num* as olympic airlines ) was the country’s state-owned flag carrier , but financial problems led to its privatization and relaunch as olympic air in *num* .
both aegean airlines and olympic air have won awards for their services ; in *num* and *num* , aegean airlines was awarded the " best regional airline in europe " award by skytrax , and also has two gold and one silver awards by the era , while olympic air holds one silver era award for " airline of the year " as well as a " "condé nast traveller *num* readers choice awards : top domestic airline" " award .
the greek road network is made up of *num* , *num* km of roads , of which *num* km are highways , ranking *ord* worldwide , as of *num* .
since the entry of greece to the european community ( now the european union ) , a number of important projects ( such as the egnatia odos and the attiki odos ) have been co-funded by the organization , helping to upgrade the country's road network .
in *num* , greece ranked *ord* in the european union in goods transported by road at almost *num* million tons .
greece's rail network is estimated to be at *num* , *num* km .
rail transport in greece is operated by trainose , a subsidiary of the hellenic railways organization ( ose ) .
most of the country's network is standard gauge ( *num* , *num* km ) , while the country also has *num* km of narrow gauge .
a total of *num* km of rail are electrified .
greece has rail connections with bulgaria , north macedonia and turkey .
a total of three suburban railway systems ( proastiakos ) are in operation ( in athens , thessaloniki and patras ) , while one metro system , the athens metro , is operational in athens with another , the thessaloniki metro , under construction .
according to eurostat , greece's largest port by tons of goods transported in *num* is the port of aghioi theodoroi , with *num* .
*num* million tons .
the port of thessaloniki comes second with *num* .
*num* million tons , followed by the port of piraeus , with *num* .
*num* million tons , and the port of eleusis , with *num* .
*num* million tons .
the total number of goods transported through greece in *num* amounted to *num* .
*num* million tons , a considerable drop from the *num* .
*num* million tons transported through the country in *num* .
since then , piraeus has grown to become the mediterranean's third-largest port thanks to heavy investment by chinese logistics giant cosco .
in *num* , piraeus was declared the fastest-growing port in the world .
in *num* piraeus handled *num* , *num* teus , followed by thessaloniki , which handled *num* , *num* teus .
in the same year , *num* .
*num* million people passed through greece's ports , *num* .
*num* million through the port of paloukia in salamis , another *num* .
*num* through the port of perama , *num* .
*num* million through piraeus and *num* .
*num* million through igoumenitsa .
in *num* , piraeus handled a record *num* .
*num* million teus , the third-largest figure in the mediterranean , of which *num* .
*num* million were transported through pier ii , owned by cosco and *num* , *num* were transported through pier i , owned by the greek state .
energy production in greece is dominated by the public power corporation ( known mostly by its acronym δεη , or in english dei ) .
in *num* dei supplied for *num* .
*num* % of all energy demand in greece , while the number fell to *num* .
*num* % in *num* .
almost half ( *num* % ) of dei's power output is generated using lignite , a drop from the *num* .
*num* % in *num* .
another *num* % comes from hydroelectric power plants and another *num* % from natural gas .
between *num* and *num* , independent companies ' energy production increased by *num* % , from *num* , *num* gigawatt hour in *num* to *num* , *num* gwh in *num* .
in *num* renewable energy accounted for *num* % of the country's total energy consumption , a rise from the *num* .
*num* % it accounted for in *num* , but still below the eu average of *num* % in *num* .
*num* % of the country's renewable energy comes from solar power , while most comes from biomass and waste recycling .
in line with the european commission's directive on renewable energy , greece aims to get *num* % of its energy from renewable sources by *num* .
in *num* and for several months , greece produced more than *num* % of its electricity from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric power plants .
greece currently does not have any nuclear power plants in operation , however in *num* the academy of athens suggested that research in the possibility of greek nuclear power plants begin .
greece had *num* million barrels of proven oil reserves as of *num* january *num* .
hellenic petroleum is the country's largest oil company , followed by motor oil hellas .
greece's oil production stands at *num* , *num* barrels per day ( bbl / d ) , ranked *ord* worldwide , while it exports *num* , *num* bbl / d , ranked *ord* , and imports *num* , *num* bbl / d , ranked *ord* .
in *num* the greek government approved the start of oil exploration and drilling in three locations within greece , with an estimated output of *num* to *num* million barrels over the next *num* to *num* years .
the estimated output in euros of the three deposits is €25 billion over a 15-year period , of which €13–€14 billion will enter state coffers .
greece's dispute with turkey over the aegean poses substantial obstacles to oil exploration in the aegean sea .
in addition to the above , greece is also to start oil and gas exploration in other locations in the ionian sea , as well as the libyan sea , within the greek exclusive economic zone , south of crete .
the ministry of the environment , energy and climate change announced that there was interest from various countries ( including norway and the united states ) in exploration , and the first results regarding the amount of oil and gas in these locations were expected in the summer of *num* .
in november *num* , a report published by deutsche bank estimated the value of natural gas reserves south of crete at €427 billion .
a number of oil and gas pipelines are currently under construction or under planning in the country .
such projects include the " interconnector turkey-greece-italy " ( itgi ) and " south stream " gas pipelines .
euroasia interconnector will electrically connect attica and crete in greece with cyprus and israel with *num* mw hvdc undersea power cable .
euroasia interconnector is specially important for isolated systems , like cyprus and crete .
crete is energetically isolated from mainland greece and hellenic republic covers for crete electricity costs difference of around €300 million per year .
greece has a tiered tax system based on progressive taxation .
greek law recognizes six categories of taxable income : immovable property , movable property ( investment ) , income from agriculture , business , employment , and income from professional activities .
greece's personal income tax rate , until recently , ranged from *num* % for annual incomes below €12 , *num* to *num* % for annual incomes over €100 , *num* .
under the new *num* tax reform , tax exemptions have been abolished .
also under the new austerity measures and among other changes , the personal income tax-free ceiling has been reduced to €5 , *num* per annum while further future changes , for example abolition of this ceiling , are already being planned .
greece's corporate tax dropped from *num* % in *num* to *num* % in *num* .
for *num* only , corporate tax will be at *num* % .
value added tax ( vat ) has gone up in *num* compared to *num* : *num* % as opposed to *num* % .
the lowest vat possible is *num* .
*num* % ( previously *num* .
*num* % ) for newspapers , periodicals and cultural event tickets , while a tax rate of *num* % ( from *num* % ) applies to certain service sector professions .
additionally , both employers and employees have to pay social contribution taxes , which apply at a rate of *num* % for white collar jobs and *num* .
*num* % for blue collar jobs , and are used for social insurance .
now ( *num* ) the vat tax rate is *num* % with minor exceptions , *num* % reduced for some basic foodstuffs which will be soon abolished and everything , as it seems , will soon go to *num* % in order to fight the phantom of tax evasion .
the ministry of finance expected tax revenues for *num* to be €52 .
*num* billion ( €23 .
*num* billion in direct taxes and €29 .
*num* billion in indirect taxes ) , an increase of *num* .
*num* % from *num* .
in *num* , the government was expected to have considerably higher tax revenues than in *num* on a number of sectors , primarily housing ( an increase of *num* .
*num* % from *num* ) .
greece suffers from very high levels of tax evasion .
in the last quarter of *num* , tax evasion reached *num* % , while in january *num* it fell to *num* .
*num* % .
it is worth noting that the newspaper ethnos which published these figures went bankrupt ; it is no longer published and some sources suggest that the information it had published was highly debatable .
a study by researchers from the university of chicago concluded that tax evasion in *num* by self-employed professionals alone in greece ( accountants , dentists , lawyers , doctors , personal tutors and independent financial advisers ) was €28 billion or *num* % of the budget deficit that year .
greece’s “shadow economy” was estimated at *num* .
*num* % of gdp in *num* , compared with *num* .
*num* % for estonia , *num* .
*num* % for latvia , *num* .
*num* % for italy , *num* .
*num* % for belgium , *num* .
*num* % for sweden , *num* .
*num* % for finland , and *num* .
*num* % for germany , and is certainly related to the fact that the percentage of greeks that are self-employed is more than double the eu average ( *num* est .
) .
the tax justice network estimated in *num* that there were over *num* billion euros in swiss bank accounts held by greeks .
the former finance minister of greece , evangelos venizelos , was quoted as saying , " around *num* , *num* individuals and companies owe the taxman *num* billion euros " .
additionally , the tjn put the number of greek-owned off-shore companies at over *num* , *num* .
in *num* , swiss estimates suggested that greeks had some *num* billion euros in switzerland of which only one percent had been declared as taxable in greece .
estimates in *num* were even more dramatic .
they indicated that the amount due to the government of greece from greeks ' accounts in swiss banks totaled around *num* billion euros .
a mid-2017 report indicated greeks have been " taxed to the hilt " and many believed that the risk of penalties for tax evasion were less serious than the risk of bankruptcy .
one method of evasion is the so-called black market , grey economy or shadow economy : work is done for cash payment which is not declared as income ; as well , vat is not collected and remitted .
a january *num* report by the dianeosis think-tank indicated that unpaid taxes in greece at the time totaled approximately *num* billion euros , up from *num* billion euros in *num* , much of it was expected to be uncollectable .
another early *num* study estimated that the loss to the government as a result of tax evasion was between *num* % and *num* % of the country's gdp , or roughly between *num* billion and *num* billion euros per annum .
the shortfall in the collection of vat ( sales tax ) is also significant .
in *num* , the government collected *num* % less than was owed to it ; this shortfall was about double the average for the eu .
the uncollected amount that year was about *num* .
*num* billion euros .
the dianeosis study estimated that *num* .
*num* % of gdp is lost due to vat fraud , while losses due to smuggling of alcohol , tobacco and petrol amounted to approximately another *num* .
*num* % of the country's gdp .
following similar actions by the united kingdom and germany , the greek government was in talks with switzerland in *num* , attempting to force swiss banks to reveal information on the back accounts of greek citizens .
the ministry of finance stated that greeks with swiss bank accounts would either be required to pay a tax or reveal information such as the identity of the bank account holder to the greek internal revenue services .
the greek and swiss governments were to reach a deal on the matter by the end of *num* .
the solution demanded by greece still had not been effected as of *num* .
that year , estimates indicated that the amount of evaded taxes stored in swiss banks was around *num* billion euros .
by then , however , a tax treaty to address this issue was under serious negotiation between the greek and swiss governments .
an agreement was finally ratified by switzerland on *num* march *num* creating a new tax transparency law that would allow for a more effective battle against tax evasion .
starting in *num* , banks in both greece and switzerland will exchange information about the bank accounts of citizens of the other country to minimize the possibility of hiding untaxed income .
in *num* and *num* , the government was encouraging the use of credit cards or debit cards to pay for goods and services in order to reduce cash only payments .
by january *num* , taxpayers were only granted tax-allowances or deductions when payments were made electronically , with a " paper trail " of the transactions that the government could easily audit .
this was expected to reduce the problem of businesses taking payments but not issuing an invoice ; that tactic had been used by various companies to avoid payment of vat ( sales ) tax as well as income tax .
by *num* july *num* , numerous businesses were required by law to install a point of sale device to enable them to accept payment by credit or debit card .
failure to comply with the electronic payment facility can lead to fines of up to *num* , *num* euros .
the requirement applied to around *num* , *num* firms or individuals in *num* professions .
the greater use of cards was one of the factors that had already achieved significant increases in vat collection in *num* .
greece's most economically important regions are attica , which contributed €85 .
*num* billion to the economy in *num* , and central macedonia , which contributed €24 .
*num* billion .
the smallest regional economies were those of the north aegean ( €2 .
*num* billion ) and ionian islands ( €3 .
*num* billion ) .
in terms of gdp per capita , attica ( €22 , *num* ) far outranks any other greek region .
the poorest regions in *num* were eastern macedonia and thrace ( €11 , *num* ) and epirus and the north aegean ( both €12 , *num* ) .
at the national level , gdp per capita in *num* was €16 , *num* .
greece is a welfare state which provides a number of social services such as quasi-universal health care and pensions .
in the *num* budget , expenses for the welfare state ( excluding education ) stand at an estimated €22 .
*num* billion ( €6 .
*num* billion for pensions and €15 .
*num* billion for social security and health care expenses ) , or *num* .
*num* % of the all state expenses .
according to the *num* forbes global *num* index , greece's largest publicly traded companies are : in *num* , *num* .
*num* percent of employed persons worked more than *num* to *num* hours a week and *num* .
*num* percent worked more than *num* hours a week , totaling up to *num* .
*num* percent of employed persons working *num* or more hours a week .
when accounting for varying age groups , the percentage of employees working *num* to *num* hours a week peaked in the *num* to *num* age range .
as workers got older , they gradually decreased in percentage working *num* to *num* hours , but increased in working 50+ hours , suggesting a correlation that as employees grow older , they work more hours .
of different occupation groups , skilled agricultural , forestry , and fishery workers and managers were the most likely to work 50+ hours ; however , they do not take up a significant portion of the labor force , only *num* .
*num* percent .
in *num* , the average number of working hours for greek employees was *num* hours , ranking as the third highest among oecd countries and the highest in the eurozone .
recent trends in employment indicate that the number of workings hours will decrease in the future due to the rise of part time work .
since *num* , average workings hours have decreased .
in *num* , greece passed legislation introducing part-time employment in public services with the goal of reducing unemployment , increasing the total , but decreasing the average number of hours worked per employee .
whether the legislation was successful in increasing public-sector part-time work , labor market trends show that part-time employment has increased from *num* .
*num* percent in *num* to *num* percent in *num* of total employment .
both men and women have had the part time share of employment increase over this period .
while women still constitute a majority of part-time workers , recently men have been taking a larger share of part-time employment .
between *num* and *num* the currency of greece was the drachma .
after signing the maastricht treaty , greece applied to join the eurozone .
the two main convergence criteria were a maximum budget deficit of *num* % of gdp and a declining public debt if it stood above *num* % of gdp .
greece met the criteria as shown in its *num* annual public account .
on *num* january *num* , greece joined the eurozone , with the adoption of the euro at the fixed exchange rate ₯340 .
*num* to €1 .
however , in *num* the euro only existed electronically , so the physical exchange from drachma to euro only took place on *num* january *num* .
this was followed by a ten-year period for eligible exchange of drachma to euro , which ended on *num* march *num* .
prior to the adoption of the euro , *num* % of greek citizens viewed the new currency positively , but in february *num* this figure fell to *num* % and by june *num* it fell further to *num* % .
since *num* the figure has risen again , and a survey in september *num* showed that *num* % of greek citizens viewed of the euro positively .
imf's forecast said that greece's unemployment rate would hit the highest *num* .
*num* percent in *num* and decrease to *num* .
*num* in *num* .
but in fact , the greek economy suffered a prolonged high unemployment .
the unemployment figure was between *num* per cent and *num* per cent in *num* , and it soared to *num* per cent in *num* .
in *num* , greece's jobless rate was around *num* .
*num* per cent .
it is thought that greece's potential output has been eroded by this prolonged massive unemployment due to the associated hysteresis effects .
greece has suffered from recession , massive public debt , and poverty has increased .
those living in extreme poverty rose to *num* % in *num* , up from *num* .
*num* % in *num* , and a huge increase from *num* when it was not more than *num* .
*num* % .
those people at risk for poverty or social exclusion are at *num* .
*num* % .
the rate among children 0-17 is *num* .
*num* % and for young people 18-29 the rate is *num* .
*num* % .
with unemployment on the rise , those without jobs are at the highest risk at 70-75 % , up from less than *num* % in *num* .
with jobs harder and harder to come by , a quarter of the population is out of work , and for people under *num* the rate is *num* % .
in some harder hit areas of western greece , the younger generation unemployment rate is more than *num* % .
when people are out of work for more than two years , they lose their health insurance , further increasing the problems of those in poverty .
when younger people are out of work , they rely on the older generations of their families to provide for them to get them through the hard times .
however , long term unemployment across the country causes pension funds to decrease because they are getting less money from the working population , so those older generations are getting less money to provide for the younger generations and their entire families , putting more of them in poverty .
many aspects of the economic problems add to the problem .
the greek people have continued job loss and wage cuts , as well as deep cuts in workers compensation and social welfare benefits .
for those who are working , their wages have dropped .
from *num* to *num* , greeks have become *num* % poorer on average , and in *num* saw their disposable household income drop below *num* levels .
the economic survey of greece *num* shows optimism in a stronger recovery in *num* by using things like the reforms in place and outside investment in jobs to help change the course of the high levels of poverty .

bagpipes bagpipes are a woodwind instrument using enclosed reeds fed from a constant reservoir of air in the form of a bag .
the scottish great highland bagpipes are the best known in the anglophone world ; however , bagpipes have been played for a millennium or more throughout large parts of europe , northern africa , and western asia , including turkey , the caucasus , and around the persian gulf .
the term " bagpipe " is equally correct in the singular or plural , though pipers usually refer to the bagpipes as " the pipes " , " a set of pipes " or " a stand of pipes " .
a set of bagpipes minimally consists of an air supply , a bag , a chanter , and usually at least one drone .
many bagpipes have more than one drone ( and , sometimes , more than one chanter ) in various combinations , held in place in stocks—sockets that fasten the various pipes to the bag .
the most common method of supplying air to the bag is through blowing into a blowpipe or blowstick .
in some pipes the player must cover the tip of the blowpipe with their tongue while inhaling , but most blowpipes have a non-return valve that eliminates this need .
in recent times , there are many instruments that assist in creating a clean air flow to the pipes and assist the collection of condensation .
an innovation , dating from the *ord* or *ord* century , is the use of a bellows to supply air .
in these pipes , sometimes called " cauld wind pipes " , air is not heated or moistened by the player's breathing , so bellows-driven bagpipes can use more refined or delicate reeds .
such pipes include the irish uilleann pipes ; the scottish border or lowland pipes ; northumbrian smallpipes , pastoral pipes and english border pipes in britain ; and the musette de cour , the musette bechonnet and the cabrette in france , the dudy wielkopolskie , koziol bialy and koziol czarny in poland .
the bag is an airtight reservoir that holds air and regulates its flow via arm pressure , allowing the player to maintain continuous even sound .
the player keeps the bag inflated by blowing air into it through a blowpipe or pumping air into it with a bellows .
materials used for bags vary widely , but the most common are the skins of local animals such as goats , dogs , sheep , and cows .
more recently , bags made of synthetic materials including gore-tex have become much more common .
a drawback of the synthetic bag is the potential for fungal spores to colonise the bag because of a reduction in necessary cleaning , with the associated danger of lung infection .
an advantage of a synthetic bag is that it has a zip which allows the user to fit a more effective moisture trap to the inside of the bag .
bags cut from larger materials are usually saddle-stitched with an extra strip folded over the seam and stitched ( for skin bags ) or glued ( for synthetic bags ) to reduce leaks .
holes are then cut to accommodate the stocks .
in the case of bags made from largely intact animal skins , the stocks are typically tied into the points where the limbs and the head joined the body of the whole animal , a construction technique common in central europe .
the chanter is the melody pipe , played with two hands .
almost all bagpipes have at least one chanter ; some pipes have two chanters , particularly those in north africa , in the balkans , and in southwest asia .
a chanter can be bored internally so that the inside walls are parallel ( or " cylindrical " ) for its full length , or it can be bored in a conical shape .
the chanter is usually open-ended , so there is no easy way for the player to stop the pipe from sounding .
thus most bagpipes share a constant , legato sound where there are no rests in the music .
primarily because of this inability to stop playing , technical movements are used to break up notes and to create the illusion of articulation and accents .
because of their importance , these embellishments ( or " ornaments " ) are often highly technical systems specific to each bagpipe , and take many years of study to master .
a few bagpipes ( such as the musette de cour , the uilleann pipes , the northumbrian smallpipes , the piva and the left chanter of the surdelina ) have closed ends or stop the end on the player's leg , so that when the player " closes " ( covers all the holes ) the chanter becomes silent .
a practice chanter is a chanter without bag or drones , allowing a player to practice the instrument quietly and with no variables other than playing the chanter .
the term " chanter " is derived from the latin " cantare " , or " to sing " , much like the modern french word " chanteur " .
the note from the chanter is produced by a reed installed at its top .
the reed may be a single ( a reed with one vibrating tongue ) or double reed ( of two pieces that vibrate against each other ) .
double reeds are used with both conical- and parallel-bored chanters while single reeds are generally ( although not exclusively ) limited to parallel-bored chanters .
in general , double-reed chanters are found in pipes of western europe while single-reed chanters appear in most other regions .
most bagpipes have at least one drone : a pipe which is generally not fingered but rather produces a constant harmonizing note throughout play ( usually the tonic note of the chanter ) .
exceptions are generally those pipes which have a double-chanter instead .
a drone is most commonly a cylindrically-bored tube with a single reed , although drones with double reeds exist .
the drone is generally designed in two or more parts with a sliding joint so that the pitch of the drone can be adjusted .
depending on the type of pipes , the drones may lie over the shoulder , across the arm opposite the bag , or may run parallel to the chanter .
some drones have a tuning screw , which effectively alters the length of the drone by opening a hole , allowing the drone to be tuned to two or more distinct pitches .
the tuning screw may also shut off the drone altogether .
in most types of pipes , where there is one drone it is pitched two octaves below the tonic of the chanter .
additional drones often add the octave below and then a drone consonant with the fifth of the chanter .
the evidence for pre-roman era bagpipes is still uncertain but several textual and visual clues have been suggested .
the " oxford history of music " says that a sculpture of bagpipes has been found on a hittite slab at euyuk in the middle east , dated to *num* bc .
several authors identify the ancient greek " askaulos " ( ἀσκός " askos " – wine-skin , αὐλός " aulos " – reed pipe ) with the bagpipe .
in the *ord* century ad , suetonius described the roman emperor nero as a player of the " tibia utricularis " .
dio chrysostom wrote in the *ord* century of a contemporary sovereign ( possibly nero ) who could play a pipe ( tibia , roman reedpipes similar to greek and etruscan instruments ) with his mouth as well as by tucking a bladder beneath his armpit .
in the early part of the second millennium , definite clear attestations of bagpipes began to appear with frequency in western european art and iconography .
the cantigas de santa maria , written in galician-portuguese and compiled in castile in the *ord* century , depicts several types of bagpipes .
several illustrations of bagpipes also appear in the " chronique dite de baudoin d’avesnes " , a 13th-century manuscript of northern french origin .
although evidence of bagpipes in the british isles prior to the *ord* century is contested , they are explicitly mentioned in " the canterbury tales " ( written around *num* ) : bagpipes were also frequent subjects for carvers of wooden choir stalls in the late *ord* and early *ord* century throughout europe , sometimes with animal musicians .
actual examples of bagpipes from before the *ord* century are extremely rare ; however , a substantial number of paintings , carvings , engravings , manuscript illuminations , and so on survive .
they make it clear that bagpipes varied hugely throughout europe , and even within individual regions .
many examples of early folk bagpipes in continental europe can be found in the paintings of brueghel , teniers , jordaens , and durer .
the first clear reference to the use of the scottish highland bagpipes is from a french history , which mentions their use at the battle of pinkie cleugh in *num* .
george buchanan ( 1506–82 ) claimed that they had replaced the trumpet on the battlefield .
this period saw the creation of the " ceòl mór " ( great music ) of the bagpipe , which reflected its martial origins , with battle-tunes , marches , gatherings , salutes and laments .
the highlands of the early seventeenth century saw the development of piping families including the maccrimmonds , macarthurs , macgregors and the mackays of gairloch .
evidence of the bagpipe in ireland occurs in *num* , when john derrick's " the image of irelande " clearly depicts a bagpiper .
derrick's illustrations are considered to be reasonably faithful depictions of the attire and equipment of the english and irish population of the *ord* century .
the " battell " sequence from " my ladye nevells booke " ( *num* ) by william byrd , which probably alludes to the irish wars of *num* , contains a piece entitled " the bagpipe : & the drone " .
in *num* , the first serious study of the scottish highland bagpipe and its music was attempted , in joseph macdonald's " compleat theory " .
further south , a manuscript from the 1730s by a william dixon from northumberland contains music that fits the border pipes , a nine-note bellows-blown bagpipe whose chanter is similar to that of the modern great highland bagpipe .
however the music in dixon's manuscript varied greatly from modern highland bagpipe tunes , consisting mostly of extended variation sets of common dance tunes .
some of the tunes in the dixon manuscript correspond to tunes found in early *ord* century published and manuscript sources of northumbrian smallpipe tunes , notably the rare book of *num* tunes , many with variations , by john peacock .
as western classical music developed , both in terms of musical sophistication and instrumental technology , bagpipes in many regions fell out of favour due to their limited range and function .
this triggered a long , slow decline that continued , in most cases , into the *ord* century .
extensive and documented collections of traditional bagpipes can be found in the metropolitan museum of art in new york city , the international bagpipe museum in gijón , spain , the pitt rivers museum in oxford , england and the morpeth chantry bagpipe museum in northumberland , and the musical instrument museum in phoenix , arizona .
the international bagpipe festival ( " mezinárodní dudácký festival " , ibf , mdf ) is held every two years in strakonice , czech republic .
during the expansion of the british empire , spearheaded by british military forces that included highland regiments , the scottish great highland bagpipe became well-known worldwide .
this surge in popularity was boosted by large numbers of pipers trained for military service in world war i and world war ii .
the surge coincided with a decline in the popularity of many traditional forms of bagpipe throughout europe , which began to be displaced by instruments from the classical tradition and later by gramophone and radio .
in the united kingdom and commonwealth nations such as canada , new zealand and australia the great highland bagpipe is commonly used in the military and is often played in formal ceremonies .
foreign militaries patterned after the british army have also taken the highland bagpipe into use including uganda , sudan , india , pakistan , sri lanka , jordan , and oman .
many police and fire services in scotland , canada , australia , new zealand , hong kong , and the united states have also adopted the tradition of fielding pipe bands .
in recent years , often driven by revivals of native folk music and dance , many types of bagpipes have enjoyed a resurgence in popularity and , in many cases , instruments that were on the brink of obscurity have become extremely popular .
in brittany , the great highland bagpipe and concept of the pipe band were appropriated to create a breton interpretation , the bagad .
the pipe band idiom has also been adopted and applied to the galician gaita as well .
additionally , bagpipes have often been used in various films depicting moments from scottish and irish history ; the film " braveheart " and the theatrical show " riverdance " have served to make the uilleann pipes more commonly known .
bagpipes are sometimes played at formal events in commonwealth universities , particularly in canada .
because of the scottish influences on the sport of curling , bagpipes are also the official instrument of the world curling federation and are commonly played during a ceremonial procession of teams before major curling championships .
bagpipe making was once a craft that produced instruments in many distinctive local traditional styles .
today , the world's biggest producer of the instrument is pakistan , where the industry was worth $6 .
*num* million in *num* .
in the late *ord* century , various models of electronic bagpipes were invented .
the first custom-built midi bagpipes were developed by the asturian piper known as hevia ( josé ángel hevia velasco ) .
dozens of types of bagpipes today are widely spread across europe and the middle east , as well as through much of the former british empire .
the name bagpipe has almost become synonymous with its best-known form , the great highland bagpipe , overshadowing the great number and variety of traditional forms of bagpipe .
despite the decline of these other types of pipes over the last few centuries , in recent years many of these pipes have seen a resurgence or revival as musicians have sought them out ; for example , the irish piping tradition , which by the mid *ord* century had declined to a handful of master players is today alive , well , and flourishing a situation similar to that of the asturian gaita , the galician gaita , the portuguese gaita transmontana , the aragonese gaita de boto , northumbrian smallpipes , the breton biniou , the balkan gaida , the romanian cimpoi , the black sea tulum , the scottish smallpipes and pastoral pipes , as well as other varieties .
traditionally , one of the purposes of the bagpipe was to provide music for dancing .
this has declined with the growth of dance bands , recordings , and the decline of traditional dance .
in turn , this has led to many types of pipes developing a performance-led tradition , and indeed much modern music based on the dance music tradition played on bagpipes is no longer suitable for use as dance music .
since the 1960s , bagpipes have also made appearances in other forms of music , including rock , metal , jazz , hip-hop , punk , and classical music , for example with paul mccartney's " mull of kintyre " , ac / dc's " it's a long way to the top ( if you wanna rock ' n ' roll ) " , and peter maxwell davies's composition " an orkney wedding , with sunrise " .
detroit tigers the detroit tigers are an american professional baseball team based in detroit , michigan .
the tigers compete in major league baseball ( mlb ) as a member of the american league ( al ) central division .
one of the al's eight charter franchises , the club was founded in detroit as a member of the minor league western league in *num* .
they are the oldest continuous one name , one city franchise in the al .
the tigers have won four world series championships ( , , , and ) , *num* al pennants ( *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* ) , and four al central division championships ( *num* , *num* , *num* , and *num* ) .
the tigers also won division titles in *num* , *num* , and *num* as a member of the al east .
the team currently plays its home games at comerica park in downtown detroit .
the tigers constructed bennett park at the corner of michigan avenue and trumbull avenue in corktown ( just west of downtown detroit ) and began playing there in *num* .
in *num* , the team moved into navin field , which was built on the same location .
it was expanded in *num* and renamed briggs stadium .
it was renamed tiger stadium in *num* and the tigers played there until moving to comerica park in *num* .
the franchise was founded as a member of the reorganized western league in *num* .
they originally played at boulevard park , sometimes called league park .
it was located on east lafayette , then called champlain street , between helen and east grand boulevard , near belle isle .
in *num* , owner george vanderbeck decided to build bennett park at the corner of michigan and trumbull avenues , which would remain their base of operations for the next *num* seasons .
the first game at the corner was an exhibition on april *num* , *num* .
the team , now occasionally called the " tigers , " beat a local semi-pro team , known as the athletics , by a score of 30–3 .
they played their first western league game at bennett park on april *num* , *num* , defeating the columbus senators 17–2 .
at the end of the *num* season , rube waddell was lent to the team to gain professional experience .
after being fined , waddell left detroit to pitch in canada .
when the western league renamed itself the american league for *num* , it was still a minor league , but the next year , it broke from the national agreement and declared itself a major league , openly competing with the national league for players and for fans in four contested cities .
for a while , there were rumors of the team relocating to pittsburgh , but the two leagues made peace in *num* when they signed a new national agreement .
the tigers were established as a charter member of the now major league american league in *num* .
they played their first game as a major league team at home against the milwaukee brewers on april *num* , *num* , with an estimated *num* , *num* fans at bennett park .
after entering the ninth inning behind 13–4 , the team staged a dramatic comeback to win 14–13 .
the team finished third in the eight-team league .
in *num* , the team acquired 18-year-old ty cobb , a fearless player with a mean streak , who came to be regarded as one of the greatest players of all time .
the addition of cobb to an already talented team that included sam crawford , hughie jennings , bill donovan and george mullin quickly yielded results .
behind the hitting of outfielders ty cobb ( .
*num* ) and sam crawford ( .
*num* ) , and the pitching of bill donovan and ed killian ( *num* wins each ) , the tigers went 92–58 to win the al pennant in *num* by *num* .
*num* games over the philadelphia athletics .
they moved on to their first world series appearance against the chicago cubs .
game *num* ended in a rare 3–3 tie , called due to darkness after *num* innings .
the tigers scored only three runs in the succeeding four games , never scoring more than one run in a game , and lost the series , 4–0 .
the tigers won the al by just a half-game over the 90–64 cleveland naps with a 90–63 record .
cobb hit .
*num* , while sam crawford hit .
*num* with *num* home runs , which was enough to lead the league in the " dead ball " era .
the cubs , however , would defeat the tigers again in the *num* world series , this time in five games .
this would be the cubs ' last world championship until *num* .
in *num* , detroit posted a 98–54 season , winning the al pennant by *num* .
*num* games over the athletics .
ty cobb won the batting triple crown in *num* , hitting .
*num* with *num* home runs ( all inside-the-park ) and *num* rbis .
he also led the league with *num* stolen bases .
george mullin was the pitching hero , going 29–8 with a *num* .
*num* era , while fellow pitcher ed willett went 21–10 .
mullin's 11–0 start in *num* was a tiger record for *num* years , finally being broken by max scherzer's 13–0 start in *num* .
it was hoped that a new opponent in the *num* series , the pittsburgh pirates , would yield different results .
the tigers performed better in the fall classic , taking pittsburgh to seven games , but they were blown out 8–0 in the decisive game at bennett park .
the tigers dropped to third place in the american league in *num* with an 86–68 record .
they posted *num* wins in *num* to finish second , but were still well behind a powerhouse philadelphia athletics team that won *num* games .
the team sunk to a dismal sixth place in both the *num* and *num* seasons .
a bright spot in *num* was george mullin pitching the franchise's first no-hitter in a 7–0 win over the st .
louis browns on july *num* , his *ord* birthday .
cobb went into the stands in a may *num* , *num* , game to attack a fan that was abusing him , and was suspended .
the tigers protested the suspension by fielding a team of replacement players and some coaches , and lost 24–2 , to the philadelphia athletics .
during this five-season stretch , cobb posted batting averages of .
*num* , .
*num* , .
*num* , .
*num* and .
*num* , winning the al batting title every year .
in *num* , the tigers won a then-club record *num* games , but narrowly lost the al pennant to the boston red sox , who won *num* games .
the *num* tigers were led by an outfield consisting of ty cobb , sam crawford , and bobby veach that finished #1 , #2 , and #3 in rbis and total bases .
cobb also set a stolen base record with *num* steals in *num* that stood until *num* , when it was broken by maury wills .
baseball historian bill james has ranked the *num* tigers outfield as the greatest in the history of baseball .
the only team in tigers ' history with a better winning percentage than the *num* squad was the *num* team that lost the world series to the st .
louis cardinals .
the tigers dropped to third place in *num* with an 87–67 record , and would remain mired in the middle of the al standings the rest of the decade , never winning more than *num* games .
in the late teens and into the 1920s , cobb continued to be the marquee player , though he was pushed by budding star outfielder harry heilmann , who went on to hit .
*num* for his career .
hughie jennings left the tigers after the *num* season , having accumulated *num* , *num* wins as a manager .
this stood as a tiger record until *num* , when it was broken by sparky anderson .
cobb himself took over managerial duties in *num* , but during his six years at the helm , the tigers topped out at *num* wins and never won a pennant .
in *num* , the tigers amassed *num* , *num* hits and a team batting average of .
*num* , the highest team hit total and batting average in al history .
that year , outfielders harry heilmann and ty cobb finished #1 and #2 in the american league batting race with batting averages of .
*num* and .
*num* , respectively .
the downfall of the *num* tigers , however , was the absence of good pitching .
the team era was *num* .
*num* .
without pitching to support the offense , the *num* tigers finished in sixth place in the american league at 71–82 , *num* games behind the new york yankees .
on august *num* , *num* , cobb collected his *num* , *ord* career hit off elmer myers of the boston red sox .
aged *num* at the time , he is still the youngest player to reach that milestone , also reaching it in the fewest at-bats ( *num* , *num* ) .
the tigers continued to field good teams during ty cobb's tenure as player-manager , finishing as high as second in *num* , but lack of quality pitching kept them from winning a pennant .
harry heilmann hit .
*num* in *num* , becoming the last al player to top .
*num* until ted williams hit .
*num* in *num* .
in *num* , heilmann collected six hits in a season-ending doubleheader to win the batting title , finishing at .
*num* to tris speaker's .
*num* .
cobb announced his retirement in november *num* after *num* seasons with the tigers , though he would return to play two more seasons with the philadelphia athletics .
though the tigers struggled with mediocre records in the seven years following cobb's departure , they were building a solid foundation , adding slugging first baseman hank greenberg and pitchers tommy bridges and schoolboy rowe to a lineup that already included second baseman charlie gehringer .
in *num* , harry heilmann flirted with a .
*num* batting average all year , eventually finishing at .
*num* and winning his fourth al batting title .
following the *num* season , the tigers added perhaps the final piece of the puzzle , acquiring catcher mickey cochrane from the philadelphia athletics to serve as player-manager .
the tigers won the *num* al pennant with a 101–53 record , at the time a team record for wins , and still the best win percentage ( .
*num* ) in team history .
the tigers infield ( hank greenberg and charlie gehringer , along with shortstop billy rogell and third baseman marv owen ) accumulated *num* runs during the season , with gehringer ( *num* hits , .
*num* average ) leading the way .
schoolboy rowe led a strong pitching staff , winning *num* straight decisions at one point of the season and finishing with a 24–8 record .
the tigers would fall in the *num* world series in seven games to the " gashouse gang " st .
louis cardinals .
after winning a tight battle in game *num* with a 3–1 decision over dizzy dean , detroit took a 3–2 series lead , but would lose the next two games at navin field ( tiger stadium ) .
for the second time in a world series game *num* , detroit folded .
st .
louis scored seven times in the third inning off starter elden auker and a pair of relievers , while dean baffled the tiger hitters en route to an 11–0 victory .
the final game was marred by an ugly incident .
after spiking tiger third baseman marv owen in the sixth inning , the cardinals ' joe medwick had to be removed from the game for his own safety by commissioner kenesaw mountain landis after being pelted with debris from angry fans in the large temporary bleacher section in left field .
the tigers *num* lineup featured four future hall of famers ( hank greenberg , mickey cochrane , goose goslin and charlie gehringer ) .
though they didn't challenge the *num* team's *num* wins , their 93–58 record was good enough to give them the al pennant by three games over the new york yankees .
greenberg was named al mvp after hitting .
*num* and leading the league in home runs ( *num* ) , extra-base hits ( *num* ) and rbis ( *num* ) .
incredibly , greenberg's rbi total was *num* higher than the next closest player ( lou gehrig , with *num* ) .
the tigers also got strong contributions from gehringer ( .
*num* ) , cochrane ( .
*num* ) and starting pitchers tommy bridges ( 21–10 ) and elden auker ( 18–7 ) .
the tigers finally won their first world series , defeating the chicago cubs , 4–2 .
game *num* concluded with goslin's dramatic walk-off rbi single , scoring cochrane for a 4–3 victory .
after owner frank navin died in the offseason , walter briggs sr .
took over control of the team .
despite being forecast to win the american league pennant again in *num* , the tigers fell to a distant second place behind the new york yankees both that season and in *num* .
the team fell further down the standings with an 84–70 record in *num* and an 81–73 record in *num* .
hank greenberg nevertheless provided some excitement for tiger fans in *num* by challenging the single season home run record held by babe ruth ( *num* ) .
he went into the season's final weekend against the cleveland indians with *num* home runs , tied with jimmie foxx for the most by a right-handed batter at the time , but he failed to homer .
during the final week of the *num* season , the tigers presciently held out doubts about a pennant in *num* , but figured that *num* would be their year .
in a tight three-team race , the 90–64 tigers won the *num* al pennant by one game over the cleveland indians and two games over the new york yankees .
prior to the season , first baseman hank greenberg was persuaded to move to left field to make room for rudy york .
the move proved successful .
york hit .
*num* with *num* home runs and *num* rbis .
greenberg batted .
*num* and slammed *num* home runs while driving in *num* .
greenberg won his second al mvp award , becoming the first major leaguer to win the award at two different positions .
charlie gehringer batted .
*num* while collecting *num* walks and scoring *num* runs .
bobo newsom was the ace of the tiger pitching staff in *num* , going 21–5 with a *num* .
*num* era .
an unlikely hero on the mound this season was 30-year-old rookie floyd giebell .
making just his third major league start on september *num* , giebell was called upon to pitch the pennant-clinching game against bob feller of the indians .
feller surrendered just three hits , one being a 2-run homer by rudy york , while giebell blanked the tribe for a 2–0 victory .
the tigers lost the *num* world series to the cincinnati reds in seven games .
despite a heroic effort by bobo newsom , the tigers came up short in the deciding game , losing 2–1 .
newsom's father had died in a cincinnati hotel room after watching his son win game *num* .
an inspired newsom won game *num* and pitched game *num* on just one day's rest .
this was the third time the tigers had lost a world series in a deciding seventh game .
with hank greenberg serving in world war ii for all or parts of the 1941–44 seasons , the tigers struggled to recapture the glory of *num* .
they finished no higher than fifth place in 1941–43 , but did manage a second-place finish in *num* , largely on the strength of pitchers hal newhouser and dizzy trout , who won *num* and *num* games , respectively .
newhouser , who was 29–9 with a *num* .
*num* era , won the first of his two consecutive al mvp awards this season .
the tigers were in first place as late as september *num* , but would finish one game behind the st .
louis browns for the al pennant .
with the end of world war ii and the timely return of hank greenberg and others from the military , the tigers won the al pennant by just *num* .
*num* games over the washington senators with an 88–65 record .
hal newhouser became the first pitcher in the history of the al ( and still the only pitcher as of *num* ) to win the mvp award in two consecutive seasons .
newhouser won the pitching triple crown , leading the al in wins ( *num* ) , era ( *num* .
*num* ) and strikeouts ( *num* ) .
with newhouser , virgil trucks and dizzy trout on the mound and greenberg leading the tiger bats , detroit responded in a world series game *num* for the first time , staking newhouser to a 5–0 lead before he threw a pitch en route to a 9–3 victory over the cubs .
because many stars had not yet returned from the military , some baseball scholars have deemed the *num* world series to be among the worst-played contests in world series history .
for example , prior to the world series , chicago sportswriter warren brown was asked who he liked , and he answered , " i don't think either one of them can win .
" following their world series win in *num* , the tigers continued to have winning records for the remainder of the decade , finishing second in the al three times , but never winning the pennant .
during the *num* season , the tigers acquired george kell , a third baseman who was a 10-time all-star and future hall of famer .
he batted over .
*num* in eight straight seasons ( 1946–53 ) , and finished with a career .
*num* average .
kell won the batting title in a very close race with ted williams in *num* , going 2-for-3 on the last day of the season to edge out the red sox slugger , .
*num* to .
*num* .
the *num* season was particularly frustrating , as the tigers posted a 95–59 record for a .
*num* winning percentage , the fourth best in team history at the time .
however , they finished that season three games behind a strong new york yankees team that went on to sweep the philadelphia phillies in the world series .
over the next *num* years , the tigers sank to the middle and lower ranks of the american league .
the team had only three winning records over this span and never finished higher than fourth place .
the last place *num* team went 50–104 ( .
*num* ) , which was the worst season in tigers history until the *num* team lost *num* games .
despite the dismal season , starter virgil trucks threw two no-hitters , becoming only the third pitcher in major league history to accomplished this feat .
also , team owner walter briggs sr .
died in *num* .
his son walter briggs jr .
inherited the team , but he was forced to sell it in *num* to broadcast media owners john fetzer and fred knorr .
notwithstanding detroit's fall in the standings , the decade saw the debut of outfielder al kaline in *num* .
one of the few major league players who never played a day in the minor leagues , he would hit over .
*num* nine times in his career .
he also made *num* all-star teams , won *num* gold gloves , and featured one of the league's best arms in right field .
in *num* , the 20-year-old kaline hit .
*num* to become the youngest-ever batting champion in major league history .
*num* saw the tigers become the second to last team to integrate their roster when dominican player ozzie virgil sr .
joined the team .
only the boston red sox trailed the tigers in integrating their roster .
as the american league expanded from *num* to *num* teams , detroit began its slow ascent back to success with an outstanding *num* campaign .
the tigers won *num* games , a whopping 30-game improvement over the 71–83 *num* team , but still finished eight games behind the yankees .
this marked one of the few times in major league history that a team failed to reach the postseason despite winning *num* or more games , though it had happened once before to the tigers in *num* .
first baseman norm cash won the batting title with a .
*num* average , while teammate al kaline finished second .
cash never hit over .
*num* before or after the *num* season , and would later say of the accomplishment : " it was a freak .
even at the time , i realized that .
" cash's plate heroics , which also included *num* home runs and *num* rbi , might have earned him mvp honors were it not for new york's roger maris bashing a then record *num* homers the same season .
cash also drew *num* walks for a league-leading .
*num* on-base percentage .
the *num* club featured two non-white starters , bill bruton and jake wood , and later in the 1960s , black players such as willie horton , earl wilson , and gates brown would contribute to detroit's rise in the standings .
as a strong nucleus developed , detroit repeatedly posted winning records throughout the 1960s .
in *num* , pitchers mickey lolich and denny mclain entered the rotation .
outfielders willie horton ( *num* ) , mickey stanley ( *num* ) and jim northrup ( *num* ) would also came aboard around this time .
the team managed a third-place finish during a bizarre *num* season , in which manager chuck dressen and acting manager bob swift were both forced to resign their posts because of health problems .
thereafter , frank skaff took over the managerial reins until the end of the season .
both dressen and swift died during the year ; dressen died of a heart attack in august , while swift died of lung cancer in october .
following the season , the tigers hired mayo smith to be their new manager .
in *num* , the tigers were involved in one of the closest pennant races in history .
because of rainouts , the tigers were forced to play back-to-back doubleheaders against the california angels over the final two days of the season .
they needed to sweep the doubleheader on the last day of the season to force a one-game playoff with the boston red sox .
the tigers won the first game , but lost the second , giving the red sox the pennant with no playoff .
detroit finished the season at 91–71 , one game behind boston .
starter earl wilson , acquired the previous season from the red sox , led the tigers ( and the major leagues ) with *num* wins and would form a strong 1–2–3 combination with denny mclain and mickey lolich over the next few years .
the tigers finally returned to the world series in *num* .
the team grabbed first place from the baltimore orioles on may *num* and would not relinquish the position , clinching the pennant on september *num* and finishing with a 103–59 record .
in a year that was marked by dominant pitching , starter denny mclain went 31–6 ( with a *num* .
*num* era ) , the first time a pitcher had won *num* or more games in a season since dizzy dean accomplished the feat in *num* ; no pitcher has accomplished it since .
mclain won the al mvp and cy young award for his efforts .
in the *num* world series , the tigers met the defending world series champion st .
louis cardinals , led by starter bob gibson , who had posted a modern-era record *num* .
*num* era during the regular season , and speedy outfielder lou brock .
this was the first time the tigers and cardinals had met in the world series since *num* .
the series was predicated with a bold decision by manager mayo smith to play center fielder mickey stanley at shortstop , replacing the slick fielding but weak hitting of ray oyler .
stanley had never played shortstop before , but was a gold glover in the outfield and an excellent athlete .
smith started him at short for the final six games of the regular season and all seven world series games , with oyler only appearing as a late-inning defensive replacement .
this allowed smith to play an outfield of willie horton , jim northrup and al kaline in every game .
in game *num* , gibson completely shut down the detroit lineup , striking out a world series record *num* batters en route to an easy 4–0 win .
however , due in no small part to pitcher mickey lolich's victories in games *num* and *num* , the tigers climbed back into the world series .
many fans believe the turning point came in the fifth inning of game *num* , with the tigers down three games to one , and trailing in the game , 3–2 .
left fielder willie horton made a perfect throw to home plate to nail lou brock , who tried to score from second base standing up , as catcher bill freehan blocked the plate with his foot .
the tigers came back with three runs in the seventh to win that game , 5–3 , and stay alive .
the cardinals would not threaten to score the rest of this game , and scored only two more meaningless runs over the remainder of the series .
in game *num* , mclain ensured a game *num* by notching his only win of the world series , a 13–1 blowout , despite pitching on only two days ' rest .
in game *num* at busch memorial stadium , lolich , also pitching on two days ' rest , faced gibson .
both men pitched brilliantly , putting zeros up on the scoreboard for much of the game .
in the bottom of the sixth inning , the cardinals looked primed to take the lead as lou brock singled to lead off the inning , only to be promptly picked off by lolich .
one out later , curt flood followed with another single , and was also picked off by lolich .
in the top of the seventh , an exhausted gibson finally cracked , giving up two-out singles to norm cash and willie horton .
jim northrup then struck the decisive blow , lashing a triple to center field over the head of flood , who appeared to misjudge how hard the ball was hit .
that scored both cash and horton ; northrup himself was then brought home by a bill freehan double .
detroit added an insurance run in the ninth .
a solo home run by mike shannon was all the cardinals could muster against lolich as the tigers took the game , 4–1 , and the world series , 4–3 .
the tigers became only the third team to ever win the world series after being down 3–1 .
for his three victories that propelled the tigers to the championship , lolich was named the world series most valuable player .
through *num* , lolich is the last pitcher to have three complete-game victories in a single world series .
*num* saw further expansion as both leagues realigned into two divisions of six teams , and the tigers were placed in the american league east .
that year , detroit failed to defend its title , despite denny mclain having another outstanding season with a 24–9 campaign , earning him his second straight cy young award ( co-winner with baltimore's mike cuellar ) .
the tigers ' *num* wins placed them a distant second in the division to a very strong baltimore orioles team , which had won *num* games .
the tigers suffered a disappointing *num* season , finishing fourth in the al east with a 79–83 record .
following the season , mayo smith was let go and was replaced by billy martin .
in a playing career that was primarily spent with the new york yankees , martin played his final games with the minnesota twins and stayed in that organization after his retirement .
he managed the twins to an al west division title in *num* , but was fired after that season due to rocky relationships with his players which included a legendary fight with pitcher dave boswell in an alley behind detroit's lindell ac sports bar .
also during the offseason , denny mclain , who had been suspended three times and had a 3–5 record , was part of an eight-player deal with the washington senators in what would turn out to be a heist for detroit .
the tigers acquired pitcher joe coleman , shortstop eddie brinkman and third baseman aurelio rodríguez .
martin's tigers posted *num* wins in *num* .
however , they had to settle for a second-place finish behind the orioles , who won *num* games to take their third straight al east division crown .
the season was highlighted by mickey lolich's *num* strikeouts , which led the al and is still the single-season record in franchise history .
lolich also won *num* games and posted a *num* .
*num* era while throwing an incredible *num* innings and completing *num* of his *num* starts .
coleman paid immediate dividends for detroit , winning *num* games , while mclain went 10–22 for the senators and was out of baseball by age *num* .
joe coleman , eddie brinkman and aurelio rodríguez all played critical roles in *num* , when the tigers captured their first al east division title .
oddities of the schedule due to an early-season strike allowed the 86-70 tigers to win the division by just *num* game .
brinkman was named tiger of the year by the detroit baseball writers , despite a .
*num* batting average , as he committed just *num* errors in *num* chances ( .
*num* fielding percentage ) and had a 72-game errorless streak during the season .
mickey lolich was his steady self for the tigers , winning *num* games with a sparkling *num* .
*num* era , while coleman won *num* and had a *num* .
*num* era .
starter woodie fryman , acquired on august *num* , was the final piece of the puzzle as he went 10–3 over the last two months of the regular season and posted a minuscule *num* .
*num* era .
fryman was also the winning pitcher in the division-clinching game against the boston red sox , a 3–1 victory on october *num* .
in the *num* american league championship series , detroit faced the american league west division champion oakland athletics , who had become steadily competitive ever since the *num* realignment .
in game *num* of the alcs in oakland , mickey lolich , the hero of ' *num* , took the hill and allowed just one run over nine innings .
the athletics ' ace , catfish hunter , matched lolich , surrendering only a solo home run to norm cash , and the game went into extra innings .
al kaline hit a solo homer to break a 1–1 tie in the top of the *ord* inning , only to be charged with a throwing error on gonzalo marquez's game-tying single in the bottom half of the frame that allowed gene tenace to score the winning run .
blue moon odom shut down detroit 5–0 in game *num* .
the end of game *num* was marred by an ugly incident in which tiger reliever lerrin lagrow hit a's shortstop and leadoff hitter bert campaneris on the ankle with a pitch .
an angered campaneris threw the bat at lagrow , and lagrow ducked just in time for the bat to sail over his head .
both benches cleared , and though no punches were thrown , both lagrow and campaneris were suspended for the remainder of the series .
it was widely believed that martin had ordered the pitch that hit campaneris , who had three hits , two stolen bases and two runs scored in the game .
as the series shifted to detroit , the tigers caught their stride .
joe coleman held the a's scoreless on seven hits in game *num* , striking out *num* batters in a 3–0 victory for the tigers .
game *num* was another pitchers ' duel between hunter and lolich , resulting again in a 1–1 tie at the end of nine innings .
oakland scored two runs in the top of the *ord* and put the tigers down to their last three outs .
detroit pushed two runs across the plate to tie the game before jim northrup came through in the clutch again .
his single off dave hamilton scored gates brown to give the tigers a 4-3 win and even the series at two games apiece .
a first-inning run on an rbi ground out from bill freehan , set up by a gene tenace passed ball that allowed dick mcauliffe to reach third , gave detroit an early lead in the deciding fifth and final game in detroit .
reggie jackson's steal of home in the second inning tied it up , though jackson was injured in a collision with freehan and had to leave the game .
tenace's two-out single to left field plated george hendrick to give oakland a 2–1 lead in the fourth inning .
the run was controversial to many tiger fans , as hendrick was ruled safe at first base two batters prior to the tenace hit .
hendrick appeared to be out by two steps on a grounder to short , but umpire john rice ruled that norm cash pulled his foot off first base .
replays and photos , however , show that cash did not pull his foot .
thanks to that play and four innings of scoreless relief from vida blue , the a's took the al pennant and a spot in the world series .
the *num* season saw the tigers drop to third place in the division , with an 85–77 record .
joe coleman posted another *num* wins , but the other tiger starters had subpar seasons .
willie horton hit .
*num* , but injuries limited him to just *num* games .
jim northrup posted the best batting average of his career ( .
*num* ) but was inexplicably limited to part-time duty ( *num* games played ) , which northrup attributed to an ongoing feud with billy martin that had actually started in the *num* alcs .
northrup even proclaimed to the press that martin " took the fun out of the game .
" martin did not survive the *num* season as manager .
he was fired that september after ordering his pitchers to throw spitballs ( and telling the press that he did so ) in protest of opposing cleveland indians pitcher gaylord perry , whom martin was convinced was doing the same .
third base coach joe schultz served as interim manager for the reminder of the season .
a bright spot for the tigers in *num* was relief pitcher john hiller , who marked his first full season since suffering a heart attack in *num* by collecting a league-leading *num* saves and posting a brilliant *num* .
*num* era .
hiller's saves total would stand as a tiger record until *num* , when it was broken by todd jones ' *num* saves ( jones ' record would later be broken by josé valverde's *num* saves in *num* ) .
after the season , the tigers hired ralph houk to be their new manager .
houk served in that capacity for five full seasons , through the end of the *num* season .
the roster of players who played under houk were mostly aging veterans from the 1960s , whose performance had slipped from their peak years .
the tigers did not have a winning season from *num* to *num* , and their *num* wins in the *num* season was the team's lowest since *num* .
perhaps the biggest signal of decline for the tigers was the retirement of kaline following the *num* season , after he notched his *num* , *ord* career hit .
kaline finished with *num* , *num* hits and was elected to the baseball hall of fame in his first year of eligibility in *num* .
tiger fans were provided a glimmer of hope when 21-year-old rookie mark fidrych made his debut in *num* .
fidrych , known as " the bird " , was a colorful character known for talking to the baseball and other eccentricities .
during a game against the yankees , graig nettles responded to fidrych's antics by talking to his bat .
after making an out , he later lamented that his japanese-made bat didn't understand him .
fidrych entered the all-star break at 9–2 with a *num* .
*num* era , and was the starting pitcher for the american league in the all-star game played that year in philadelphia to celebrate the american bicentennial .
he finished the season with a record of 19–9 and an american league-leading era of *num* .
*num* .
fidrych , the al rookie of the year , was one of the few bright spots that year with the tigers finishing next to last in the al east in *num* .
aurelio rodríguez won the gold glove award in *num* at third base , snapping a streak in which hall of famer brooks robinson had won it for *num* consecutive seasons .
injuries to his knee , and later his arm , drastically limited fidrych's appearances in 1977–78 .
perhaps more important , however , was the talent coming up through the tigers farm system at the time .
jack morris , lance parrish , alan trammell and lou whitaker all made their debuts in *num* , and would help the team to *num* wins in *num* , the only winning season under houk .
houk's immediate successor as tiger manager in *num* was les moss , but moss would only last until june of that year .
from june *num* , *num* until the end of the *num* season , the team was managed by george " sparky " anderson , one of baseball's winningest managers and owner of two world series rings as manager of the cincinnati reds during their peak as the big red machine .
when anderson joined the tigers in *num* and assessed the team's young talent , he boldly predicted that it would be a pennant winner within *num* years .
acerbic sports anchor al ackerman initiated the phrase " bless you boys " .
originally used as a sarcastic remark , ackerman's phrase would take on a new meaning in *num* .
as in *num* , the tigers ' next world series season would be preceded by a disappointing second-place finish , as the *num* tigers won *num* games to finish six games behind the baltimore orioles in the al east .
the first major news of the *num* season actually came in late *num* , when broadcasting magnate john fetzer , who had owned the tigers since *num* , sold the team to domino's pizza founder and ceo tom monaghan for $53 million .
the *num* team got off to a 9–0 start highlighted by jack morris tossing a nationally televised no-hitter against chicago in the fourth game of the season .
they stayed hot for most of the year , posting a 35–5 record over their first forty games and cruising to a franchise-record *num* victories .
the tigers led the division from opening day until the end of the regular season and finished a staggering *num* games ahead of the second-place toronto blue jays .
closer willie hernández , acquired from the *num* nl champion philadelphia phillies in the offseason , won both the cy young award and al mvp , a rarity for a relief pitcher .
the tigers faced the kansas city royals in the american league championship series .
in game *num* , alan trammell , lance parrish and larry herndon went deep to crush the royals 8–1 at royals stadium ( now kauffman stadium ) .
in game *num* , the tigers scored twice in the *ord* inning when johnny grubb doubled off royals closer dan quisenberry en route to a 5–3 victory .
the tigers completed the sweep at tiger stadium in game *num* .
marty castillo's third-inning rbi fielder's choice would be all the help detroit would need .
milt wilcox outdueled charlie leibrandt , and after hernandez got darryl motley to pop out to preserve the 1–0 win , the tigers were returning to the world series .
in the nlcs , the san diego padres rallied from losing the first two games to overcome the chicago cubs and prevent a fifth cubs-tigers series .
tigers would open the *num* world series on the road in san diego .
in game *num* , larry herndon hit a two-run home run that gave the tigers a 3–2 lead .
jack morris pitched a complete game with *num* runs on *num* hits , and detroit drew first blood .
the padres evened the series the next night despite pitcher ed whitson being chased after pitching *num* of an inning and giving up three runs on five tiger hits .
tiger starter dan petry exited the game after innings when kurt bevacqua's three-run homer gave san diego a 5–3 lead they would hold onto .
when the series shifted to the motor city , the tigers took command .
in game *num* , a two-out rally in the second inning , highlighted by marty castillo's 2-run homer , led to four runs and the yanking of padre starter tim lollar after innings .
the padres never recovered , losing 5–2 .
eric show continued the parade of bad outings in game *num* , getting bounced after innings upon giving up home runs to world series mvp alan trammell in his first two at-bats .
trammell's homers held up with the help of another morris complete game , and the tigers ' 4–2 win gave them a commanding lead in the series .
in game *num* , kirk gibson's two-run shot in the first inning would be the beginning of another early end for the padres ' starter mark thurmond .
though the padres would pull back even at 3–3 , chasing petry in the fourth inning in the process , the tigers retook the lead on a rusty kuntz sacrifice fly ( actually a pop-out to retreating second baseman alan wiggins that the speedy gibson was able to score on ) , and then went up 5–3 on a solo homer by parrish .
a " sounds of the game " video was made during the series by mlb productions and played on tv a number of times since then .
gibson came to bat in the eighth inning with runners on second and third and the tigers clinging to a 5–4 lead .
padres manager dick williams was shown in the dugout flashing four fingers , ordering an intentional walk , before san diego reliever goose gossage summoned him to the mound .
sparky anderson was seen and heard yelling to gibson , " he don't want to walk you ! " , and making a swing-the-bat gesture .
as anderson had suspected , gossage threw a 1–0 fastball on the inside corner , and gibson was ready .
he launched the pitch into tiger stadium's right field upper deck for a three-run homer , effectively clinching the game and the series .
aurelio lópez pitched innings of relief and retired all seven batters he faced , earning the win .
despite allowing a rare run in the top of the *ord* inning , willie hernández got the save as tony gwynn flew out to larry herndon to end the game , sending detroit into a wild victory celebration .
the tigers led their division wire-to-wire , from opening day and every day thereafter , culminating in the world series championship .
this had not been done in the major leagues since the *num* brooklyn dodgers .
with the win , anderson became the first manager to win the world series in both leagues .
after a pair of third-place finishes in *num* and *num* , the *num* tigers faced lowered expectations – which seemed to be confirmed by an 11–19 start to the season .
however , the team hit its stride thereafter and gradually gained ground on its al east rivals .
this charge was fueled in part by the acquisition of pitcher doyle alexander from the atlanta braves in exchange for minor league pitcher john smoltz .
alexander started *num* games for the tigers , posting a 9–0 record and a *num* .
*num* era .
smoltz , a michigan native , went on to have a long and productive career , mostly with the braves , and was ultimately inducted into the baseball hall of fame in *num* .
despite the tigers ' great season , they entered september neck-and-neck with the toronto blue jays .
the two teams would square off in seven hard-fought games during the final two weeks of the season .
all seven games were decided by one run , and in the first six of the seven games , the winning run was scored in the final inning of play .
at exhibition stadium , the tigers dropped three in a row to the blue jays before winning a dramatic extra-inning showdown .
the tigers entered the final week of the *num* season *num* .
*num* games behind .
after a series against the baltimore orioles , the tigers returned home trailing by a game and swept the blue jays .
detroit clinched the division in a 1–0 victory over toronto in front of *num* , *num* fans at tiger stadium on october *num* .
frank tanana went all nine innings for the complete game shutout , and outfielder larry herndon gave the tigers their lone run on a second-inning home run .
detroit finished the season two games ahead of toronto , securing the best record in the majors ( 98–64 ) .
in what would prove to be their last postseason appearance until *num* , the tigers were upset in the *num* american league championship series by the 85–77 minnesota twins ( who in turn won the world series that year ) 4–1 .
the twins clinched the series in game *num* at tiger stadium , 9–5 .
despite their *num* division title victory , the tigers proved unable to build on their success .
the team lost kirk gibson to free agency in the offseason , but still spent much of *num* in first place in the al east .
a late season slump left the team in second place at 88–74 , one game behind the boston red sox .
in *num* , the team collapsed to a 59–103 record , worst in the majors .
the franchise then attempted to rebuild using a power-hitting approach , with sluggers cecil fielder , rob deer and mickey tettleton joining trammell and whitaker in the lineup ( fitting for the team with the most 200+ home run seasons in baseball history ) .
in *num* , fielder led the american league with *num* home runs ( becoming the first player to hit *num* since george foster in *num* , and the first al player since roger maris and mickey mantle in *num* ) , and finished second in the voting for al mvp .
he hit *num* home runs and collected *num* rbi in *num* , again finishing second in the al mvp balloting .
behind the hitting of fielder and others , the tigers improved by *num* wins in *num* ( 79–83 ) , and posted a winning record in *num* ( 84–78 ) .
however , the team lacked quality pitching , despite bill gullickson's *num* wins in *num* , and its core of key players began to age , setting the franchise up for decline .
their minor league system was largely barren of talent as well , producing only a few everyday players during the 1990s .
adding insult to injury , the tigers and radio station wjr announced in december *num* , that they were not renewing the contract of long-time hall of fame play-by play announcer ernie harwell , and that the *num* season would be harwell's last with the team .
the announcement was met with resounding protests from fans , both in michigan and around the baseball world .
*num* saw the tigers win only *num* games , with fielder being one of the few bright spots as he won the al rbi title for a third straight season ( *num* ) .
in august *num* , the franchise was sold to mike ilitch , the president and ceo of little caesars pizza who also owns the detroit red wings .
one of ilitch's first priorities as the new owner was to rehire ernie harwell .
late in the season , sparky anderson won his *num* , *ord* game as a tiger manager , passing hughie jennings for the most all-time wins in franchise history .
the team also responded with an 85–77 season in *num* , but it would be their last winning season for a number of years .
on october *num* , *num* , manager sparky anderson chose to not only end his career with the tigers , but retire from baseball altogether .
from *num* to *num* , the tigers did not post a winning record , the longest sub- .
*num* stretch in franchise history .
in *num* , the tigers lost a then-team record *num* games , under new general manager randy smith .
the only team in the majors to have a longer stretch without a winning season during this time were the pittsburgh pirates , who didn't have a winning record in the years spanning *num* to *num* .
the tigers ' best record over this span was 79–83 , recorded in *num* and *num* .
in *num* , the tigers moved from the al east , where they had been since the divisions were created in *num* , to the al central as part of a realignment necessitated by the addition of the expansion tampa bay devil rays .
in *num* , the team left tiger stadium in favor of comerica park .
soon after it opened , comerica park drew criticism for its deep dimensions , which made it difficult to hit home runs ; the distance to left-center field ( *num* ft ) , in particular , was seen as unfair to hitters .
this led to the nickname " comerica national park .
" the team made a successful bid to bring in slugger juan gonzález from the texas rangers for the inaugural season at comerica park .
after four consecutive seasons of no fewer than *num* home runs , gonzález only hit *num* homers in *num* .
he cited comerica park's dimensions as a major reason why he turned down a multiyear contract extension .
in *num* , the franchise largely quieted the criticism by moving in the left-center fence to , taking the flagpole in that area out of play , a feature carried over from tiger stadium .
in *num* , the team moved the bullpens to the vacant area beyond the left field fence and filled the previous location with seats .
in late *num* , dave dombrowski , former general manager of the *num* world series champion florida marlins , was hired as team president .
in *num* , the tigers started the season 0–6 , prompting dombrowski to fire the unpopular smith , as well as manager phil garner .
dombrowski then took over as general manager and named bench coach luis pujols to finish the season as interim manager .
the team finished 55–106 .
after the season was over , pujols was let go .
dombrowski hired popular former shortstop alan trammell to manage the team in *num* .
with fellow ' *num* teammates kirk gibson and lance parrish on the coaching staff , the rebuilding process began .
on august *num* , *num* , the tigers ' defeat at the hands of the chicago white sox caused them to join the *num* new york mets , who were a first year expansion team , as the only modern mlb teams to lose *num* games before september .
they avoided tying the *num* mets ' modern mlb record of *num* losses only by winning five of their last six games of the season , including three out of four against the minnesota twins , who had already clinched the al central and were resting their stars .
mike maroth went 9–21 for the *num* tigers and became the first pitcher to lose *num* games in more than *num* years .
maroth , jeremy bonderman ( 6–19 ) , and nate cornejo ( 6–17 ) led the majors in losses , the first time in history that this had occurred .
the tigers finished 43–119 , the worst record in franchise history .
this eclipsed the previous al record of *num* losses set by the *num* philadelphia athletics .
while the *num* tigers rank as the third worst team in major league history based on total losses , they fare slightly better based on winning percentage .
their .
*num* win percentage is the majors ' sixth-worst since *num* .
after the embarrassing *num* season , the tigers vowed to make changes .
under dave dombrowski , the franchise demonstrated a willingness to sign marquee free agents .
in *num* , the team signed or traded for several talented but high-risk veterans , such as fernando viña , rondell white , iván rodríguez , ugueth urbina , and carlos guillén , and the gamble paid off .
the *num* tigers finished 72–90 , a 29-game improvement over the previous season .
this was the largest improvement in the al since the baltimore orioles had a 33-game improvement from *num* to *num* .
prior to the *num* season , the tigers spent a large sum for two prized free agents , troy percival and magglio ordóñez .
on june *num* , *num* , the tigers traded pitcher ugueth urbina and infielder ramón martínez to the philadelphia phillies for plácido polanco .
the tigers stayed on the fringes of contention for the al wild card for the first four months of the season , but then faded badly , finishing 71–91 .
the collapse was perceived as being due both to injuries and to a lack of player unity ; rodríguez in particular was disgruntled , taking a leave of absence during the season to deal with a difficult divorce .
trammell , though popular with the fans , took part of the blame for the poor clubhouse atmosphere and lack of continued improvement , and he was fired at the end of the season .
a highlight of the *num* campaign was detroit's hosting of the major league baseball all-star game , its first since *num* .
in the home run derby , rodríguez finished second , losing to the phillies ' bobby abreu .
in october *num* , jim leyland , who managed dombrowski's *num* world series champion florida marlins , replaced trammell as manager ; two months later , in response to troy percival's arm problems , closer todd jones , who had spent five seasons in detroit ( 1997–2001 ) , signed a two-year deal to return to the tigers .
veteran left-hander kenny rogers also joined the tigers from the texas rangers in late *num* .
after years of futility , the *num* season showed signs of hope .
the impressive rookie campaigns of eventual al rookie of the year justin verlander , centerfielder curtis granderson , and flamethrowing relief pitcher joel zumaya , coupled with a well-publicized early-season tirade by leyland , helped the team explode and quickly rise to the top of the al central .
the team reached a high point when they were *num* games over .
*num* , but a second half swoon started to raise questions about the team's staying power .
on august *num* , a 7–1 victory over the cleveland indians gave the tigers their *ord* victory and their first winning season since *num* .
on september *num* , the tigers beat the kansas city royals 11–4 to clinch their first playoff berth since *num* .
a division title seemed inevitable .
all that was required was one win in the final five games of the season , which included three games against the royals , whom the tigers had manhandled much of the season .
however , the tigers lost all five games to finish 95–67 , and the division title went to the 96–66 minnesota twins .
the tigers instead settled for the al wild card .
the playoffs saw the tigers beat the heavily favored new york yankees 3–1 in the alds and sweep the oakland athletics in the *num* alcs , thanks to a walk-off home run in game *num* by right fielder magglio ordóñez .
they advanced to the world series , where they lost to the underdog st .
louis cardinals in five games .
during the offseason , the tigers traded for outfielder gary sheffield , who had been a part of the *num* world series champion florida marlins managed by jim leyland .
in addition to acquisitions , dombrowski developed a productive farm system .
justin verlander and joel zumaya , the most notable rookie contributors to the *num* team , were followed by andrew miller , who was drafted in *num* and called up early in the *num* campaign , and minor leaguer cameron maybin , an athletic five-tool outfielder ranked #6 in baseball america's *num* top *num* prospects .
on june *num* , verlander threw the tigers ' first no-hitter since *num* ( jack morris ) and the first in comerica park history , in a 4–0 win over the milwaukee brewers .
the tigers had the best record in baseball in late july , but lost a few players to injuries and started to play poorly in the second half .
the tigers were officially eliminated from playoff competition on september *num* , *num* when the new york yankees clinched a wild card berth .
the tigers , at 88–74 , finished second in the al central .
magglio ordóñez captured the al batting title in *num* with a .
*num* average , becoming the first tiger to win it since norm cash did so in *num* .
going into the *num* season , the franchise traded for prominent talent in édgar rentería ( from the atlanta braves ) and miguel cabrera and dontrelle willis ( from the florida marlins ) .
however , the tigers , who now boasted the second-highest team payroll in the majors at over $138 million , began the regular season by losing seven straight games .
the tigers climbed back , and at the midway point of the season , they were 42–40 .
in the end , the team finished miserably , slumping to a 74–88 record .
justin verlander finished with his worst season as a pro , as he went 11–17 with a *num* .
*num* era .
the tigers also lost closer todd jones to retirement on september *num* , *num* .
despite the disappointing season , the team set an attendance record in *num* , drawing *num* , *num* , *num* customers to comerica park .
going into the *num* season , the tigers acquired starter edwin jackson from the *num* al champion tampa bay rays , and called up rookie and former #1 draft pick rick porcello .
jackson was outstanding in the first half , making his first all-star team , while porcello was solid most of the year , posting a 14–9 record with a *num* .
*num* era and displaying grit and maturity beyond his *num* years of age .
justin verlander bounced back from an off *num* to win *num* games .
he posted a *num* .
*num* era and led the al in strikeouts ( *num* ) to finish third in the al cy young balloting .
fernando rodney assumed the closer role in spring training , replacing the retired todd jones .
rodney responded with *num* saves in *num* tries , while bobby seay , fu-te ni , brandon lyon , and ryan perry shored up the middle relief that plagued the team in 2007–08 .
despite the improvements , the tigers once again found themselves struggling to hold a lead in the al central .
the team entered september with a 7-game lead in the division , but wound up tied with the minnesota twins at *num* wins by the final day of the regular season .
the season ended on october *num* with a 6–5 loss in *num* innings to the twins in the tie-breaker game , leaving the tigers with an 86–77 record .
the tigers spent *num* days of the *num* season in first place , but became the first team in major league history to lose a three-game lead with four games left to play .
entering *num* , the tigers parted ways with curtis granderson and edwin jackson as part of a three-way trade with the new york yankees and arizona diamondbacks ; in return they picked up outfield prospect austin jackson and pitchers phil coke , max scherzer and daniel schlereth .
jackson made the tigers opening day roster , and was american league rookie of the month for april .
*num* also saw the debut of brennan boesch , who was named the al rookie of the month for may and june .
at the all-star break , the tigers were a half-game out of first place in the al central , behind the chicago white sox .
however , a slow start after the break and injuries to three key players sent the tigers into yet another second half tailspin .
the tigers finished the season in third place with an 81–81 record , *num* games back of the division-winning minnesota twins .
while playing outstanding baseball at home , the tigers were just 29–52 on the road .
among the season highlights were miguel cabrera hitting .
*num* with *num* home runs and an al-best *num* rbi , earning the al silver slugger award at first base and finishing second in the al mvp race ( earning *num* of *num* first-place votes ) .
jackson ( .
*num* average , *num* runs , *num* hits , *num* stolen bases ) finished second in the al rookie of the year voting .
justin verlander enjoyed another strong season ( 18–9 record , *num* .
*num* era , *num* strikeouts ) .
on june *num* , *num* , armando galarraga was pitching a perfect game against the cleveland indians with *num* outs in the top of the ninth inning when first base umpire jim joyce made a controversial call , ruling jason donald safe at first .
video replay showed he was out .
a tearful joyce later said , " i just cost that kid a perfect game .
i thought he beat the throw .
i was convinced he beat the throw , until i saw the replay .
" galarraga would later tell reporters that joyce apologized to him directly and gave him a hug .
the next day , with joyce umpiring home plate , galarraga brought out the lineup card and the two shook hands .
despite large fan support for overturning the call , commissioner bud selig let the call stand , but said he would look into expanding instant replay in the future .
the tigers returned much of their roster from *num* , while adding relief pitcher joaquín benoit , catcher / dh victor martinez , and starting pitcher brad penny .
on may *num* , verlander took a perfect game against the toronto blue jays into the *ord* inning .
after a walk to j .
p .
arencibia , verlander coaxed a double play grounder and went on to the *ord* inning to complete his second career no-hitter by facing the minimum *num* batters .
it was the seventh no-hitter in tigers history .
on august *num* , verlander defeated the minnesota twins , 6–4 , to become the first tiger since bill gullickson in *num* to win *num* games in a season .
verlander also became the first major league pitcher since curt schilling in *num* to reach *num* wins before the end of august .
in may , the tigers were as many as eight games back of the first place cleveland indians .
however , they would start to play better .
the tigers sent five players to the *num* all-star game .
catcher alex avila was voted in as a starter , while justin verlander , josé valverde and miguel cabrera were added as reserves .
verlander was unavailable to play in the all-star game due to the rule where starting pitchers who play the sunday beforehand are ineligible .
shortstop jhonny peralta was later added to the all-star team when the yankees ' derek jeter was unable to play due to injury .
as a three-way battle for the division title developed between the tigers , indians , and chicago white sox , the tigers put together an 18–10 record in august to begin to pull away .
starter doug fister , who was acquired at the trade deadline , provided an immediate spark , going 8–1 over the final two months of the season with a sparkling *num* .
*num* era .
after a loss on september *num* , the tigers reeled off a 12-game winning streak to put any thoughts of another late-season collapse to rest .
the streak consisted of four consecutive three-game sweeps over their al central division rivals .
it was the tigers ' longest winning streak since the *num* team won *num* straight .
on september *num* , the tigers clinched the al central division title with a 3–1 win over the oakland athletics .

in the book " a place for summer : a narrative history of tiger stadium " , richard bak states that the name originated from the detroit light guard military unit , who were known as " the tigers " .
they had played significant roles in certain civil war battles and in the *num* spanish–american war .

the tigers ' rivalries with other baseball franchises have changed throughout the years , with no one rivalry standing out .
the most notable of them are with regional neighbors cleveland indians and chicago white sox .
the others are with nearby teams such as the kansas city royals , minnesota twins , and the toronto blue jays , the latter a holdover from when the tigers competed in the al east .
there are numerous tigers fans throughout the state of michigan , northwestern ohio , southwestern ontario , as well as a small fan base in and around the erie , pennsylvania area , due in part to detroit's proximity to these regions as well as the presence of the tigers ' double-a affiliate erie seawolves in northwestern pennsylvania .
the tigers have their triple-a affiliate toledo mud hens in toledo , ohio in addition to their double-a affiliate in erie .
the cities of windsor and sarnia , ontario , have large fan bases of loyal tigers fans .

" the rivalry with the indians came to a head when the tigers played the indians at progressive field in cleveland on august *num* , *num* , with the teams first and second in the al central standings .
many tigers fans who made the short trip to cleveland started several " let's go tigers ! " chants while the game was tied in the *ord* inning .
irritated that their rivals were " taking over " their home stadium , many indians fans decided to combat the chant with a " detroit's bankrupt ! " chant , in reference to the city's *num* bankruptcy .
footage of the game from sportstime ohio that had the chants clearly audible quickly went viral , with many baseball fans on social media criticizing the indians fans for the chant due to the circumstances of detroit's financial situation .

the tigers used to have different versions of the old english d on the cap and jersey .
in *num* , the tigers changed the classic curved logo on their home uniforms to match that of the sharp-cornered hat logo ; additionally , the logo on the cap was enlarged .
in *num* , the tigers reverted back to a smaller logo on the cap .
unique characteristics of the tigers uniforms : alternate jerseys : in *num* , the tigers introduced a solid navy blue alternate jersey , which featured the team's primary logo at the time , a tiger stepping through the d , on the chest .

its origins can be traced back to michigan lake in the 1960s where a game called cosom hockey was developed , although the present type of floorball was invented in sweden in the 1970s .
floorball is most popular where it has been developed the longest , such as the czech republic , denmark , estonia , finland , latvia , norway , sweden , and switzerland .

while the iff contains *num* members , norway , the czech republic , finland , sweden , and switzerland have consistently placed *ord* , *ord* , or *ord* at the world floorball championships .
the sport is relatively new and therefore evolving .
the basic rules were established in *num* when the first floorball club in the world , sala ibk from sala , was founded in sweden .
official rules for matches were first written down in *num* .
in various forms the game has been played since the early *ord* century in canada as a recreational sport , especially in high school gymnasiums , as a playful variant of hockey , where the sticks got their form from the hockey game bandy .
most canadian males born in the 1950s and before could attest to this .
similarly , during the 1950s and 1960s many public school systems within michigan incorporated floorball into their primary and secondary school gym classes .
later , americans claimed to have invented it , and held interstate tournaments in the 1960s .
the game was formally organized as an international and more organised sport in the late 1970s in gothenburg , sweden .
the sport began as something that was played for fun as a pastime in schools .
after a decade or so , floorball began showing up in nordic countries where the former schoolyard pastime was becoming a developed sport .
formal rules soon were developed , and clubs began to form .
after some time , several countries developed national associations , and the iff was founded in *num* .
the game of floorball is also known by many other names , such as salibandy ( in finland ) , innebandy ( in sweden and norway ) , and unihockey ( in switzerland and ireland ) .
the names " salibandy " and " innebandy " are derived from bandy ; they translate to " hall bandy " and " indoor bandy " respectively .
unihockey is derived from " universal hockey " since it is meant to be a special and simplified hockey form .
when the iff was founded in *num* , the sport was played in mostly nordic countries , japan , and several parts of europe .
by *num* , floorball was recognized in *num* countries , and by the time of the first european floorball championships in *num* , that number had risen to *num* .

as of *num* , the sport of floorball has been played in almost *num* countries .
of those , *num* have national floorball associations that are recognized by the iff .
with the addition of sierra leone , africa's first floorball nation , the iff has at least one national association on each continent of the world , with the exception of antarctica .
*num* years after the iff was founded , the first world championships were played , with a sold out final of *num* , *num* people at the globen in stockholm , sweden .
in addition to that , the world's two largest floorball leagues , finland's salibandyliiga and sweden's svenska superligan were formed , in *num* and *num* respectively .
in december *num* , the iff and the sport of floorball received recognition from the international olympic committee ( ioc ) .
in july *num* , the ioc officially welcomed the iff into its family of recognised international sports federations ( arisf ) .
this will pave the way for floorball to enter the official sport programme .
the iff hopes that this recognition will help allow floorball to become a part of the *num* summer olympics .
in january *num* , the iff and the sport of floorball received recognition from the special olympics .
in addition to recognition by the international olympic committee and special olympics , the iff is also a member of the sport accord – formerly known as general association of international sports federations ( gaisf ) , and co-operates with the international university sports federation ( fisu ) .
floorball is now also member of iwga which runs the world games and floorball will be for the first time on programme in wrocław *num* .
the world floorball championships are an annual event where teams from across the world gather to play in a tournament in order to win the world championship .
as of *num* , eight men's , eight women's , six men's under-19 , and four women's under-19 world floorball championships have taken place .
the czech republic , finland , norway , sweden , and switzerland remain the only five countries to have ever captured a medal at a world championship event .
from *num* to *num* , the iff used a world floorball championship format where the last team in the a-division was relegated to the b-division , while the top team in the b-division was promoted to the a-division .
this format caused much hardship for countries such as australia , canada , slovakia , and spain , who have all been trying to get to the b-division from the c-division since *num* .
in *num* , the iff adopted a fifa-like continental qualification system , where teams must qualify to play at the world championships .
depending on the number of countries registered per continent or region , the iff gives spots for the world championships .
for example , argentina , brazil , canada and the united states would need to play for one spot at the world championships in a continental qualification tournament for the americas .
floorball is played indoors on a rink whose size can officially vary from wide to long , and which is surrounded by high enclosed boards with rounded corners .
the goals are wide and high .
their depth is and they are from the end of the nearest boards .
face-off dots are marked on the center line .
dots are also marked from both sides of the rink on the goal lines imaginary extensions .
the dots don't exceed in diameter .
they do not have to be dots , they can be also be crosses .
typical equipment for a floorball player consists of a stick , a pair of shorts , a shirt , socks , and indoor sport shoes .
players may wear shin guards , eye protectors and protective padding for vital areas although most do not .
protective eyewear is , in some countries , compulsory for junior players .
a floorball stick is short compared with one for ice hockey ; the maximum size for a stick is *num* cm .
as a stick cannot weigh any more than *num* grams , floorball sticks are often made of carbon and composite materials .
the blade of the stick can either be " right " or " left " which indicates which way stick is supposed to be held from the players point of view .
a player who is right-handed will often use a " left " blade since this he / she will be holding the stick to left and the other way around for left-handed people .
goalkeepers wear limited protection provided by padded pants , a padded chest protector , knee pads , and a helmet .
the goalkeeper may also wear other protective equipment such as elbow pads and jock straps but bulky padding is not permitted .
goalkeepers do not use sticks and may use their hands to play the ball when they are within the goalkeeper's box .
there , they are allowed to throw the ball out to their teammates provided that the ball touches the ground before the half court mark .
when they are completely outside the box , goalkeepers are considered field players and are not allowed to touch the ball with their hands .
a floor ball weighs and its diameter is .
it has *num* holes in it , each of which are in diameter .
many of these balls now are made with aerodynamic technology , where the ball has over a thousand small dimples in it that reduce air resistance .
there have been several times where a ball has been recorded to have traveled at a speed of approximately .
each team can field six players at a time on the court , one player being a goalkeeper .
but the coach can take the goalkeeper off for a short amount of time , and switch him with a field player .
this can make advantages for the attacking side of the team , and disadvantages when it comes to their own defense .
the team is also allowed to change players any time in the game ; usually , they change the whole team .
individual substitution happens sometimes , but it usually happens when a player is exhausted or is hurt .
a floorball game is officially played over three periods lasting *num* minutes each ( *num* minutes for juniors ) .
the time is stopped in the case of penalties , goals , time-outs and any situation where the ball is not considered to be in play .
the signal of a timeout should be a triple sound .
an intermission of *num* minutes ( or maximum *num* minutes in some competitions ) takes place between each period , where teams change ends and substitution areas .
each team is allowed one timeout of *num* seconds ( which is often used late in matches ) .
there are two referees to oversee the game , each with equal authority .
if a game ends in a tie , teams play ten minutes extra , and the team that scores first wins .
.
if the game is still drawn after extra-time , a penalty shootout similar to ice-hockey decides over the winner .
checking is prohibited in floorball .
controlled shoulder-to-shoulder contact is allowed , but ice hockey-like checking is forbidden .
pushing players without the ball or competing for a loose ball is also disallowed , and many of these infractions lead to two-minute penalties .
the best comparison in terms of legal physical contact is association football ( soccer ) , where checking is used to improve one's positioning in relation to the ball rather than to remove an opposing player from the play .
in addition to checking , players cannot lift an opponent’s stick or perform any stick infractions in order to get to the ball .
as well , players may not raise their stick or play the ball above their knee level , and a stick may not be placed between a player's legs .
passing the ball by foot is allowed , but only once , after that it the ball has to be touched by the stick .
after stopping the ball by foot the ball has to be touched with the stick before it can be passed to a fellow player by foot ( rule change *num* ) .
passing by hand or head deliberately may result in a two minutes penalty for the offending player .
a field player may not enter the marked goal area and playing without stick is prohibited .
when a player commits a foul , or when the ball is deemed unplayable , the play is resumed from a free-hit or a face-off .
a free hit involves a player from one team to start play from the place where the ball was last deemed unplayable .
a comparison of this is a free kick in soccer .
for many fouls , such as stick infractions , a free hit is the only discipline provided .
however , at the referee's discretion , a penalty may be worth either two or five minutes .
at that point , the player who committed the foul sits in the penalty area , and his team is shorthanded for the time of the penalty .
if an ' extreme ' foul is committed , such as physical contact or unsportsmanlike behavior , a player may receive a 10-minute penalty or even a match misconduct .
two-minute penalties can arise from a number of infractions and result in the offending player being sat on a penalty seat next to the scorers / timekeepers and away from the team benches .
each penalty has a specific code that is recorded on the official match record along with the time of the foul .
the team of the offending player will play short-handed for the full length of the penalty .
the codes are as follows ; two minute penalties *num* minute penalties personal fouls / penalties freebandy is a sport that developed in the 2000s from floorball fanatics who specialize in a technique called " zorro " , which involves lifting the ball onto a stick and allowing air resistance and fast movements to keep the ball " stuck " to the stick .
this technique is also referred to as " airhooking " or " skyhooking " .
in freebandy , the rules are very much the same of those of floorball , with the exception of high nets and no infractions for high sticking .
as well , the sticks are slightly tweaked from those of a floorball variety to include a " pocket " where the ball can be placed .
floorball at the special olympics is slightly modified from the " regular " form of floorball .
matches are played 3-on-3 with a goaltender , on a smaller court that measures long by wide .
this form of floorball was developed for the intellectually disabled , and has yet to be played at the special olympics .
floorball was played as a demonstration sport at the *num* special olympics world winter games , and was played as an official sport at the games in *num* .
a simplified less formal version of floorball , played with smaller team numbers and shorter periods , and typically outdoors on various surfaces , including astroturf .
in its most basic form , it is an informal pick up game amongst friends .
however , a more formal version is played in sweden , with the following structure : swiss floorball called unihockey is a revised version of a floorball match .
the match is played on a slightly smaller court and often involves only three field players playing on each side , in 3-on-3 floorball .
this form of floorball is also slightly shorter , with only two periods of *num* to *num* minutes each played .
in switzerland this form of playing is called " smallcourt " ( kleinfeld ) , opposed to the usual style of playing on a bigger court , which is called " bigcourt " ( grossfeld ) .
originally developed for players with disabilities , wheelchair floorball is played with exactly the same rules as " regular " floorball .
players use the same stick and ball , and goaltenders are also allowed to play .
the first ever iff-sanctioned wheelchair floorball matches were played between the men's teams of the czech republic and sweden , during the *num* men's world floorball championships in prague , czech republic .
in addition to this , there is also an electric wheelchair variation .
in addition to the floorball world championships , there are other iff events for club teams such as the champions cup which is for the national competition winners from the top-4 ranked nations , and the eurofloorball cup for the national competition winners from the *ord* and lower ranked nations .
there are also many international floorball club competitions .
the asia pacific floorball championships are played every single year in new zealand , australia , singapore , or japan .
the event was created by the singapore floorball association together with the cooperation of the asia oceania floorball confederation ( aofc ) .
members of the aofc get together during this tournament to play for the asia pacific floorball championship every year .
the most recent champions are men's national floorball team of australia .
as of *num* , the asia pacific floorball championship is also the qualifying tournament for the world floorball championships .
the canada cup is an international club tournament that is held every year in toronto , ontario , canada .
it is the largest floorball club tournament outside of europe , and attracts 55+ clubs from worldwide , every year .
the winners of the *num* canada cup floorball tournament were the ottawa blizzard floorball club .
the usa cup is an international club tournament that is held annually in dallas–fort worth metroplex , united states .
it is a part of nafc series with canada cup and falls floorball classic .
the nafc - north american floorball championship is an international club tournament series currently including three tournaments : canada cup , falls floorball classic and usa cup .
teams must attend at least one tournament in canada and one in the united states with a roster that is made up of at least *num* % of the same players and using the same club name to be eligible .
the world's largest club team tournament , the czech open is a traditional summer tournament held in prague , czech republic .
it is famous not only for its on-court activities , but also for those off-court .
the tournament attracts 200+ clubs every year from *num* different countries .
the most recent champions of the prestigious czech open are sweden's ibf falun .
the champions cup was played for the first time in *num* .
it is now the premier iff event for men's and women's club teams .
the national championship winners from the top-4 ranked nations receive automatic qualification , while the remaining two spots are made up by a team nominated by the local event organiser and the winner of the previous year's eurofloorball cup .
in *num* , the winners were men : ssv helsinki ( finland ) and women : if djurgårdens ibf ( sweden ) .
the eurofloorball cup ( formerly european cup ) is an iff-organised club event for both men's and women's teams .
it has taken place every single year since *num* , and in *num* it changed its format to a 2-year event ( i .
e .
2000–01 ) .
in *num* , the tournament switched back to its one-year format .
in *num* it underwent another change when the champions cup was introduced for the first time .
the eurofloorball cup ( efc ) is now for the national competition winners from the *ord* and lower ranked nations .
qualification can be made via a number of processes .
firstly , the teams from the *ord* , *ord* & *ord* ranked nations receive automatic qualification .
a team nominated by the local event organiser also gets automatic qualification , and then the last two spots are determined by qualification tournaments .
the winner of the efc qualifies to play in the champions cup the following year .
the reigning eurofloorball cup champions as of october *num* , are men : rtu / inspecta ( latvia ) and women : rsu / runway ( latvia ) .
gödel's ontological proof gödel's ontological proof is a formal argument by the mathematician kurt gödel ( 1906–1978 ) for god's existence .
more precisely , it presupposes the notion of " positive " and " negative " properties , and proves the necessary existence of an object which each positive property , but no negative property , applies to .
the argument is in a line of development that goes back to anselm of canterbury ( 1033–1109 ) .
st .
anselm's ontological argument , in its most succinct form , is as follows : " god , by definition , is that for which no greater can be conceived .
god exists in the understanding .
if god exists in the understanding , we could imagine him to be greater by existing in reality .
therefore , god must exist .
" a more elaborate version was given by gottfried leibniz ( 1646–1716 ) ; this is the version that gödel studied and attempted to clarify with his ontological argument .
gödel left a fourteen-point outline of his philosophical beliefs in his papers .
points relevant to the ontological proof include the first version of the ontological proof in gödel's papers is dated " around *num* " .
gödel is not known to have told anyone about his work on the proof until *num* , when he thought he was dying .
in february , he allowed dana scott to copy out a version of the proof , which circulated privately .
in august *num* , gödel told oskar morgenstern that he was " satisfied " with the proof , but morgenstern recorded in his diary entry for *num* august *num* , that gödel would not publish because he was afraid that others might think " that he actually believes in god , whereas he is only engaged in a logical investigation ( that is , in showing that such a proof with classical assumptions ( completeness , etc .
) correspondingly axiomatized , is possible ) .
" gödel died january *num* , *num* .
another version , slightly different from scott's , was found in his papers .
it was finally published , together with scott's version , in *num* .
morgenstern's diary is an important and usually reliable source for gödel's later years , but the implication of the august *num* diary entry—that gödel did not believe in god—is not consistent with the other evidence .
in letters to his mother , who was not a churchgoer and had raised kurt and his brother as freethinkers , gödel argued at length for a belief in an afterlife .
he did the same in an interview with a skeptical hao wang , who said : " i expressed my doubts as g spoke [ .
.
.
] gödel smiled as he replied to my questions , obviously aware that his answers were not convincing me .
" wang reports that gödel's wife , adele , two days after gödel's death , told wang that " gödel , although he did not go to church , was religious and read the bible in bed every sunday morning .
" in an unmailed answer to a questionnaire , gödel described his religion as " baptized lutheran ( but not member of any religious congregation ) .
my belief is " theistic " , not pantheistic , following leibniz rather than spinoza .
" the proof uses modal logic , which distinguishes between " necessary " truths and " contingent " truths .
in the most common semantics for modal logic , many " possible worlds " are considered .
a truth is " necessary " if it is true in all possible worlds .
by contrast , a truth is " contingent " if it just happens to be the case .
for instance , " more than half of this planet is covered by water " is a contingent truth , that relies upon which planet " this planet " is .
if a statement happens to be true in our world , but is false in another world , then it is a contingent truth .
a statement that is true in some world ( not necessarily our own ) is called a " possible " truth .
furthermore , the proof uses higher-order ( modal ) logic because the definition of god employs an explicit quantification over properties .
first , gödel axiomatizes the notion of a " positive property " : for each property " φ " , either " φ " or its negation ¬"φ " must be positive , but not both ( axiom *num* ) .
if a positive property " φ " implies a property " ψ " in each possible world , then " ψ " is positive , too ( axiom *num* ) .
gödel then argues that each positive property is " possibly exemplified " , i .
e .
applies at least to some object in some world ( theorem *num* ) .
defining an object to be godlike if it has all positive properties ( definition *num* ) , and requiring that property to be positive itself ( axiom *num* ) , gödel shows that in " some " possible world a godlike object exists ( theorem *num* ) , called " god " in the following .
gödel proceeds to prove that a godlike object exists in " every " possible world .
to this end , he defines " essences " : if " x " is an object in some world , then a property " φ " is said to be an essence of " x " if " φ " ( " x " ) is true in that world and if " φ " necessarily entails all other properties that " x " has in that world ( definition *num* ) .
requiring positive properties being positive in every possible world ( axiom *num* ) , gödel can show that godlikeness is an essence of a godlike object ( theorem *num* ) .
now , " x " is said to " exist necessarily " if , for every essence " φ " of " x " , there is an element " y " with property " φ " in every possible world ( definition *num* ) .
axiom *num* requires necessary existence to be a positive property .
hence , it must follow from godlikeness .
moreover , godlikeness is an essence of god , since it entails all positive properties , and any non-positive property is the negation of some positive property , so god cannot have any non-positive properties .
since necessary existence is also a positive property ( axiom *num* ) , it must be a property of every godlike object , as every godlike object has all the positive properties ( definition *num* ) .
since any godlike object is necessarily existent , it follows that any godlike object in one world is a godlike object in all worlds , by the definition of necessary existence .
given the existence of a godlike object in one world , proven above , we may conclude that there is a godlike object in every possible world , as required ( theorem *num* ) .
besides axiom 1-5 and definition 1-3 , a few other axioms from modal logic were tacitly used in the proof .
from these hypotheses , it is also possible to prove that there is only one god in each world by leibniz's law , the identity of indiscernibles : two or more objects are identical ( the same ) if they have all their properties in common , and so , there would only be one object in each world that possesses property g .
gödel did not attempt to do so however , as he purposely limited his proof to the issue of existence , rather than uniqueness .
formula_1 there is an ongoing open-source effort to formalize gödel's proof to a level that is suitable for automated theorem proving or at least computer verification via proof assistants .
the effort made headlines in german newspapers .
according to the authors of this effort , they were inspired by melvin fitting's book .
most criticism of gödel's proof is aimed at its axioms : as with any proof in any logical system , if the axioms the proof depends on are doubted , then the conclusions can be doubted .
this is particularly applicable to gödel's proof – because it rests on five axioms , some of which are questionable .
a proof does not necessitate that the conclusion be correct , but rather that by accepting the axioms , the conclusion follows logically .
many philosophers have called the axioms into question .
the first layer of criticism is simply that there are no arguments presented that give reasons why the axioms are true .
a second layer is that these particular axioms lead to unwelcome conclusions .
this line of thought was argued by jordan howard sobel , showing that if the axioms are accepted , they lead to a " modal collapse " where every statement that is true is necessarily true , i .
e .
the sets of necessary , of contingent , and of possible truths all coincide ( provided there are accessible worlds at all ) .
according to koons , sobel suggested that gödel might have welcomed modal collapse .
there are suggested amendments to the proof , presented by c .
anthony anderson , but argued to be refutable by anderson and michael gettings .
sobel's proof of modal collapse has been questioned by robert koons , but a counter-defence by sobel has been given .
in *num* , christoph benzmüller and bruno woltzenlogel-paleo gave a computer-checked proof of modal collapse .
in the same paper , they suspected gödel's original version of the axioms to be inconsistent ; in *num* , they gave a computer proof that this version implies formula_2 , i .
e .
is inconsistent in every modal logic with a reflexive or symmetric accessibility relation .
gödel's proof has also been questioned by graham oppy , asking whether lots of other almost-gods would also be " proven " by gödel's axioms .
this counter-argument has been questioned by gettings , who agrees that the axioms might be questioned , but disagrees that oppy's particular counter-example can be shown from gödel's axioms .
religious scholars such as fr .
robert j .
spitzer have accepted gödel's proof , calling it " an improvement over the anselmian ontological argument ( which does not work ) .
" there are , however , many more criticisms , most focusing on the philosophically interesting question of whether these axioms " must " be rejected to avoid odd conclusions .
the broader criticism is that even if the axioms cannot be shown to be false , that does not mean that they are true .
hilbert's famous remark about interchangeability of the primitives ' names applies to those in gödel's ontological axioms ( " "positive " , " god-like " , " essence" " ) as well as to those in hilbert's geometry axioms ( " "point " , " line " , " plane" " ) .
according to andré fuhrmann ( *num* ) it remains to show that the dazzling notion prescribed by traditions and often believed to be essentially mysterious satisfies gödel's axioms .
this is not a mathematical , but merely a theological task .
it is this task which decides which religion's god has been proven to exist .
a humorous variant of gödel's ontological proof is mentioned in quentin canterel's novel " the jolly coroner " .
the proof is also mentioned in the tv series " hand of god " .
dagger a dagger is a knife with a very sharp point and one or two sharp edges , typically designed or capable of being used as a thrusting or stabbing weapon .
daggers have been used throughout human experience for close combat confrontations , and many cultures have used adorned daggers in ritual and ceremonial contexts .
the distinctive shape and historic usage of the dagger have made it iconic and symbolic .
a dagger in the modern sense is a weapon designed for close-proximity combat or self-defense ; due to its use in historic weapon assemblages , it has associations with assassination and murders .
double-edged knives , however , play different sorts of roles in different social contexts .
in some cultures , they are neither a weapon nor a tool , but a potent symbol of manhood ; in others they are ritual objects used in body modifications such as circumcision .
a wide variety of thrusting knives have been described as daggers , including knives that feature only a single cutting edge , such as the european rondel dagger or the persian pesh-kabz , or , in some instances , no cutting edge at all , such as the stiletto of the renaissance .
however , in the last hundred years or so , in most contexts , a dagger has certain definable characteristics , including a short blade with a sharply tapered point , a central spine or fuller , and usually two cutting edges sharpened the full length of the blade , or nearly so .
most daggers also feature a full crossguard to keep the hand from riding forwards onto the sharpened blade edges .
daggers are primarily weapons , so knife legislation in many places restricts their manufacture , sale , possession , transport , or use .
the earliest daggers were made of materials such as flint , ivory or bone in neolithic times .
copper daggers appeared first in the early bronze age , in the *ord* millennium bc , and copper daggers of early minoan iii ( 2400–2000 bc ) were recovered at knossos .
in ancient egypt , daggers were usually made of copper or bronze , while royalty had gold weapons .
at least since pre-dynastic egypt , ( c .
*num* bc ) daggers were adorned as ceremonial objects with golden hilts and later even more ornate and varied construction .
one early silver dagger was recovered with midrib design .
the *num* opening of the tomb of tutankhamun revealed two daggers , one with a gold blade , and one of smelted iron .
it is held that mummies of the eleventh dynasty were buried with bronze sabres ; and there is a bronze dagger of thut-mes iii .
( eighteenth dynasty ) , circa b .
c .
*num* .
as late as mene-ptah ii .
of the nineteenth dynasty ( b .
c *num* ) , we read it in the list of his loot , after the prosopis battle , of bronze armour , swords and daggers .
iron production did not begin until *num* bc , and iron ore was not found in egypt , making the iron dagger rare , and the context suggests that the iron dagger was valued on a level equal to that of its ceremonial gold counterpart .
these facts , and the composition of the dagger had long suggested a meteoritic origin , however , evidence for its meteoritic origin was not entirely conclusive until june *num* when researchers using x-ray fluorescence spectrometry confirmed similar proportions of metals ( iron , *num* % nickel , and *num* .
*num* % cobalt ) in a meteorite discovered in the area , deposited by an ancient meteor shower .
one of the earliest objects made of smelted iron is a dagger dating to before *num* bc , found in a context that suggests it was treated as an ornamental object of great value .
found in a hattic royal tomb dated about *num* bc , at alaca höyük in northern anatolia , the dagger has a smelted iron blade and a gold handle .
the artisans and blacksmiths of iberia in what is now southern spain and southwestern france produced various iron daggers and swords of high quality from the *ord* to the *ord* century bc , in ornamentation and patterns influenced by greek , punic ( carthaginian ) , and phoenician culture .
the exceptional purity of iberian iron and the sophisticated method of forging , which included cold hammering , produced double-edged weapons of excellent quality .
one can find technologically advanced designs such as folding knives rusted among the artifacts of many second iberian iron age cremation burials or in roman empire excavations all around spain and the mediterranean .
iberian infantrymen carried several types of iron daggers , most of them based on shortened versions of double-edged swords , but the true iberian dagger had a triangular-shaped blade .
iberian daggers and swords were later adopted by hannibal and his carthaginian armies .
the lusitanii , a pre-celtic people dominating the lands west of iberia ( most of modern portugal and extremadura ) successfully held off the roman empire for many years with a variety of innovative tactics and light weapons , including iron-bladed short spears and daggers modeled after iberian patterns .
during the roman empire , legionaries were issued a " pugio " ( from the latin " pugnō " , or “fight” ) , a double-edged iron thrusting dagger with a blade of 7–12 inches .
the design and fabrication of the " pugio " was taken directly from iberian daggers and short swords ; the romans even adopted the triangular-bladed iberian dagger , which they called the " parazonium " .
like the " gladius " , the " pugio " was most often used as a thrusting ( stabbing weapon ) .
as an extreme close-quarter combat weapon , the " pugio " was the roman soldier's last line of defense .
when not in battle , the " pugio " served as a convenient utility knife .
the term " dagger " appears only in the late middle ages , reflecting the fact that while the dagger had been known in antiquity , it had disappeared during the early middle ages , replaced by the hewing knife or seax .
the dagger reappeared in the *ord* century as the " knightly dagger " , or more properly cross-hilt or quillon dagger , and was developed into a common arm and tool for civilian use by the late medieval period .
the earliest known depiction of a cross-hilt dagger is the so-called " guido relief " inside the grossmünster of zürich ( c .
*num* ) .
a number of depictions of the fully developed cross-hilt dagger are found in the morgan bible ( c .
*num* ) .
many of these cross-hilt daggers resemble miniature swords , with cross guards and pommels very similar in form to swords of the period .
others , however , are not an exact match to known sword designs , having for example pommel caps , large hollow star shaped pommels on so-called “burgundian heraldic daggers” or antenna style cross and pommel , reminiscent of hallstatt era daggers .
the cross-hilt type persisted well into the renaissance the old french term " dague " appears to have referred to these weapons in the *ord* century , alongside other terms such as " poignal " and " basilard " .
the middle english " dagger " is used from the 1380s .
during this time , the dagger was often employed in the role of a secondary defense weapon in close combat .
the knightly dagger evolved into the larger baselard knife in the *ord* century .
during the *ord* century , it became fairly common for knights to fight on foot to strengthen the infantry defensive line .
this necessitated greater dagger usage .
at agincourt ( *num* ) archers used them to dispatch dismounted knights by thrusting the narrow blades through helmet vents and other apertures .
the baselard was considered an intermediate between a short sword and a long dagger , and became popular also as a civilian weapon .
sloane ms .
*num* ( c .
*num* ) records a song satirizing the use of oversized baselard knives as fashion accessories .
in the late middle ages , knives with blade designs that emphasized thrusting attacks , such as the stiletto , became increasingly popular , and some thrusting knives commonly referred to as ' daggers ' ceased to have a cutting edge .
this was a response to the deployment of heavy armor , such as maille and plate armour , where cutting attacks were ineffective and focus was on thrusts with narrow blades to punch through mail or aim at armour plate intersections ( or the eye slits of the helmet visor ) .
these late medieval thrusting weapons are sometimes classed by the shape of their hilt as either roundel , bollock or ear daggers .
the term " dagger " is coined in this time , as are the early modern german equivalents " dolch " ( " tolch " ) and " degen " ( " tegen " ) .
in the german school of fencing , johannes liechtenauer ( ms .
3227a ) and his successors ( specifically andres lignizer in cod .
*num* a *num* ) taught fighting with the dagger .
these techniques in some respects resemble modern knife fighting , but emphasized thrusting strokes almost exclusively , instead of slashes and cuts .
when used offensively , a standard attack frequently employed the reverse or icepick grip , stabbing downward with the blade to increase thrust and penetrative force .
this was done primarily because the blade point frequently had to penetrate or push apart an opponent's steel chain mail or plate armor in order to inflict an injury .
the disadvantage of employing the medieval dagger in this manner was that it could easily be blocked by a variety of techniques , most notably by a block with the weaponless arm while simultaneously attacking with a weapon held in the right hand .
another disadvantage was the reduction in effective blade reach to the opponent when using a reverse grip .
as the wearing of armor fell out of favor , dagger fighting techniques began to evolve which emphasized the use of the dagger with a conventional or forward grip , while the reverse or icepick grip was retained when attacking an unsuspecting opponent from behind , such as in an assassination .
] the dagger was very popular as a fencing and personal defense weapon in 17th- and 18th-century spain , where it was referred to as the " daga " or " puñal " .
during the renaissance age the dagger was used as part of everyday dress , and daggers were the only weapon commoners were allowed to carry on their person .
in english , the terms " poniard " and " dirk " are loaned during the late *ord* to early *ord* century , the latter in the spelling " dork , durk " ( presumably via low german , dutch or scandinavian " dolk , dolch " , ultimately from a west slavic " tulich " ) , the modern spelling " dirk " dating to 18th-century scots .
beginning with the *ord* century , another form of dagger—the plug bayonet and later the socket bayonet—was used to convert muskets and other longarms into spears by mounting them on the barrel .
they were periodically used for eating ; the arm was also used for a variety of other tasks such as mending boots , house repairs and farm jobs .
the final function of the dagger was as an obvious and ostentatious means of enhancing a man's personal apparel , conforming to fashion which dictated that all men carried them .
ww1 trench warfare caused daggers and fighting knives to come back in play .
they also replaced the sabres worn by officers , which were too long and clumsy for trench warfare .
they were worn with pride as a sign of having served front line duty .
daggers achieved public notoriety in the *ord* century as ornamental uniform regalia during the fascist dictatorships of mussolini's italy and hitler's germany .
dress daggers were used by several other countries as well , including japan , but never to the same extent .
as combat equipment they were carried by many infantry and commando forces during the second world war .
british commando and other elite units were issued an especially slender dagger , the fairbairn-sykes fighting knife , developed by william e .
fairbairn and eric a .
sykes from real-life close-combat experiences gained while serving on the shanghai municipal police force .
the f-s dagger proved very popular with the commandos , who used it primarily for sentry elimination .
some units of the u .
s .
marine corps raiders in the pacific were issued a similar fighting dagger , the marine raider stiletto .
, though this modified design proved less than successful when used in the type of knife combat encountered in the pacific theater due to this version using inferior materials and manufacturing techniques .
during the vietnam war , the gerber mark ii , designed by us army captain bud holzman and al mar , was a popular fighting knife pattern that was privately purchased by many u .
s .
soldiers and marines who served in that war .
aside from military forces , most daggers are no longer carried openly , but concealed in clothing .
one of the more popular forms of the concealable dagger is the " boot knife " .
the boot knife is nothing more than a shortened dagger that is compact enough to be worn on the lower leg , usually by means of a sheath clipped or strapped to a boot or other footwear .
the dagger is symbolically ambiguous .
daggers are commonly used as part of the insignias of elite military units or special forces , such as the us army airborne special operations unit or the commando dagger patch for those who have completed the british all arms commando course .
daggers may be associated with deception , stealth , and / or treachery due to the ease of concealment and surprise that someone could inflict with one on an unsuspecting victim , and indeed many assassinations have been carried out with the use of a dagger , including that of julius caesar .
a cloak and dagger attack is one in which a deceitful , traitorous , or concealed enemy attacks a person .
on the other hand , for some cultures and military organizations the dagger symbolizes courage and daring in combat .
dagger reputation was tainted by its periodic use , or alleged employment , in the commission of disreputable , secretive and unsavoury deeds .
perhaps these are exaggerated ; however , it became associated with assassinations performed when the concealed weapon was suddenly flourished and used to kill .
consequently , it developed connotations with murky , cowardly assaults in dark alleys , upon shadowy staircases , and of hired murderers emerging from concealment to stab innocent , sleeping victims .
to a degree , some antipathy towards the dagger has remained unchanged up to modern times .
this is perhaps , partly due to the periodic , contemporary broadcasting of bloodthirsty films and television series depicting gangsters employing the stiletto daggers .
history is punctuated with accounts of daggers being used in assassinations and coup d'état attempts .
on march *num* , 44bc , gaius julius caesar was assassinated by a large group of conspirators who stabbed him repeatedly with their daggers .
this took place in rome in a room behind the theatre of pompey which was being used for government business whilst the senate was being rebuilt .
to some degree , the dagger regained a little social prestige during the rapier age when personal combat became less brutal .
its involvement in this formalized , regulated martial endeavor did something to restore its reputation .
when its advantages and purpose eventually declined and weapon carrying ceased , the dagger was saved from obsolescence by its retention as a field sports gadget .
in the nineteenth century the custom of wearing a general purpose knife practically ceased and the hunting knife became a specialized instrument .
however , its combat and military traditions were incorporated in the bayonet weapon which has continued in use until the present day .
daggers are a popular form of what is known as the " art knife " , due in part to the symmetry of the blade .
one of the most famous examples is knifemaker buster warenski's replication of the gold dagger found in tutankhamun's tomb .
warenski's dagger was made with a cast gold blade and the knife contained *num* ounces of pure gold in its construction .
one of the knives required of an american bladesmith society mastersmith is the construction of an " art knife " or a " european style " dagger .

dracula dracula is an *num* gothic horror novel by irish author bram stoker .
it introduced the character of count dracula , and established many conventions of subsequent vampire fantasy .
the novel tells the story of dracula's attempt to move from transylvania to england so that he may find new blood and spread the undead curse , and of the battle between dracula and a small group of men and a woman led by professor abraham van helsing .
"dracula " has been assigned to many literary genres including vampire literature , horror fiction , the gothic novel , and invasion literature .
the novel has spawned numerous theatrical , film , and television interpretations .
the story is told in an epistolary format , as a series of letters , diary entries , newspaper articles , and ships ' log entries , whose narrators are the novel's protagonists , and occasionally supplemented with newspaper clippings relating events not directly witnessed .
the events portrayed in the novel take place chronologically and largely in england and transylvania during the 1890s and all transpire within the same year between *num* may and *num* november .
a short note is located at the end of the final chapter written *num* years after the events outlined in the novel .
the tale begins with jonathan harker , a newly qualified english solicitor , visiting count dracula at his castle in the carpathian mountains on the border of transylvania , bukovina , and moldavia , to provide legal support for a real estate transaction overseen by harker's employer , mr peter hawkins of exeter .
at first enticed by dracula's gracious manners , harker soon realizes that he is dracula's prisoner .
wandering the count's castle against dracula's admonition , harker encounters three female vampires , called " the sisters " , from whom he is rescued by dracula .
harker soon realizes that dracula himself is also a vampire .
after the preparations are made , dracula leaves transylvania and abandons harker to the sisters .
harker barely escapes from the castle with his life .
dracula boards a russian ship , the " demeter " , taking along with him boxes of transylvanian soil , which he required in order to regain his strength .
not long afterward , the ship having weighed anchor at varna , runs aground on the shores of whitby in the east coast of england .
the captain's log narrates the gradual disappearance of the entire crew , until the captain alone remained , himself bound to the helm to maintain course .
an animal resembling " a large dog " is seen leaping ashore .
the ship's cargo is described as silver sand and *num* boxes of " mould " , or earth , from transylvania .
it is later learned that dracula successfully purchased multiple estates under the alias ' count de ville ' throughout london and devised to distribute the *num* boxes to each of them utilizing transportation services as well as moving them himself .
he does this to secure for himself " lairs " and the *num* boxes of earth would be used as his graves which would grant safety and rest during times of feeding and replenishing his strength .
harker's fiancée , mina murray , is staying with her friend lucy westenra , who is holidaying in whitby .
lucy receives three marriage proposals from dr .
john seward , quincey morris , and arthur holmwood ( the son of lord godalming who later obtains the title himself ) .
lucy accepts holmwood's proposal while turning down seward and morris , but all remain friends .
dracula communicates with seward's patient , renfield , an insane man who wishes to consume insects , spiders , birds , and rats to absorb their " life force " .
renfield is able to detect dracula's presence and supplies clues accordingly .
soon dracula is indirectly shown to be stalking lucy .
as time passes she begins to suffer from episodes of sleepwalking and dementia , as witnessed by mina .
when lucy begins to waste away suspiciously , seward invites his old teacher , abraham van helsing , who immediately determines the true cause of lucy's condition .
he refuses to disclose it but diagnoses her with acute blood-loss .
van helsing prescribes numerous blood transfusions to which he , seward , quincey , and arthur all contribute over time .
van helsing also prescribes garlic flowers to be placed throughout her room and weaves a necklace of withered garlic blossoms for her to wear .
however she continues to waste away – appearing to lose blood every night .
while both doctors are absent , lucy and her mother are attacked by a wolf and mrs .
westenra , who has a heart condition , dies of fright .
van helsing attempts to protect her with garlic but fate thwarts him each night , whether lucy's mother removes the garlic from her room , or lucy herself does so in her restless sleep .
the doctors have found two small puncture marks about her neck , which dr .
seward is at a loss to understand .
after lucy dies , van helsing places a golden crucifix over her mouth , ostensibly to delay or prevent lucy's vampiric conversion .
fate conspires against him again when van helsing finds the crucifix in the possession of one of the servants who stole it off lucy's corpse .
following lucy's death and burial , the newspapers report children being stalked in the night by a " bloofer lady " ( i .
e .
, " beautiful lady " ) .
van helsing , knowing lucy has become a vampire , confides in seward , lord godalming , and morris .
the suitors and van helsing track her down and , after a confrontation with her , stake her heart , behead her , and fill her mouth with garlic .
around the same time , jonathan harker arrives from budapest , where mina marries him after his escape , and he and mina join the campaign against dracula .
the vampire hunters stay at dr .
seward's residence , holding nightly meetings and providing reports based on each of their various tasks .
mina discovers that each of their journals and letters collectively contain clues to which they can track him down .
she tasks herself with collecting them , researching newspaper clippings , fitting the most relevant entries into chronological order and typing out copies to distribute to each of the party which they are to study .
jonathan harker tracks down the shipments of boxed graves and the estates which dracula has purchased in order to store them .
van helsing conducts research along with dr .
seward to analyze the behaviour of their patient renfield who they learn is directly influenced by dracula .
they also research historical events , folklore , and superstitions from various cultures to understand dracula's powers and weaknesses .
van helsing also establishes a criminal profile on dracula in order to better understand his actions and predict his movements .
arthur holmwood's fortune assists in funding the entire operation and expenses .
as they discover the various properties dracula had purchased , the male protagonists team up to raid each property and are several times confronted by dracula .
as they discover each of the boxed graves scattered throughout london , they pry them open to place and seal wafers of sacramental bread within .
this act renders the boxes of earth completely useless to dracula as he is unable to open , enter or further transport them .
after dracula learns of the group's plot against him , he attacks mina on three occasions , and feeds mina his own blood to control her .
this curses mina with vampirism and changes her but does not completely turn her into a vampire .
van helsing attempts to bless mina through prayer and by placing a wafer of sacrament against her forehead , but it burns her upon contact leaving a wretched scar .
under this curse , mina oscillates from consciousness to a semi-trance during which she perceives dracula's surroundings and actions .
van helsing is able to use hypnotism twice a day , at dawn and at sunset , to put her into this trance to further track dracula's movements .
mina , afraid of dracula's link with her , urges the team not to tell her their plans out of fear that dracula will be listening .
after the protagonists discover and sterilize *num* boxes found throughout his lairs in london , they learn that dracula has fled with the missing *ord* box back to his castle in transylvania .
they pursue him under the guidance of mina .
they split up into teams once they reach europe ; van helsing and mina team up to locate the castle of dracula while the others attempt to ambush the boat dracula is using to reach his home .
van helsing raids the castle and destroys the vampire " sisters " .
upon discovering dracula being transported by gypsies , the three teams converge and attack the caravan carrying dracula in the *ord* box of earth .
after dispatching many gypsies who were sworn to protect the count , harker shears dracula through the throat with a kukri knife , while the mortally wounded quincey stabs the count in the heart with a bowie knife .
dracula crumbles to dust , and mina is freed from her curse of vampirism , as the scar on her forehead disappears .
soon after , quincey dies from his wounds .
the book closes with a note left by jonathan harker seven years after the events of the novel , detailing his married life with mina and the birth of their son , whom they name after all four members of the party , but address as " quincey " .
quincey is depicted sitting on the knee of van helsing as they recount their adventure .
seward and arthur have each gotten married .
a small section was removed from a draft of the final chapter , in which dracula's castle falls apart as he dies , hiding the fact that vampires were ever there .
between *num* and *num* , stoker was a business manager for the lyceum theatre in london , where he supplemented his income by writing a large number of sensational novels , his most successful being the vampire tale " dracula " published on *num* may *num* .
parts of it are set around the town of whitby , where he spent summer holidays .
throughout the 1880s and 1890s , authors such as h .
rider haggard , rudyard kipling , robert louis stevenson , arthur conan doyle , and h .
g .
wells wrote many tales in which fantastic creatures threatened the british empire .
invasion literature was at a peak , and stoker's formula was very familiar by *num* to readers of fantastic adventure stories , of an invasion of england by continental european influences .
victorian readers enjoyed " dracula " as a good adventure story like many others , but it did not reach its legendary status until later in the *ord* century when film versions began to appear .
before writing " dracula " , stoker spent seven years researching european folklore and stories of vampires , being most influenced by emily gerard's *num* essay " transylvania superstitions " which includes content about a vampire myth .
some historians are convinced that a historic figure , vlad iii dracula , often called vlad the impaler , was the model for stoker's count although there is no supporting evidence .
stoker borrowed only " scraps of miscellaneous information " , according to one expert , about this bloodthirsty tyrant of wallachia and there are no comments about him in stoker's working notes .
dracula scholar elizabeth miller has remarked that aside from the name and some mention of romanian history , the background of stoker's count bears no resemblance to that of vlad iii dracula .
later he also claimed that he had a nightmare , caused by eating too much crab meat , about a " vampire king " rising from his grave .
although it is a widely known vampire novel , " dracula " was not the first .
johann wolfgang von goethe published " the bride of corinth " in *num* .
( " from my grave to wander i am forc’d still to seek the god’s long-sever’d link , still to love the bridegroom i have lost , and the life-blood of his heart to drink ; ) later sheridan le fanu's *num* " carmilla " , about a lesbian vampire could have inspired bram stoker's dracula , or " varney the vampire " , a lengthy penny dreadful serial from the mid-victorian period by james malcolm rymer .
john polidori created the image of a vampire portrayed as an aristocratic man , like the character of dracula , in his tale " the vampyre " ( *num* ) .
( he wrote " vampyre " during a summer which he spent with " frankenstein " creator mary shelley , her husband poet percy bysshe shelley , and lord byron in *num* .
) the lyceum theatre where stoker worked between *num* and *num* was headed by actor-manager henry irving , who was stoker's real-life inspiration for dracula's mannerisms and who stoker hoped would play dracula in a stage version .
irving never did agree to do a stage version , but dracula's dramatic sweeping gestures and gentlemanly mannerisms drew their living embodiment from irving .
"the dead un-dead " was one of stoker's original titles for " dracula " , and the manuscript was entitled simply " the un-dead " up until a few weeks before publication .
stoker's notes for " dracula " show that the name of the count was originally " count wampyr " , but stoker became intrigued by the name " dracula " while doing research , after reading william wilkinson's book " an account of the principalities of wallachia and moldavia with political observations relative to them " ( london *num* ) , which he found in the whitby library and consulted a number of times during visits to whitby in the 1890s .
the name dracula was the patronym ( " drăculea " ) of the descendants of vlad ii of wallachia , who took the name " dracul " after being invested in the order of the dragon in *num* .
in the old romanian language , the word " dracul " ( romanian " drac " " dragon " + " -ul " " the " ) meant " the dragon " and dracula meant " son of the dragon " .
in the present day however , dracul means " the devil " .
"dracula " was published in london in may *num* by archibald constable and company .
costing six shillings , the novel was bound yellow cloth and titled in red letters .
it was copyrighted in the united states in *num* with the publication by doubleday & mcclure of new york .
but when universal studios purchased the rights , it came to light that bram stoker had not complied with a portion of us copyright law , placing the novel into the public domain .
in the united kingdom and other countries following the berne convention on copyrights , the novel was under copyright until april *num* , fifty years after stoker's death .
"dracula " was not an immediate bestseller when it was first published , although reviewers were unstinting in their praise .
the contemporary " daily mail " ranked stoker's powers above those of mary shelley and edgar allan poe , as well as emily brontë's " wuthering heights " .
according to literary historians nina auerbach and david j .
skal in the norton critical edition , the novel has become more significant for modern readers than it was for victorian readers , most of whom enjoyed it just as a good adventure story .
it reached its broad and iconic status only later in the *ord* century when the movie versions appeared .
a .
asbjørn jøn has also noted that " dracula " has had a significant impact on the image of the vampire in popular culture , folklore , and legend .
it did not make much money for stoker .
in the last year of his life , he was so poor that he had to petition for a compassionate grant from the royal literary fund , and his widow was forced to sell his notes and outlines of the novel at a sotheby's auction in *num* , where they were purchased for a little over £2 .
but then f .
w .
murnau's unauthorized adaptation of the story was released in theatres in *num* in the form of " nosferatu " .
stoker's widow took affront and , during the legal battle that followed , the novel's popularity started to grow .
"nosferatu " was followed by a highly successful stage adaptation , touring the uk for three years before arriving in the us where stoker's creation caught hollywood's attention and , after the american *num* movie version was released , the book has never been out of print .
however , some victorian fans were ahead of the time , describing it as " the sensation of the season " and " the most blood-curdling novel of the paralysed century " .
sherlock holmes author sir arthur conan doyle wrote to stoker in a letter , " i write to tell you how very much i have enjoyed reading " dracula " .
i think it is the very best story of diablerie which i have read for many years .
" the " daily mail " review of *num* june *num* proclaimed it a classic of gothic horror , " in seeking a parallel to this weird , powerful , and horrorful story our mind reverts to such tales as " the mysteries of udolpho " , " frankenstein " , " the fall of the house of usher " .
.
.
but dracula is even more appalling in its gloomy fascination than any one of these .
" similarly good reviews appeared when the book was published in the u .
s .
in *num* .
the first american edition was published by doubleday & mcclure in new york .
in the last several decades , literary and cultural scholars have offered diverse analyses of stoker's novel and the character of count dracula .
c .
f .
bentley reads dracula as an embodiment of the freudian id .
carol a .
senf reads the novel as a response to the powerful new woman , while christopher craft sees dracula as embodying latent homosexuality and sees the text as an example of a ' characteristic , if hyperbolic instance of victorian anxiety over the potential fluidity of gender roles ' .
stephen d .
arata interprets the events of the novel as anxiety over colonialism and racial mixing , and talia schaffer construes the novel as an indictment of oscar wilde .
franco moretti reads dracula as a figure of monopoly capitalism , though hollis robbins suggests that dracula's inability to participate in social conventions and to forge business partnerships undermines his power .
richard noll reads " dracula " within the context of *ord* century alienism ( psychiatry ) and asylum medicine .
d .
bruno starrs understands the novel to be a pro-catholic pamphlet promoting proselytization .
"dracula " is a work of fiction , but it does contain some historical references ; although it is a matter of conjecture and debate as to how much historical connection was deliberate on stoker's part .
attention was drawn to the supposed connections between the historical transylvanian-born vlad iii dracula ( also known as vlad tepes ) of wallachia and bram stoker's fictional dracula , following the publication of " in search of dracula " by radu florescu and raymond mcnally in *num* .
during his main reign ( 1456–1462 ) , " vlad the impaler " is said to have killed from *num* , *num* to *num* , *num* european civilians ( political rivals , criminals , and anyone that he considered " useless to humanity " ) , mainly by impaling .
the sources depicting these events are records by saxon settlers in neighbouring transylvania who had frequent clashes with vlad iii .
vlad iii is revered as a folk hero by romanians for driving off the invading ottoman turks , of whom his impaled victims are said to have included as many as *num* , *num* .
there is no solid evidence that the count in the novel was modelled on vlad the impaler of wallachia .
at most , stoker borrowed only the name dracula and " scraps of miscellaneous information " about romanian history , according to one expert , elizabeth miller ; as well , and there are no comments about him in the author's working notes .
historically , the name " dracula " is derived from a chivalric order called the order of the dragon , founded by sigismund of luxembourg ( then king of hungary ) to uphold christianity and defend the empire against the ottoman turks .
vlad ii dracul , father of vlad iii , was admitted to the order around *num* , after which vlad ii wore the emblem of the order and later , as ruler of wallachia , his coinage bore the dragon symbol , from which the name " dracula " is derived since " dracul " in romanian means " the dragon " .
people of wallachia only knew " voievod " ( prince ) vlad iii as vlad țepeș ( the impaler ) .
the name " dracula " became popular in romania after publication of stoker's book .
contrary to popular belief , the name dracula does not translate to " son of the devil " in romanian , which would be " fiul diavolului " .
stoker came across the name dracula in his reading on romanian history , and chose this to replace the name ( " count wampyr " ) originally intended for his villain .
some dracula scholars led by elizabeth miller argue that stoker knew little of the historic vlad iii except for the name " dracula " in addition to a few bits of romanian history .
stoker mentions that his dracula fought against the turks and was later betrayed by his brother , historical facts in the novel which point to vlad iii : the count's identity is later speculated on by professor van helsing : many of stoker's biographers and literary critics have found strong similarities to the earlier irish writer sheridan le fanu's classic of the vampire genre " carmilla " .
in writing " dracula " , stoker may also have drawn on stories about the sídhe , some of which feature blood-drinking women .
the irish legend of abhartach has also been suggested as a source .
it is also thought probable that his mothers stories of events during the severe cholera outbreak in sligo in *num* were influential .
particularly themes of being buried while alive .
in *num* , mcnally additionally suggested that stoker was influenced by the history of hungarian countess elizabeth bathory , who allegedly tortured and killed between *num* and *num* young women .
it was later a commonly believed rumor that she committed these crimes to bathe in their blood , believing that this preserved her youth .
báthory's castle was also located in the carpathian mountains , just as dracula's , albeit in a different region .
in her book " the essential dracula " , clare haword-maden suggested that the castle of count dracula was inspired by slains castle , at which bram stoker was a guest of the *ord* earl of erroll .
according to miller , he first visited cruden bay in *num* , three years after work had begun on " dracula " .
haining and tremaine maintain that , during this visit , stoker was especially impressed by slains castle's interior and the surrounding landscape .
miller and leatherdale question the stringency of this connection .
possibly , stoker was not inspired by a real edifice at all , but by jules verne's novel " the carpathian castle " ( *num* ) or anne radcliffe's " the mysteries of udolpho " ( *num* ) .
a third possibility is that he copied information about kemény castle at vécs from one of his sources on transylvania , the book by major e .
c .
johnson .
a further option is that stoker saw an illustration of castle bran ( törzburg ) in the book on transylvania by charles boner , or read about it in the books by mazuchelli or crosse .
many of the scenes in whitby and london are based on real places that stoker frequently visited , although he distorts the geography for the sake of the story in some cases .
one scholar has suggested that stoker chose whitby as the site of dracula's first appearance in england because of the synod of whitby , given the novel's preoccupation with timekeeping and calendar disputes .
daniel farson , leonard wolf , and peter haining have suggested that stoker received much historical information from ármin vámbéry , a hungarian professor whom he met at least twice .
miller argues , " there is nothing to indicate that the conversation included vlad , vampires , or even transylvania " , and " furthermore , there is no record of any other correspondence between stoker and vámbéry , nor is vámbéry mentioned in stoker's notes for dracula .
" the short story " dracula's guest " was posthumously published in *num* , two years after stoker's death .
it was , according to most contemporary critics , the deleted first ( or second ) chapter from the original manuscript and the one which gave the volume its name , but which the original publishers deemed unnecessary to the overall story .
"dracula's guest " follows an unnamed englishman traveller as he wanders around munich before leaving for transylvania .
it is walpurgis night and the young englishman foolishly leaves his hotel , in spite of the coachman's warnings , and wanders through a dense forest alone .
along the way , he feels that he is being watched by a tall and thin stranger ( possibly count dracula ) .
the short story climaxes in an old graveyard where the englishman , caught in a blizzard , takes refuge in the marble tomb of " countess dolingen of gratz " .
within the tomb , he sees the countess—apparently asleep and healthy—but before he can investigate further , a mysterious force throws him clear of the tomb .
a lightning bolt then strikes the tomb , destroying it and incinerating the undead screaming countess .
the englishman then loses consciousness .
he awakens to find a " gigantic " wolf lying on his chest and licking at his throat ; however , the wolf merely keeps him warm and protects him until help arrives .
when the englishman is finally taken back to his hotel , a telegram awaits him from his expectant host dracula , with a warning about " dangers from snow and wolves and night " .
in *num* , an official sequel was published , written by bram stoker's great grand-nephew dacre stoker and ian holt .
dacre stoker and j .
d .
barker will write a prequel to " dracula " titled " dracul " .
an interpretation of the missing *num* pages of the original novel , it was pieced together from bram stoker's editorial notes , artifacts , and journals .
the story of " dracula " has been the basis for numerous films and plays .
stoker himself wrote the first theatrical adaptation , which was presented at the lyceum theatre on *num* may *num* under the title " dracula , or the undead " shortly before the novel's publication and performed only once , in order to establish his own copyright for such adaptations .
this adaption was first published only a century later in october *num* .
the first motion picture to feature dracula was " dracula's death " , produced in hungary in *num* .
the now-lost film , however , was not an adaptation of stoker's novel , but featured an original story .
f .
w .
murnau's unauthorised film adaptation " nosferatu " was released in *num* , and the popularity of the novel increased considerably , owing to an attempt by stoker's widow to have the film removed from public circulation .
prana film , the production company , had been unable to obtain permission to adapt the story from bram's widow florence stoker , so screenwriter henrik galeen was told to alter numerous details to avoid legal trouble .
galeen transplanted the action of the story from 1890s england to 1830s germany and reworked several characters , dropping some ( such as lucy and all three of her suitors ) , and renaming others ( dracula became orlok , jonathan harker became thomas hutter , mina became ellen , and so on ) .
this attempt failed to avoid a court case , however ; florence stoker sued prana film , and all copies of the film were ordered to be destroyed .
however , the company was bankrupt , and stoker only recovered her legal fees in damages .
some copies survived and found their way into theatres .
eventually , florence stoker gave up the fight against public displays of the film .
subsequent rereleases of the film have typically undone some of the changes , such as restoring the original character names ( a practice also followed by werner herzog in his *num* remake of murnau's film " nosferatu the vampyre " ) .
florence stoker licensed the story to playwright hamilton deane , whose *num* stage play adaptation toured england for several years before settling down in london .
in *num* , american stage producer horace liveright hired john l .
balderston to revise deane's script in advance of its american premiere .
balderston significantly compressed the story , most notably consolidating or removing several characters .
the deane play and its balderston revisions introduced an expanded role and history for renfield , who now replaced jonathan harker as dracula's solicitor in the first part of the story ; combined mina harker and lucy westenra into a single character ( named lucy ) ; and omitted both arthur holmwood and quincey morris entirely .
when the play premiered in new york , it was with bela lugosi in the title role , and with edward van sloan as abraham van helsing , roles which both actors ( as well as herbert bunston as dr .
seward ) reprised for the english-language version of the *num* universal studios film production .
the *num* film was one of the most commercially successful adaptations of the story to date ; it and the deane / balderston play that preceded it set the standard for film and television adaptations of the story , with the alterations to the novel becoming standard for later adaptations for decades to come .
universal studios continued to feature the character of dracula in many of their horror films from the 1930s and 1940s .
in *num* , british film company hammer film productions followed the success of its " the curse of frankenstein " from the previous year with " dracula " , released in the us as " horror of dracula " , directed by terence fisher .
fisher's production featured christopher lee as dracula and peter cushing as van helsing .
it was an international hit for hammer film , and lee fixed the image of the fanged vampire in popular culture .
both lee and cushing reprised their roles multiple times over the next decade and a half , concluding with " the legend of the *num* golden vampires " ( with cushing but not lee ) in *num* .
christopher lee also took on the role of dracula in " count dracula " , a *num* spanish-italian-german coproduction notable for its adherence to the plot of the original novel .
playing the part of renfield in that version was klaus kinski , who later played dracula himself in 1979's " nosferatu the vampyre " .
in *num* , the bbc made " count dracula " , a 155-minute adaptation for television starring louis jourdan .
later film adaptations include john badham's *num* " dracula " , starring frank langella and inspired by the *num* broadway revival of the deane / hamilton play , and francis ford coppola's *num* " bram stoker's dracula " , starring gary oldman .
the character of count dracula has remained popular over the years , and many films have used the character as a villain , while others have named him in their titles , including " dracula's daughter " and " the brides of dracula " .
as of *num* , an estimated *num* films feature dracula in a major role , a number second only to sherlock holmes ( *num* films ) .
a large number of these appearances are not adaptations of stoker's novel , but merely feature the character in an unrelated story .
caitlin clarke caitlin clarke ( may *num* , *num* – september *num* , *num* ) was an american theater and film actress best known for her role as valerian in the *num* fantasy film " dragonslayer " and for her role as charlotte cardoza in the 1998–1999 broadway musical " titanic " .

alvin toffler alvin toffler ( october *num* , *num* – june *num* , *num* ) was an american writer , futurist , and businessman known for his works discussing modern technologies , including the digital revolution and the communication revolution , with emphasis on their effects on cultures worldwide .
toffler was an associate editor of " fortune " magazine .
in his early works he focused on technology and its impact , which he termed " information overload .
" in *num* his first major book about the future , " future shock " , became a worldwide best-seller and has sold over *num* million copies .
he and his wife heidi toffler , who collaborated with him for most of his writings , moved on to examining the reaction to changes in society with another best-selling book , " the third wave " in *num* .
in it , he foresaw such technological advances as cloning , personal computers , the internet , cable television and mobile communication .
his later focus , via their other best-seller , " powershift " , ( *num* ) , was on the increasing power of 21st-century military hardware and the proliferation of new technologies .
he founded toffler associates , a management consulting company , and was a visiting scholar at the russell sage foundation , visiting professor at cornell university , faculty member of the new school for social research , a white house correspondent , and a business consultant .
toffler's ideas and writings were a significant influence on the thinking of business and government leaders worldwide , including china's zhao ziyang , and aol founder steve case .
alvin toffler was born on october *num* , *num* , in new york city , and raised in brooklyn .
he was the son of rose ( albaum ) and sam toffler , a furrier , both jewish immigrants from poland .
he had one younger sister .
he was inspired to become a writer at the age of *num* by his aunt and uncle , who lived with the tofflers .
" they were depression-era literary intellectuals , " toffler said , " and they always talked about exciting ideas .
" toffler graduated from new york university in *num* as an english major , though by his own account he was more focused on political activism than grades .
he met his future wife , adelaide elizabeth farrell ( nicknamed " heidi " ) , when she was starting a graduate course in linguistics .
being radical students , they decided against further graduate work and moved to the midwest , where they married on april *num* , *num* .
seeking experiences to write about , alvin and heidi toffler spent the next five years as blue collar workers on assembly lines while studying industrial mass production in their daily work .
he compared his own desire for experience to other writers , such as jack london , who in his quest for subjects to write about sailed the seas , and john steinbeck , who went to pick grapes with migrant workers .
in their first factory jobs , heidi became a union shop steward in the aluminum foundry where she worked .
alvin became a millwright and welder .
in the evenings alvin would write poetry and fiction , but discovered he was proficient at neither .
his hands-on practical labor experience helped alvin toffler land a position at a union-backed newspaper , a transfer to its washington bureau in *num* , then three years as a white house correspondent , covering congress and the white house for a pennsylvania daily newspaper .
they returned to new york city in *num* when " fortune " magazine invited alvin to become its labor columnist , later having him write about business and management .
after leaving " fortune " magazine in *num* , toffler began a freelance career , writing long form articles for scholarly journals and magazines .
his *num* " playboy interviews " with russian novelist vladimir nabokov and ayn rand were considered among the magazine's best .
his interview with rand was the first time the magazine had given such a platform to a female intellectual , which as one commentator said , " the real bird of paradise toffler captured for playboy in *num* was ayn rand .
" toffler was hired by ibm to conduct research and write a paper on the social and organizational impact of computers , leading to his contact with the earliest computer " gurus " and artificial intelligence researchers and proponents .
xerox invited him to write about its research laboratory and at&t consulted him for strategic advice .
this at&t work led to a study of telecommunications , which advised the company's top management to break up the company more than a decade before the government forced at&t to break up .
in the mid-1960s , the tofflers began five years of research on what would become " future shock " , published in *num* .
it has sold over *num* million copies worldwide , according to the " new york times , " or over *num* million copies according to the tofflers ' web site .
toffler coined the term " future shock " to refer to what happens to a society when change happens too fast , which results in social confusion and normal decision-making processes breaking down .
the book has never been out of print and has been translated into dozens of languages .
he continued the theme in " the third wave " in *num* .
while he describes the first and second waves as the agricultural and industrial revolutions , the " third wave , " a phrase he coined , represents the current information , computer-based revolution .
he forecast the spread of the internet and email , interactive media , cable television , cloning , and other digital advancements .
he claimed that one of the side effects of the digital age has been " information overload , " another term he coined .
in *num* he wrote " powershift " , also with the help of his wife , heidi .
in *num* , with american business consultant tom johnson , they co-founded toffler associates , an advisory firm designed to implement many of the ideas the tofflers had written on .
the firm worked with businesses , ngos , and governments in the united states , south korea , mexico , brazil , singapore , australia , and other countries .
during this period in his career , toffler lectured worldwide , taught at several schools and met world leaders , such as mikhail gorbachev , along with key executives and military officials .
toffler stated many of his ideas during an interview with the australian broadcasting corporation in *num* .
among a few of his opinions , he said that " society needs people who take care of the elderly and who know how to be compassionate and honest .
society needs people who work in hospitals .
society needs all kinds of skills that are not just cognitive ; they're emotional , they're affectional .
you can't run the society on data and computers alone .
" his opinions about the future of education , many of which were in " future shock " , have often been quoted .
an often misattributed quote , however , is that of psychologist herbert gerjuoy : " tomorrow's illiterate will not be the man who can't read ; he will be the man who has not learned how to learn .
" early in his career , after traveling to other countries , he became aware of the new and myriad inputs that visitors received from these other cultures .
he explained during an interview that some visitors would become " truly disoriented and upset " by the strange environment , which he described as a reaction to culture shock .
from that issue , he foresaw another problem for the future , when a culturally " new environment comes to you .
.
.
and comes to you rapidly .
" that kind of sudden cultural change within one's own country , which he felt many would not understand , would lead to a similar reaction , one of " future shock " , which he wrote about in his book by that title .
toffler writes : in his book " the third wave " , toffler describes three types of societies , based on the concept of " waves" — each wave pushes the older societies and cultures aside .
he describes the " first wave " as the society after agrarian revolution and replaced the first hunter-gatherer cultures .
the " second wave , " he labels society during the industrial revolution ( ca .
late *ord* century through the *ord* century ) .
that period saw the increase of urban industrial populations which had undermined the traditional nuclear family , and initiated a factory-like education system , and the growth of the corporation .
toffler said : the " third wave " was a term he coined to describe the post-industrial society , which began in the late 1950s .
his description of this period dovetails with other futurist writers , who also wrote about the information age , space age , electronic era , global village , terms which highlighted a scientific-technological revolution .
the tofflers claimed to have predicted a number of geopolitical events , such as the collapse of the soviet union , the fall of the berlin wall and the future economic growth in the asia-pacific region .
toffler often visited with dignitaries in asia , including china's zhao ziyang , singapore's lee kuan yew and south korea's kim dae jung , all of whom were influenced by his views as asia's emerging markets increased in global significance during the 1980s and 1990s .
although they had originally censored some of his books and ideas , china's government cited him along with franklin roosevelt and bill gates as being among the westerners who had most influenced their country .
" the third wave " along with a video documentary based on it became best-sellers in china and were widely distributed to schools .
toffler's influence on asian thinkers was summed up in an article in " daedulus " , published by the american academy of arts & sciences : u .
s .
house speaker newt gingrich publicly lauded his ideas about the future , and urged members of congress to read toffler's book , " creating a new civilization " ( *num* ) .
others , such as aol founder steve case , cited toffler's " the third wave " as a formative influence on his thinking , which inspired him to write " the third wave : an entrepreneur's vision of the future " in *num* .
case said that toffler was a " real pioneer in helping people , companies and even countries lean into the future .
" in *num* ted turner founded cnn , which he said was inspired by toffler's forecasting the end of the dominance of the three main television networks .
turner's company , turner broadcasting , published toffler's " creating a new civilization " in *num* .
shortly after the book was released , russian president mikhail gorbachev hosted the global governance conference in san francisco with the theme , " toward a new civilization " , which was attended by dozens of world figures , including the tofflers , george h .
w .
bush , margaret thatcher , carl sagan , abba eban and turner with his then-wife , actress jane fonda .
mexican billionaire carlos slim was influenced by his works , and became a friend of the writer .
and global marketer j .
d .
power also said he was inspired by toffler's works .
since the 1960s , people had tried to make sense out of the effect of new technologies and social change , a problem which made toffler's writings widely influential beyond the confines of scientific , economic , and public policy .
his works and ideas have been subject to various criticisms , usually with the same argumentation used against futurology : that foreseeing the future is nigh impossible .
techno music pioneer juan atkins cites toffler's phrase " techno rebels " in " the third wave " as inspiring him to use the word " techno " to describe the musical style he helped to create musicians curtis mayfield and herbie hancock both wrote songs called " future shock .
" science fiction author john brunner wrote " the shockwave rider , " from the concept of " future shock .
" the nightclub toffler , in rotterdam , is named after him .
accenture , the management consultancy firm , identified toffler in *num* as being among the most influential voices in business leaders , along with bill gates and peter drucker .
toffler has also been described in a " financial times " interview as the " world's most famous futurologist " .
in *num* the " people's daily " classed him among the *num* foreigners who shaped modern china , which one u .
s .
newspaper notes made him a " guru of sorts to world statesmen .
" prime minister zhao ziyang of china convened conferences to discuss " the third wave " in the early 1980s , and in *num* the book was the no .
*num* best seller in china .
author mark satin characterizes toffler as an important early influence on radical centrist political thought .
newt gingrich became close to the tofflers in the 1970s and said " the third wave " had immensely influenced his own thinking and was " one of the great seminal works of our time .
" toffler has received several prestigious prizes awards , including the mckinsey foundation book award for contributions to management literature , officier de l'ordre des arts et lettres , and appointments , including fellow of the american association for the advancement of science and the international institute for strategic studies .
in *num* , the alvin and heidi toffler were recipients of brown university's independent award .
toffler was married to heidi toffler , also a writer and futurist .
they lived in the bel air section of los angeles , california , and previously lived in redding , connecticut .
the couple's only child , karen toffler ( 1954–2000 ) , died at age *num* after more than a decade suffering from guillain–barré syndrome .
alvin toffler died in his sleep on june *num* , *num* , at his home in los angeles .
no cause of death was given .
alvin toffler co-wrote his books with his wife heidi .
british and irish lions the british & irish lions is a rugby union team selected from players eligible for any of the home nations – the national teams of england , scotland , wales and ireland .
the lions are a test side , and generally select international players , but they can pick uncapped players available to any one of the four unions .
the team currently tours every four years , with these rotating among australia , new zealand , and south africa .
the *num* test series was lost to south africa , while the *num* test series was won over australia .
the most recent series , the *num* series against new zealand , was drawn 1-1 ( with one match drawn ) .
from *num* onwards combined rugby sides from the united kingdom of great britain and ireland toured the southern hemisphere .
the first tour was a commercial venture , and was undertaken without official backing .
the six subsequent visits enjoyed a growing degree of support from the authorities , before the *num* south africa tour , which was the first tour representative of the four home unions .
in *num* the four home unions formally created a tours committee and for the first time , every player of the *num* lions squad had played internationally before the tour .
the 1950s tours saw high win rates in provincial games , but the test series were typically lost or drawn .
the winning series in *num* ( new zealand ) and *num* ( south africa ) changed this pattern .
the last tour of the amateur age took place in *num* .
the lions have also played occasional matches in the northern hemisphere either as one-off exhibitions or as an element of a tour which mostly took place in the southern hemisphere .
the multi-nation team that is today named the british and irish lions first came into existence in *num* as the shaw and shrewsbury team .
it was then primarily english in composition but also contained players from scotland and wales .
later the team used the name british isles .
on their *num* tour of new zealand and australia they officially adopted the name british lions , the nickname first used by british and south african journalists on the *num* south african tour after the lion emblem on their ties , the emblem on their jerseys having been dropped in favour of the four-quartered badge with the symbols of the four represented unions .
when the team first emerged in the *ord* century , it represented the united kingdom of great britain and ireland , then one single state .
the team continued to exist after the irish war of independence and civil war and the subsequent division of ireland in *num* into the irish free state ( later the republic of ireland ) and northern ireland .
to avoid ambiguity and possible offence to irish players , it was later decided to define the team's identity as representing the two sovereign states – the united kingdom and ireland – with the team members being either " british " or " irish " .
from the *num* tour of australia , the official name british and irish lions has been used .
the team is often referred to simply as the lions .
as the lions represent two sovereign states , they do not have a national anthem .
however , for the *num* tour , the british national anthem " god save the queen " was used .
for the *num* tour to new zealand , the lions management commissioned a song , " the power of four " , although it was met with little support among lions fans at the matches and has not been used since .
for more than half a century , the lions have been synonymous with the red jersey that sports the amalgamated crests of the four unions .
however , prior to *num* the strip went through a number of significantly different formats .
in *num* , the promoter of the first expedition to australia and new zealand , arthur shrewsbury , demanded " something that would be good material and yet take them by storm out here " .
the result was a jersey in thick red , white and blue hoops , worn above white shorts and dark socks .
the tours to south africa in *num* and *num* retained the red , white and blue theme but this time as red and white hooped jerseys and dark blue shorts and socks .
the *num* trip to australia saw a reversion to red , white and blue jerseys , but with the blue used in thick hoops and the red and white in thin bands .
the shorts remained blue , as did the socks although a white flash was added to the latter .
the one-off test in *num* between england and australia that was played to commemorate australia's first test against reverend matthew mullineux's british side saw england wear an updated version of this jersey .
in *num* , the south africa tour followed on from the *num* tour , with red and white hooped jerseys .
the slight differences were that the red hoops were slightly thicker than the white ( the opposite was true in *num* ) , and the white flash on the socks introduced in *num* was partially retained .
the australia tour of *num* saw exactly the same kit as in *num* , and it seemed that the british touring sides had settled on kits particular to the host destination .
however , in *num* with the scottish and irish unions refusing to be involved , the anglo-welsh side only sported red jerseys with a thick white band on their jerseys on tour to australia and new zealand .
blue shorts were retained , but the socks were for the first time red , with a white flash .
the scots were once again involved in dr tom smyth's *num* team to south africa .
thus , dark blue jerseys , were introduced with white shorts and the red socks of *num* .
the jerseys also had a single lion-rampant crest .
the *num* tour returned to south africa , retaining the blue jerseys but now with shorts to match .
it is the *num* tour that is credited as being the first in which the team were referred to as " the lions " , the irony being that it was on this tour that the single lion-rampant crest was replaced with the forerunner of the four-quartered badge with the symbols of the four represented unions , that is still worn today .
although the lion had been dropped from the jersey , the players had worn the lion motif on their ties as they arrived in south africa , which led the press and public referring to them as " the lions " .
the unofficial *num* argentina tour used the same kit and badge .
so powerful was the attribution of " the lions " nickname that three heraldic versions of the animal returned as the jersey badge in *num* .
this was the tour to new zealand where the tourists ' now standard blue jerseys caused some controversy .
the convention in rugby is for the home side to accommodate its guests when there is a clash of kit .
the new zealand side , by then already synonymous with the appellation " all blacks " , had an all black kit that clashed with the lions ' blue .
after much reluctance and debate new zealand agreed to change for the tests and the all blacks became the all whites for the first time .
on the *num* tour a delegation led by the irish lock george beamish expressed their displeasure at the fact that whilst the blue of scotland , white of england and red of wales were represented in the strip there was no green for ireland .
a green flash was added to the socks , which from *num* became a green turnover ( although on blue socks thus eliminating red from the kit ) , and that has remained a feature of the strip ever since .
in *num* , the four-quartered badge returned for the tour to argentina and has remained on the kits ever since , but other than that the strip remained the same .
the adoption of the red jersey happened in the *num* tour .
a return to new zealand was accompanied by a desire to avoid the controversy of *num* and so red replaced blue for the jersey with the resultant kit being that which is still worn today , the combination of red jersey , white shorts and green and blue socks , representing the four unions .
the only additions to the strip since *num* began appearing in *num* , with the addition of kit suppliers logos in prominent positions .
umbro had in *num* asked for " maximum brand exposure whenever possible " but this did not affect the kit's appearance .
since then , nike , adidas and canterbury have had more overt branding on the shirts , with sponsors scottish provident ( *num* ) , ( *num* ) , zurich ( *num* ) , hsbc ( *num* and *num* ) and standard life investments ( *num* ) .
the earliest tours date back to *num* , when a 21-man squad visited australia and new zealand .
the squad drew players from england , scotland and wales , though english players predominated .
the 35-match tour of two host nations included no tests , but the side played provincial , city and academic sides , winning *num* matches .
they played *num* games of australian rules football , against prominent clubs in victoria and south australia , winning six and drawing one of these ( see australian rules football in england ) .
the first tour , although unsanctioned by rugby bodies , established the concept of northern hemisphere sporting sides touring to the southern hemisphere .
three years after the first tour , the western province union invited rugby bodies in britain to tour south africa .
some saw the *num* team – the first sanctioned by the rugby football union – as the english national team , though others referred to it as " the british isles " .
the tourists played a total of twenty matches , three of them tests .
the team also played the regional side of south africa ( south africa did not exist as a political unit in *num* ) , winning all three matches .
in a notable event of the tour , the touring side presented the currie cup to griqualand west , the province they thought produced the best performance on the tour .
five years later a british isles side returned to south africa .
they played one extra match on this tour , making the total of *num* games , including four tests against south africa , with the british isles winning three of them .
the squad had a notable irish orientation , with the irish national team contributing six players to the 21-man squad .
in *num* the british isles touring side returned to australia for the first time since the unofficial tour of *num* .
the squad of *num* for the first time ever had players from each of the home nations .
the team again participated in *num* matches , playing state teams as well as northern queensland sides and victorian teams .
a four-test series took place against australia , the tourists winning three out of the four .
the team returned via hawaii and canada playing additional games en route .
four years later , in *num* , the british isles team returned to south africa .
the opening performance of the side proved disappointing from the tourists ' point of view , with defeats in its opening three matches by western province sides in cape town .
from then on the team experienced mixed results , though more wins than losses .
the side lost the test series to south africa , drawing twice , but with the south africans winning the decider *num* to nil .
no more than twelve months passed before the british isles team ventured to australia and new zealand in *num* .
the tourists devastated the australian teams , winning every single game .
australia also lost all three tests to the visitors , even getting held to a standstill in two of the three games .
though the new zealand leg of the tour did not take long in comparison to the number of australian games , the british isles experienced considerable difficulty across the tasman after whitewashing the australians .
the team managed two early wins before losing the test to new zealand and only winning one more game as well as drawing once .
despite their difficulties in new zealand , the tour proved a raging success on-field for the british isles .
in *num* , another tour took place to australia and new zealand .
in a reversal of previous practice , the planners allocated more matches in new zealand rather than in australia : perhaps the strength of the new zealand teams and the heavy defeats of all australian teams on the previous tour influenced this decision .
some commentators thought that this tour hoped to reach out to rugby communities in australia , as rugby league ( infamously ) started in australia in *num* .
the anglo-welsh side ( irish and scottish unions did not participate ) performed well in all the non-test matches , but drew a test against new zealand and lost the other two .
visits that took place before the *num* south africa tour ( the first selected by a committee from the four home unions ) had enjoyed a growing degree of support from the authorities , although only one of these included representatives of all four nations .
the *num* tour to south africa marked the official beginning of british isles rugby tours : the inaugural tour operating under all four unions .
the team performed moderately against the non-test parties , claiming victories in just over half their matches .
the test series , however , went to south africa , who won two of the three games .
a side managed by oxford university — supposedly the england rugby team , but actually including three scottish players — toured argentina at the time : the people of argentina termed it the " combined british " .
the next british isles team tour did not take place until *num* , again in south africa .
the team , led by ronald cove-smith , struggled with injuries and lost three of the four test matches , drawing the other 3–3 .
in total , *num* games were played , with the touring side winning *num* , drawing *num* and losing *num* .
in *num* a short , nine-game series took place in argentina , with the british isles winning all nine encounters ; the tour did however become a financial success for argentine rugby .
after a seemingly long absence from new zealand , the lions returned in *num* to some success .
the lions won all of their games that did not have test status except for the matches against auckland , wellington and canterbury ; they did however lose three of their four test matches against new zealand , winning the first test 6–3 .
the side also visited australia , losing a test but winning five out of the six non-test games .
in *num* the british isles visited argentina for the third time , winning all ten of their matches and only conceding nine points in the whole tour .
two years later in *num* the british isles toured in south africa , winning more than half of their normal matches .
despite having lost the test series to south africa by game three , they won the final test .
this is when they were named the lions by their then captain sam walker .
the first post-war tour went to new zealand and australia in *num* .
the lions , sporting newly redesigned jerseys and displaying a fresh style of play , managed to win *num* and draw one of *num* matches over the two nations .
the lions won the opening four fixtures before losing to otago and southland , but succeeded in holding the all blacks to a 9–9 draw .
the lions performed well in the remaining all black tests though they lost all three , the team did not lose another non-test in the new zealand leg of the tour .
the lions won all their games in australia except for their final fixture against a new south wales xv in newcastle .
they won both tests against australia , in brisbane , queensland and in sydney .
in *num* the lions toured south africa and left with another imposing record , one draw and *num* wins from the *num* fixtures .
the four-test series against south africa , a thrilling affair , ended in a drawn series .
the *num* tour to australia and new zealand marked once again a very successful tour for the lions , who only lost six of their *num* fixtures .
the lions easily won both tests against australia and lost the first three tests against new zealand , but did find victory ( 9–6 ) in the final test .
after the glittering decade of the 1950s , the first tour of the 1960s proved not nearly as successful as previous ones .
the *num* tour to south africa saw the lions still win *num* of their *num* games , but did not fare well against the springboks , losing three of the four tests .
for the *num* tour to australia and new zealand john robins became the first lions coach , and the trip started off very well for the lions , who stormed through australia , winning five non-tests and drawing one ; and most notably defeating australia in two tests as well .
the lions however experienced mixed results during the new zealand leg of the tour , as well as losing all of the tests against the all blacks .
the lions also played a test against canada on their way home , winning *num* to *num* in toronto .
the *num* tour of south africa saw the lions win *num* of their *num* provincial matches , but the team actually lost three tests against the springboks and drew one .
the 1970s saw a renaissance for the lions .
the *num* team , centred around the skilled welsh half-back pairing of gareth edwards and barry john , secured a series win over the all blacks .
the tour started with a loss to queensland but proceeded to storm through the next provincial fixtures , winning *num* games in a row .
the lions then went on to defeat the all blacks in dunedin .
the lions would only lose a single match on the rest of the tour , and won the test series against new zealand , winning and drawing the last two games , to take the series two wins to one .
one of the best-known and most successful lions team toured south africa in *num* under the esteemed irish forward willie john mcbride .
it went through *num* games unbeaten , and triumphed 3–0 ( with one drawn ) in the test open series .
the test series featured a lot of violence .
the management of the lions concluded that the springboks dominated their opponents with physical aggression .
at that time , test match referees came from the home nation , substitutions took place only if a doctor found a player unable to continue and there were no video cameras or sideline officials to prevent violent play .
the lions decided " to get their retaliation in first " with the infamous " *num* call " .
the lions postulated that a south african referee would probably not send off all of the lions if they all retaliated against " blatant thuggery " .
famous video footage of the ' battle of boet erasmus stadium ' shows jpr williams running over half of the pitch and launching himself at van heerden after such a call .
the *num* tour to new zealand saw the lions drop only one non-test out of *num* games , a loss to a universities side .

a tour to south africa by the lions was anticipated in *num* .
however , the invitation for the lions to tour south africa was never accepted because of controversy surrounding apartheid , and the tour did not go ahead .
the lions did not return to south africa until *num* , after the apartheid era .

australia did have a chance to take the win in the final moments of the game , but a missed penalty by kurtley beale saw the lions take the win .
the wallabies drew the series in the second test winning 16–15 , though the lions had a chance to steal the win had it not been because of a missed penalty by leigh halfpenny .
with tour captain warburton out of the final test due to injury , alun wyn jones took over the captaincy in the final test in sydney .
the final test was won by the lions in what was a record win , winning 41–16 to earn their first series win since *num* and their first over australia since *num* .

overall test matches updated after the *num* tour overall tour results the lions tour three southern hemisphere nations ; australia , south africa and new zealand .
they also routinely toured in argentina before the second world war .
tours currently take place every four years .
the most recent tour was to new zealand in *num* , and before that the lions toured visited australia in june–july *num* .
in a break with tradition , a " home " fixture against argentina took place at millennium stadium in cardiff on *num* may *num* , before the lions went to new zealand .
it finished in a draw , 25–25 .
on tour , games take place against local provinces , clubs or representative sides as well as the full tests against the host's national team .
the lions , and their predecessor teams , have often played games against other nearby countries on tour .
for example , they played rhodesia ( the future zimbabwe ) in *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* & *num* during their tours to south africa .
they also were beaten by fiji on their *num* tour to new zealand .
in addition , they toured pre-independence namibia ( then south west africa ) , in *num* , *num* , *num* , and *num* .
there have also been games in other countries on the way home .
these include games in in *num* and *num* , east africa ( then mostly kenya , and held in nairobi ) , and an unofficial game against ceylon ( future sri lanka ) in *num* .
previous tours have seen some non-test players become demotivated , but more recently this issue has reduced because of high injury rates , increased use of replacements and greater selection flexibility .
in recent tours a common issue has been weak opposition in many non-test games , partly as opposition countries have their top players in national training camps , partly as sides protect top players for domestic games which are seen as more commercially important than lions games , and possibly partly to prevent the lions having high standard preparatory games .
however , quite a few new zealand internationals lined out in non-test matches in *num* .
the lions have played a number of " home matches " against international opposition .
with the exception of the *num* home match against argentina ( which was played as a warm-up to the *num* british and irish lions tour to new zealand ) , these matches have been one-offs to mark special occasions : "players in bold are still active at club level .

they are named after the dutch physicist hendrik casimir who predicted them in *num* .
the casimir effect can be understood by the idea that the presence of conducting metals and dielectrics alters the vacuum expectation value of the energy of the second quantized electromagnetic field .
since the value of this energy depends on the shapes and positions of the conductors and dielectrics , the casimir effect manifests itself as a force between such objects .
any medium supporting oscillations has an analogue of the casimir effect .
for example , beads on a string as well as plates submerged in noisy water or gas illustrate the casimir force .
in modern theoretical physics , the casimir effect plays an important role in the chiral bag model of the nucleon ; in applied physics it is significant in some aspects of emerging microtechnologies and nanotechnologies .
the typical example is of the two uncharged conductive plates in a vacuum , placed a few nanometers apart .
in a classical description , the lack of an external field means that there is no field between the plates , and no force would be measured between them .
when this field is instead studied using the quantum electrodynamic vacuum , it is seen that the plates do affect the virtual photons which constitute the field , and generate a net force – either an attraction or a repulsion depending on the specific arrangement of the two plates .
although the casimir effect can be expressed in terms of virtual particles interacting with the objects , it is best described and more easily calculated in terms of the zero-point energy of a quantized field in the intervening space between the objects .
this force has been measured and is a striking example of an effect captured formally by second quantization .
the treatment of boundary conditions in these calculations has led to some controversy .
in fact , " casimir's original goal was to compute the van der waals force between polarizable molecules " of the conductive plates .
thus it can be interpreted without any reference to the zero-point energy ( vacuum energy ) of quantum fields .
because the strength of the force falls off rapidly with distance , it is measurable only when the distance between the objects is extremely small .
on a submicron scale , this force becomes so strong that it becomes the dominant force between uncharged conductors .
in fact , at separations of *num* nm – about *num* times the typical size of an atom – the casimir effect produces the equivalent of about *num* atmosphere of pressure ( the precise value depending on surface geometry and other factors ) .
dutch physicists hendrik casimir and dirk polder at philips research labs proposed the existence of a force between two polarizable atoms and between such an atom and a conducting plate in *num* ; this special form is called the casimir–polder force .
after a conversation with niels bohr , who suggested it had something to do with zero-point energy , casimir alone formulated the theory predicting a force between neutral conducting plates in *num* which is called the casimir effect in the narrow sense .
predictions of the force were later extended to finite-conductivity metals and dielectrics , and recent calculations have considered more general geometries .
experiments before *num* had observed the force qualitatively , and indirect validation of the predicted casimir energy had been made by measuring the thickness of liquid helium films .
however it was not until *num* that a direct experiment by s .
lamoreaux quantitatively measured the force to within *num* % of the value predicted by the theory .
subsequent experiments approach an accuracy of a few percent .
the causes of the casimir effect are described by quantum field theory , which states that all of the various fundamental fields , such as the electromagnetic field , must be quantized at each and every point in space .
in a simplified view , a " field " in physics may be envisioned as if space were filled with interconnected vibrating balls and springs , and the strength of the field can be visualized as the displacement of a ball from its rest position .
vibrations in this field propagate and are governed by the appropriate wave equation for the particular field in question .
the second quantization of quantum field theory requires that each such ball-spring combination be quantized , that is , that the strength of the field be quantized at each point in space .
at the most basic level , the field at each point in space is a simple harmonic oscillator , and its quantization places a quantum harmonic oscillator at each point .
excitations of the field correspond to the elementary particles of particle physics .
however , even the vacuum has a vastly complex structure , so all calculations of quantum field theory must be made in relation to this model of the vacuum .
the vacuum has , implicitly , all of the properties that a particle may have : spin , or polarization in the case of light , energy , and so on .
on average , most of these properties cancel out : the vacuum is , after all , " empty " in this sense .
one important exception is the vacuum energy or the vacuum expectation value of the energy .
the quantization of a simple harmonic oscillator states that the lowest possible energy or zero-point energy that such an oscillator may have is summing over all possible oscillators at all points in space gives an infinite quantity .
since only " differences " in energy are physically measurable ( with the notable exception of gravitation , which remains beyond the scope of quantum field theory ) , this infinity may be considered a feature of the mathematics rather than of the physics .
this argument is the underpinning of the theory of renormalization .
dealing with infinite quantities in this way was a cause of widespread unease among quantum field theorists before the development in the 1970s of the renormalization group , a mathematical formalism for scale transformations that provides a natural basis for the process .
when the scope of the physics is widened to include gravity , the interpretation of this formally infinite quantity remains problematic .
there is currently no compelling explanation as to why it should not result in a cosmological constant that is many orders of magnitude larger than observed .
however , since we do not yet have any fully coherent quantum theory of gravity , there is likewise no compelling reason as to why it should .
the casimir effect for fermions can be understood as the spectral asymmetry of the fermion operator formula_2 , where it is known as the witten index .
alternatively , a *num* paper by robert jaffe of mit states that " casimir effects can be formulated and casimir forces can be computed without reference to zero-point energies .
they are relativistic , quantum forces between charges and currents .
the casimir force ( per unit area ) between parallel plates vanishes as alpha , the fine structure constant , goes to zero , and the standard result , which appears to be independent of alpha , corresponds to the alpha approaching infinity limit , " and that " the casimir force is simply the ( relativistic , retarded ) van der waals force between the metal plates .
" casimir and polder's original paper used this method to derive the casimir-polder force .
in *num* , schwinger , deradd , and milton published a similar derivation for the casimir effect between two parallel plates .
in fact , the description in terms of van der waals forces is the only correct description from the fundamental microscopic perspective , while other descriptions of casimir force are merely effective macroscopic descriptions .
casimir's observation was that the second-quantized quantum electromagnetic field , in the presence of bulk bodies such as metals or dielectrics , must obey the same boundary conditions that the classical electromagnetic field must obey .
in particular , this affects the calculation of the vacuum energy in the presence of a conductor or dielectric .
consider , for example , the calculation of the vacuum expectation value of the electromagnetic field inside a metal cavity , such as , for example , a radar cavity or a microwave waveguide .
in this case , the correct way to find the zero-point energy of the field is to sum the energies of the standing waves of the cavity .
to each and every possible standing wave corresponds an energy ; say the energy of the " n"th standing wave is formula_3 .
the vacuum expectation value of the energy of the electromagnetic field in the cavity is then with the sum running over all possible values of " n " enumerating the standing waves .
the factor of *num* / *num* is present because the zero-point energy of the n'th mode is formula_5 , where formula_3 is the energy increment for the n'th mode .
( it is the same *num* / *num* as appears in the equation formula_7 .
) written in this way , this sum is clearly divergent ; however , it can be used to create finite expressions .
in particular , one may ask how the zero-point energy depends on the shape " s " of the cavity .
each energy level formula_3 depends on the shape , and so one should write formula_9 for the energy level , and formula_10 for the vacuum expectation value .
at this point comes an important observation : the force at point " p " on the wall of the cavity is equal to the change in the vacuum energy if the shape " s " of the wall is perturbed a little bit , say by formula_11 , at point " p " .
that is , one has this value is finite in many practical calculations .
attraction between the plates can be easily understood by focusing on the one-dimensional situation .
suppose that a moveable conductive plate is positioned at a short distance " a " from one of two widely separated plates ( distance " l " apart ) .
with " a " « " l " , the states within the slot of width " a " are highly constrained so that the energy " e " of any one mode is widely separated from that of the next .
this is not the case in the large region " l " , where there is a large number ( numbering about " l " / " a " ) of states with energy evenly spaced between " e " and the next mode in the narrow slot – in other words , all slightly larger than " e " .
now on shortening " a " by d"a " ( *num* ) , the mode in the narrow slot shrinks in wavelength and therefore increases in energy proportional to −d"a" / "a " , whereas all the " l " / "a " states that lie in the large region lengthen and correspondingly decrease their energy by an amount proportional to d"a" / "l " ( note the denominator ) .
the two effects nearly cancel , but the net change is slightly negative , because the energy of all the " l" / "a " modes in the large region are slightly larger than the single mode in the slot .
thus the force is attractive : it tends to make " a " slightly smaller , the plates attracting each other across the thin slot .
in the original calculation done by casimir , he considered the space between a pair of conducting metal plates at distance formula_13 apart .
in this case , the standing waves are particularly easy to calculate , because the transverse component of the electric field and the normal component of the magnetic field must vanish on the surface of a conductor .
assuming the plates lie parallel to the " xy"-plane , the standing waves are where formula_15 stands for the electric component of the electromagnetic field , and , for brevity , the polarization and the magnetic components are ignored here .
here , formula_16 and formula_17 are the wave numbers in directions parallel to the plates , and is the wave-number perpendicular to the plates .
here , " n " is an integer , resulting from the requirement that ψ vanish on the metal plates .
the frequency of this wave is where " c " is the speed of light .
the vacuum energy is then the sum over all possible excitation modes .
since the area of the plates is large , we may sum by integrating over two of the dimensions in " k"-space .
the assumption of periodic boundary conditions yields , where " a " is the area of the metal plates , and a factor of *num* is introduced for the two possible polarizations of the wave .
this expression is clearly infinite , and to proceed with the calculation , it is convenient to introduce a regulator ( discussed in greater detail below ) .
the regulator will serve to make the expression finite , and in the end will be removed .
the zeta-regulated version of the energy per unit-area of the plate is in the end , the limit formula_22 is to be taken .
here " s " is just a complex number , not to be confused with the shape discussed previously .
this integral / sum is finite for " s " real and larger than *num* .
the sum has a pole at " s"=3 , but may be analytically continued to " s"=0 , where the expression is finite .
the above expression simplifies to : where polar coordinates formula_24 were introduced to turn the double integral into a single integral .
the formula_25 in front is the jacobian , and the formula_26 comes from the angular integration .
the integral converges if re [ " s " ] *num* , resulting in the sum diverges at " s " in the neighborhood of zero , but if the damping of large-frequency excitations corresponding to analytic continuation of the riemann zeta function to " s"=0 is assumed to make sense physically in some way , then one has but and so one obtains the analytic continuation has evidently lost an additive positive infinity , somehow exactly accounting for the zero-point energy ( not included above ) outside the slot between the plates , but which changes upon plate movement within a closed system .
the casimir force per unit area formula_31 for idealized , perfectly conducting plates with vacuum between them is where the force is negative , indicating that the force is attractive : by moving the two plates closer together , the energy is lowered .
the presence of formula_33 shows that the casimir force per unit area formula_31 is very small , and that furthermore , the force is inherently of quantum-mechanical origin .
note : in casimir's original derivation , a moveable conductive plate is positioned at a short distance " a " from one of two widely separated plates ( distance " l " apart ) .
the 0-point energy on " both " sides of the plate is considered .
instead of the above " ad hoc " analytic continuation assumption , non-convergent sums and integrals are computed using euler–maclaurin summation with a regularizing function ( e .
g .
, exponential regularization ) not so anomalous as formula_38 in the above .
casimir's analysis of idealized metal plates was generalized to arbitrary dielectric and realistic metal plates by lifshitz and his students .
using this approach , complications of the bounding surfaces , such as the modifications to the casimir force due to finite conductivity , can be calculated numerically using the tabulated complex dielectric functions of the bounding materials .
lifshitz's theory for two metal plates reduces to casimir's idealized *num* / "a " force law for large separations " a " much greater than the skin depth of the metal , and conversely reduces to the *num* / "a " force law of the london dispersion force ( with a coefficient called a hamaker constant ) for small " a " , with a more complicated dependence on " a " for intermediate separations determined by the dispersion of the materials .
lifshitz ' result was subsequently generalized to arbitrary multilayer planar geometries as well as to anisotropic and magnetic materials , but for several decades the calculation of casimir forces for non-planar geometries remained limited to a few idealized cases admitting analytical solutions .
for example , the force in the experimental sphere–plate geometry was computed with an approximation ( due to derjaguin ) that the sphere radius " r " is much larger than the separation " a " , in which case the nearby surfaces are nearly parallel and the parallel-plate result can be adapted to obtain an approximate " r" / "a " force ( neglecting both skin-depth and higher-order curvature effects ) .
however , in the 2000s a number of authors developed and demonstrated a variety of numerical techniques , in many cases adapted from classical computational electromagnetics , that are capable of accurately calculating casimir forces for arbitrary geometries and materials , from simple finite-size effects of finite plates to more complicated phenomena arising for patterned surfaces or objects of various shapes .
one of the first experimental tests was conducted by marcus sparnaay at philips in eindhoven ( netherlands ) , in *num* , in a delicate and difficult experiment with parallel plates , obtaining results not in contradiction with the casimir theory , but with large experimental errors .
some of the experimental details as well as some background information on how casimir , polder and sparnaay arrived at this point are highlighted in a *num* interview with marcus sparnaay .
the casimir effect was measured more accurately in *num* by steve k .
lamoreaux of los alamos national laboratory , and by umar mohideen and anushree roy of the university of california , riverside .
in practice , rather than using two parallel plates , which would require phenomenally accurate alignment to ensure they were parallel , the experiments use one plate that is flat and another plate that is a part of a sphere with a large radius .
in *num* , a group ( giacomo bressi , gianni carugno , roberto onofrio and giuseppe ruoso ) at the university of padua ( italy ) finally succeeded in measuring the casimir force between parallel plates using microresonators .
in order to be able to perform calculations in the general case , it is convenient to introduce a regulator in the summations .
this is an artificial device , used to make the sums finite so that they can be more easily manipulated , followed by the taking of a limit so as to remove the regulator .
the heat kernel or exponentially regulated sum is where the limit formula_40 is taken in the end .
the divergence of the sum is typically manifested as for three-dimensional cavities .
the infinite part of the sum is associated with the bulk constant " c " which " does not " depend on the shape of the cavity .
the interesting part of the sum is the finite part , which is shape-dependent .
the gaussian regulator is better suited to numerical calculations because of its superior convergence properties , but is more difficult to use in theoretical calculations .
other , suitably smooth , regulators may be used as well .
the zeta function regulator is completely unsuited for numerical calculations , but is quite useful in theoretical calculations .
in particular , divergences show up as poles in the complex " s " plane , with the bulk divergence at " s"=4 .
this sum may be analytically continued past this pole , to obtain a finite part at " s"=0 .
not every cavity configuration necessarily leads to a finite part ( the lack of a pole at " s"=0 ) or shape-independent infinite parts .
in this case , it should be understood that additional physics has to be taken into account .
in particular , at extremely large frequencies ( above the plasma frequency ) , metals become transparent to photons ( such as x-rays ) , and dielectrics show a frequency-dependent cutoff as well .
this frequency dependence acts as a natural regulator .
there are a variety of bulk effects in solid state physics , mathematically very similar to the casimir effect , where the cutoff frequency comes into explicit play to keep expressions finite .
( these are discussed in greater detail in " landau and lifshitz " , " theory of continuous media " .
) the casimir effect can also be computed using the mathematical mechanisms of functional integrals of quantum field theory , although such calculations are considerably more abstract , and thus difficult to comprehend .
in addition , they can be carried out only for the simplest of geometries .
however , the formalism of quantum field theory makes it clear that the vacuum expectation value summations are in a certain sense summations over so-called " virtual particles " .
more interesting is the understanding that the sums over the energies of standing waves should be formally understood as sums over the eigenvalues of a hamiltonian .
this allows atomic and molecular effects , such as the van der waals force , to be understood as a variation on the theme of the casimir effect .
thus one considers the hamiltonian of a system as a function of the arrangement of objects , such as atoms , in configuration space .
the change in the zero-point energy as a function of changes of the configuration can be understood to result in forces acting between the objects .
in the chiral bag model of the nucleon , the casimir energy plays an important role in showing the mass of the nucleon is independent of the bag radius .
in addition , the spectral asymmetry is interpreted as a non-zero vacuum expectation value of the baryon number , cancelling the topological winding number of the pion field surrounding the nucleon .
the dynamical casimir effect is the production of particles and energy from an accelerated " moving mirror " .
this reaction was predicted by certain numerical solutions to quantum mechanics equations made in the 1970s .
in may *num* an announcement was made by researchers at the chalmers university of technology , in gothenburg , sweden , of the detection of the dynamical casimir effect .
in their experiment , microwave photons were generated out of the vacuum in a superconducting microwave resonator .
these researchers used a modified squid to change the effective length of the resonator in time , mimicking a mirror moving at the required relativistic velocity .
if confirmed this would be the first experimental verification of the dynamical casimir effect .
a similar analysis can be used to explain hawking radiation that causes the slow " evaporation " of black holes ( although this is generally visualized as the escape of one particle from a virtual particle-antiparticle pair , the other particle having been captured by the black hole ) .
constructed within the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime , the dynamical casimir effect has been used to better understand acceleration radiation such as the unruh effect .
there are few instances wherein the casimir effect can give rise to repulsive forces between uncharged objects .
evgeny lifshitz showed ( theoretically ) that in certain circumstances ( most commonly involving liquids ) , repulsive forces can arise .
this has sparked interest in applications of the casimir effect toward the development of levitating devices .
an experimental demonstration of the casimir-based repulsion predicted by lifshitz was carried out by munday et al .
other scientists have also suggested the use of gain media to achieve a similar levitation effect , though this is controversial because these materials seem to violate fundamental causality constraints and the requirement of thermodynamic equilibrium ( kramers–kronig relations ) .
casimir and casimir-polder repulsion can in fact occur for sufficiently anisotropic electrical bodies ; for a review of the issues involved with repulsion see milton et al .
it has been suggested that the casimir forces have application in nanotechnology , in particular silicon integrated circuit technology based micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems , and so-called casimir oscillators .
the casimir effect shows that quantum field theory allows the energy density in certain regions of space to be negative relative to the ordinary vacuum energy , and it has been shown theoretically that quantum field theory allows states where the energy can be " arbitrarily " negative at a given point .
many physicists such as stephen hawking , kip thorne , and others therefore argue that such effects might make it possible to stabilize a traversable wormhole .
on *num* june *num* it was reported that a conglomerate of scientists from hong kong university of science and technology , university of florida , harvard university , massachusetts institute of technology , and oak ridge national laboratory have for the first time demonstrated a compact integrated silicon chip that can measure the casimir force .

existentialism existentialism ( ) is a tradition of philosophical inquiry associated mainly with certain *ord* and 20th-century european philosophers who , despite profound doctrinal differences , shared the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the human subject—not merely the thinking subject , but the acting , feeling , living human individual .
while the predominant value of existentialist thought is commonly acknowledged to be freedom , its primary virtue is authenticity .
in the view of the existentialist , the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called " the existential attitude " , or a sense of disorientation , confusion , or dread in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world .
many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophies , in both style and content , as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience .
søren kierkegaard is generally considered to have been the first existentialist philosopher , though he did not use the term existentialism .
he proposed that each individual—not society or religion—is solely responsible for giving meaning to life and living it passionately and sincerely , or " authentically " .
existentialism became popular in the years following world war ii , and strongly influenced many disciplines besides philosophy , including theology , drama , art , literature , and psychology .
the term " existentialism " ( french : " l'existentialisme " ) was coined by the french catholic philosopher gabriel marcel in the mid-1940s .
at first , when marcel applied the term to him at a colloquium in *num* , jean-paul sartre rejected it .
sartre subsequently changed his mind and , on october *num* , *num* , publicly adopted the existentialist label in a lecture to the " club maintenant " in paris .
the lecture was published as " l'existentialisme est un humanisme " ( " existentialism is a humanism " ) , a short book that did much to popularize existentialist thought .
marcel later came to reject the label himself in favour of the term neo-socratic , in honor of kierkegaard's essay " on the concept of irony " .
some scholars argue that the term should be used only to refer to the cultural movement in europe in the 1940s and 1950s associated with the works of the philosophers jean-paul sartre , simone de beauvoir , maurice merleau-ponty , and albert camus .
other scholars extend the term to kierkegaard , and yet others extend it as far back as socrates .
however , the term is often identified with the philosophical views of jean-paul sartre .
the labels " existentialism " and " existentialist " are often seen as historical conveniences in as far as they were first applied to many philosophers in hindsight , long after they had died .
in fact , while existentialism is generally considered to have originated with kierkegaard , the first prominent existentialist philosopher to adopt the term as a self-description was jean-paul sartre .
sartre posits the idea that " what all existentialists have in common is the fundamental doctrine that existence precedes essence " , as scholar frederick copleston explains .
according to philosopher steven crowell , defining existentialism has been relatively difficult , and he argues that it is better understood as a general approach used to reject certain systematic philosophies rather than as a systematic philosophy itself .
sartre himself , in a lecture delivered in *num* , described existentialism as " the attempt to draw all the consequences from a position of consistent atheism " .
although many outside scandinavia consider the term existentialism to have originated from kierkegaard himself , it is more likely that kierkegaard adopted this term ( or at least the term " existential " as a description of his philosophy ) from the norwegian poet and literary critic johan sebastian cammermeyer welhaven .
this assertion comes from two sources .
the norwegian philosopher erik lundestad refers to the danish philosopher fredrik christian sibbern .
sibbern is supposed to have had two conversations in *num* , the first with welhaven and the second with kierkegaard .
it is in the first conversation that it is believed that welhaven came up with " a word that he said covered a certain thinking , which had a close and positive attitude to life , a relationship he described as existential " .
this was then brought to kierkegaard by sibbern .
the second claim comes from the norwegian historian rune slagstad , who claims to prove that kierkegaard himself said the term " existential " was borrowed from the poet .
he strongly believes that it was kierkegaard himself who said that " hegelians do not study philosophy ' existentially ' ; to use a phrase by welhaven from one time when i spoke with him about philosophy " .
sartre claimed that a central proposition of existentialism is that " existence precedes essence " , which means that the most important consideration for individuals is that they are individuals—independently acting and responsible , conscious beings ( " existence " ) —rather than what labels , roles , stereotypes , definitions , or other preconceived categories the individuals fit ( " essence " ) .
the actual life of the individuals is what constitutes what could be called their " true essence " instead of there being an arbitrarily attributed essence others use to define them .
thus , human beings , through their own consciousness , create their own values and determine a meaning to their life .
although it was sartre who explicitly coined the phrase , similar notions can be found in the thought of existentialist philosophers such as heidegger , and kierkegaard : some interpret the imperative to define oneself as meaning that anyone can wish to be anything .
however , an existentialist philosopher would say such a wish constitutes an inauthentic existence - what sartre would call ' bad faith ' .
instead , the phrase should be taken to say that people are ( *num* ) defined only insofar as they act and ( *num* ) that they are responsible for their actions .
for example , someone who acts cruelly towards other people is , by that act , defined as a cruel person .
furthermore , by this action of cruelty , such persons are themselves responsible for their new identity ( cruel persons ) .
this is as opposed to their genes , or " human nature " , bearing the blame .
as sartre says in his lecture " existentialism is a humanism " : " .
.
.
man first of all exists , encounters himself , surges up in the world—and defines himself afterwards " .
the more positive , therapeutic aspect of this is also implied : a person can choose to act in a different way , and to be a good person instead of a cruel person .
sartre's definition of existentialism was based on heidegger's magnum opus " being and time " .
in the correspondence with jean beaufret later published as the " letter on humanism " , heidegger implies that sartre misunderstood him for his own purposes of subjectivism , and that he did not mean that actions take precedence over being so long as those actions were not reflected upon .
heidegger commented that " the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement " , meaning that he thought sartre had simply switched the roles traditionally attributed to essence and existence without interrogating these concepts and their history in the way that heidegger claimed to have done .
the notion of the absurd contains the idea that there is no meaning in the world beyond what meaning we give it .
this meaninglessness also encompasses the amorality or " unfairness " of the world .
this conceptualization can be highlighted in the way it opposes the traditional judeo-christian-islamic perspective , which establishes that life's purpose is about the fulfillment of god's commandments .
such a purpose is what gives meaning to people's lives .
to live the life of the absurd means rejecting a life that finds or pursues specific meaning for man's existence since there is nothing to be discovered .
according to albert camus , the world or the human being is not in itself absurd .
the concept only emerges through the juxtaposition of the two , where life becomes absurd due to the incompatibility between human beings and the world they inhabit .
this view constitutes one of the two interpretations of the absurd in existentialist literature .
the second view , which was first elaborated by søren kierkegaard , holds that absurdity is limited to actions and choices of human beings .
these are considered absurd since they issue from human freedom , undermining their foundation outside of themselves .
the notion of the absurd in existentialism contrasts with the claim that " bad things don't happen to good people " ; to the world , metaphorically speaking , there is no such thing as a good person or a bad person ; what happens happens , and it may just as well happen to a " good " person as to a " bad " person .
because of the world's absurdity , at any point in time , anything can happen to anyone , and a tragic event could plummet someone into direct confrontation with the absurd .
the notion of the absurd has been prominent in literature throughout history .
many of the literary works of søren kierkegaard , samuel beckett , franz kafka , fyodor dostoyevsky , eugène ionesco , miguel de unamuno , luigi pirandello , jean-paul sartre , joseph heller and albert camus contain descriptions of people who encounter the absurdity of the world .
it is in relation to the concept of the devastating awareness of meaninglessness that albert camus claimed that " there is only one truly serious philosophical problem , and that is suicide " in his " the myth of sisyphus " .
although " prescriptions " against the possibly deleterious consequences of these kinds of encounters vary , from kierkegaard's religious " stage " to camus ' insistence on persevering in spite of absurdity , the concern with helping people avoid living their lives in ways that put them in the perpetual danger of having everything meaningful break down is common to most existentialist philosophers .
the possibility of having everything meaningful break down poses a threat of quietism , which is inherently against the existentialist philosophy .
it has been said that the possibility of suicide makes all humans existentialists .
the ultimate hero of absurdism lives without meaning and faces suicide without succumbing to it .
facticity is a concept defined by sartre in " being and nothingness " as the " in-itself " , which delineates for humans the modalities of being and not being .
this can be more easily understood when considering facticity in relation to the temporal dimension of our past : one's past is what one is , in the sense that it co-constitutes oneself .
however , to say that one is only one's past would be to ignore a significant part of reality ( the present and the future ) , while saying that one's past is only what one was , would entirely detach it from oneself now .
a denial of one's own concrete past constitutes an inauthentic lifestyle , and the same goes for all other kinds of facticity ( having a human body — e .
g .
, one that doesn't allow a person to run faster than the speed of sound — identity , values , etc .
) .
facticity is both a limitation and a condition of freedom .
it is a limitation in that a large part of one's facticity consists of things one couldn't have chosen ( birthplace , etc .
) , but a condition of freedom in the sense that one's values most likely depend on it .
however , even though one's facticity is " set in stone " ( as being past , for instance ) , it cannot determine a person : the value ascribed to one's facticity is still ascribed to it freely by that person .
as an example , consider two men , one of whom has no memory of his past and the other who remembers everything .
they both have committed many crimes , but the first man , knowing nothing about this , leads a rather normal life while the second man , feeling trapped by his own past , continues a life of crime , blaming his own past for " trapping " him in this life .
there is nothing essential about his committing crimes , but he ascribes this meaning to his past .
however , to disregard one's facticity when , in the continual process of self-making , one projects oneself into the future , that would be to put oneself in denial of oneself , and thus would be inauthentic .
in other words , the origin of one's projection must still be one's facticity , though in the mode of not being it ( essentially ) .
an example of one focusing solely on one's possible projects without reflecting on one's current facticity : if one continually thinks about future possibilities related to being rich ( e .
g .
a better car , bigger house , better quality of life , etc .
) without considering the facticity of " not currently having the financial means to do so " .
in this example , considering both facticity and transcendence , an authentic mode of being would be considering future projects that might improve one's current finances ( e .
g .
putting in extra hours , or investing savings ) in order to arrive at a " future-facticity " of a modest pay rise , further leading to purchase of an affordable car .
another aspect of facticity is that it entails angst , both in the sense that freedom " produces " angst when limited by facticity , and in the sense that the lack of the possibility of having facticity to " step in " for one to take responsibility for something one has done , also produces angst .
another aspect of existential freedom is that one can change one's values .
thus , one is responsible for one's values , regardless of society's values .
the focus on freedom in existentialism is related to the limits of the responsibility one bears , as a result of one's freedom : the relationship between freedom and responsibility is one of interdependency , and a clarification of freedom also clarifies that for which one is responsible .
many noted existentialist writers consider the theme of authentic existence important .
authentic existence involves the idea that one has to " create oneself " and then live in accordance with this self .
what is meant by authenticity is that in acting , one should act as oneself , not as " one's acts " or as " one's genes " or any other essence requires .
the authentic act is one that is in accordance with one's freedom .
as a condition of freedom is facticity , this includes one's facticity , but not to the degree that this facticity can in any way determine one's transcendent choices ( in the sense that one could then blame one's background [ facticity ] for making the choice one made [ chosen project , from one's transcendence ] ) .
the role of facticity in relation to authenticity involves letting one's actual values come into play when one makes a choice ( instead of , like kierkegaard's aesthete , " choosing " randomly ) , so that one also takes responsibility for the act instead of choosing either-or without allowing the options to have different values .
in contrast to this , the inauthentic is the denial to live in accordance with one's freedom .
this can take many forms , from pretending choices are meaningless or random , through convincing oneself that some form of determinism is true , to a sort of " mimicry " where one acts as " one should " .
how " one should " act is often determined by an image one has , of how one such as oneself ( say , a bank manager , lion tamer , prostitute , etc .
) acts .
in being and nothingness , sartre relates an example of a " waiter " in " bad faith " : he merely takes part in the " act " of being a typical waiter , albeit very convincingly .
this image usually corresponds to some sort of social norm , but this does not mean that all acting in accordance with social norms is inauthentic : the main point is the attitude one takes to one's own freedom and responsibility , and the extent to which one acts in accordance with this freedom .
the other ( when written with a capital " o " ) is a concept more properly belonging to phenomenology and its account of intersubjectivity .
however , the concept has seen widespread use in existentialist writings , and the conclusions drawn from it differ slightly from the phenomenological accounts .
the experience of the other is the experience of another free subject who inhabits the same world as a person does .
in its most basic form , it is this experience of the other that constitutes intersubjectivity and objectivity .
to clarify , when one experiences someone else , and this other person experiences the world ( the same world that a person experiences ) —only from " over there"—the world itself is constituted as objective in that it is something that is " there " as identical for both of the subjects ; a person experiences the other person as experiencing the same things .
this experience of the other's look is what is termed the look ( sometimes the gaze ) .
while this experience , in its basic phenomenological sense , constitutes the world as objective , and oneself as objectively existing subjectivity ( one experiences oneself as seen in the other's look in precisely the same way that one experiences the other as seen by him , as subjectivity ) , in existentialism , it also acts as a kind of limitation of freedom .
this is because the look tends to objectify what it sees .
as such , when one experiences oneself in the look , one doesn't experience oneself as nothing ( no thing ) , but as something .
sartre's own example of a man peeping at someone through a keyhole can help clarify this : at first , this man is entirely caught up in the situation he is in ; he is in a pre-reflexive state where his entire consciousness is directed at what goes on in the room .
suddenly , he hears a creaking floorboard behind him , and he becomes aware of himself as seen by the other .
he is thus filled with shame for he perceives himself as he would perceive someone else doing what he was doing , as a peeping tom .
for sartre , this phenomenological experience of shame establishes a proof for the existence of other minds and defeats the problem of solipsism .
for the conscious state of shame to be experienced , one has to become aware of oneself as an object of another look , proving a priori , that other minds exist .
the look is then co-constitutive of one's facticity .
another characteristic feature of the look is that no other really needs to have been there : it is quite possible that the creaking floorboard was nothing but the movement of an old house ; the look isn't some kind of mystical telepathic experience of the actual way the other sees one ( there may also have been someone there , but he could have not noticed that the person was there ) .
it is only one's perception of the way another might perceive him .
"existential angst " , sometimes called existential dread , anxiety , or anguish , is a term that is common to many existentialist thinkers .
it is generally held to be a negative feeling arising from the experience of human freedom and responsibility .
the archetypical example is the experience one has when standing on a cliff where one not only fears falling off it , but also dreads the possibility of throwing oneself off .
in this experience that " nothing is holding me back " , one senses the lack of anything that predetermines one to either throw oneself off or to stand still , and one experiences one's own freedom .
angst , according to the modern existentialist , adam fong , is the sudden realization of a lack of meaning , often while one completes a task that initially seems to have intrinsic meaning .
it can also be seen in relation to the previous point how angst is before nothing , and this is what sets it apart from fear that has an object .
while in the case of fear , one can take definitive measures to remove the object of fear , in the case of angst , no such " constructive " measures are possible .
the use of the word " nothing " in this context relates both to the inherent insecurity about the consequences of one's actions , and to the fact that , in experiencing freedom as angst , one also realizes that one is fully responsible for these consequences .
there is nothing in people ( genetically , for instance ) that acts in their stead—that they can blame if something goes wrong .
therefore , not every choice is perceived as having dreadful possible consequences ( and , it can be claimed , human lives would be unbearable if every choice facilitated dread ) .
however , this doesn't change the fact that freedom remains a condition of every action .
despair , in existentialism , is generally defined as a loss of hope .
more specifically , it is a loss of hope in reaction to a breakdown in one or more of the defining qualities of one's self or identity .
if a person is invested in being a particular thing , such as a bus driver or an upstanding citizen , and then finds their being-thing compromised , they would normally be found in a state of despair—a hopeless state .
for example , a singer who loses the ability to sing may despair if they have nothing else to fall back on—nothing to rely on for their identity .
they find themselves unable to be what defined their being .
what sets the existentialist notion of despair apart from the conventional definition is that existentialist despair is a state one is in even when they aren't overtly in despair .
so long as a person's identity depends on qualities that can crumble , they are in perpetual despair—and as there is , in sartrean terms , no human essence found in conventional reality on which to constitute the individual's sense of identity , despair is a universal human condition .
as kierkegaard defines it in " either / or " : " let each one learn what he can ; both of us can learn that a person’s unhappiness never lies in his lack of control over external conditions , since this would only make him completely unhappy .
" in " works of love " , he said : existentialists oppose definitions of human beings as primarily rational , and , therefore , oppose positivism and rationalism .
existentialism asserts that people actually make decisions based on subjective meaning rather than pure rationality .
the rejection of reason as the source of meaning is a common theme of existentialist thought , as is the focus on the feelings of anxiety and dread that we feel in the face of our own radical freedom and our awareness of death .
kierkegaard advocated rationality as a means to interact with the objective world ( e .
g .
, in the natural sciences ) , but when it comes to existential problems , reason is insufficient : " human reason has boundaries " .
like kierkegaard , sartre saw problems with rationality , calling it a form of " bad faith " , an attempt by the self to impose structure on a world of phenomena—"the other"—that is fundamentally irrational and random .
according to sartre , rationality and other forms of bad faith hinder people from finding meaning in freedom .
to try to suppress their feelings of anxiety and dread , people confine themselves within everyday experience , sartre asserts , thereby relinquishing their freedom and acquiescing to being possessed in one form or another by " the look " of " the other " ( i .
e .
, possessed by another person—or at least one's idea of that other person ) .
an existentialist reading of the bible would demand that the reader recognize that ( s ) he is an existing subject studying the words more as a recollection of events .
this is in contrast to looking at a collection of " truths " that are outside and unrelated to the reader , but may develop a sense of reality / god .
such a reader is not obligated to follow the commandments as if an external agent is forcing these commandments upon them , but as though they are inside them and guiding them from inside .
this is the task kierkegaard takes up when he asks : " who has the more difficult task : the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life - or the learner who should put it to use ? " although nihilism and existentialism are distinct philosophies , they are often confused with one another as both are rooted in the human experience of anguish and confusion stemming from the apparent meaninglessness of a world in which humans are compelled to find or create meaning .
a primary cause of confusion is that friedrich nietzsche is an important philosopher in both fields .
existentialist philosophers often stress the importance of angst as signifying the absolute lack of any objective ground for action , a move that is often reduced to a moral or an existential nihilism .
a pervasive theme in the works of existentialist philosophy , however , is to persist through encounters with the absurd , as seen in camus ' " the myth of sisyphus " ( " one must imagine sisyphus happy " ) , and it is only very rarely that existentialist philosophers dismiss morality or one's self-created meaning : kierkegaard regained a sort of morality in the religious ( although he wouldn't himself agree that it was ethical ; the religious suspends the ethical ) , and sartre's final words in " being and nothingness " are " all these questions , which refer us to a pure and not an accessory ( or impure ) reflection , can find their reply only on the ethical plane .
we shall devote to them a future work .
" søren kierkegaard and friedrich nietzsche were two of the first philosophers considered fundamental to the existentialist movement , though neither used the term " existentialism " and it is unclear whether they would have supported the existentialism of the *ord* century .
they focused on subjective human experience rather than the objective truths of mathematics and science , which they believed were too detached or observational to truly get at the human experience .
like pascal , they were interested in people's quiet struggle with the apparent meaninglessness of life and the use of diversion to escape from boredom .
unlike pascal , kierkegaard and nietzsche also considered the role of making free choices , particularly regarding fundamental values and beliefs , and how such choices change the nature and identity of the chooser .
kierkegaard's knight of faith and nietzsche's übermensch are representative of people who exhibit freedom , in that they define the nature of their own existence .
nietzsche's idealized individual invents his own values and creates the very terms they excel under .
by contrast , kierkegaard , opposed to the level of abstraction in hegel , and not nearly as hostile ( actually welcoming ) to christianity as nietzsche , argues through a pseudonym that the objective certainty of religious truths ( specifically christian ) is not only impossible , but even founded on logical paradoxes .
yet he continues to imply that a leap of faith is a possible means for an individual to reach a higher stage of existence that transcends and contains both an aesthetic and ethical value of life .
kierkegaard and nietzsche were also precursors to other intellectual movements , including postmodernism , and various strands of psychotherapy .
however , kierkegaard believed that individuals should live in accordance with their thinking .
the first important literary author also important to existentialism was the russian fyodor dostoyevsky .
dostoyevsky's " notes from underground " portrays a man unable to fit into society and unhappy with the identities he creates for himself .
jean-paul sartre , in his book on existentialism " existentialism is a humanism " , quoted dostoyevsky's " the brothers karamazov " as an example of existential crisis .
sartre attributes ivan karamazov's claim , " if god did not exist , everything would be permitted " to dostoyevsky himself , though this quote does not appear in the novel .
however , a similar sentiment is explicitly stated when alyosha visits dimitri in prison .
dimitri mentions his conversations with rakitin in which the idea that " then , if he doesn't exist , man is king of the earth , of the universe " allowing the inference contained in sartre's attribution to remain a valid idea contested within the novel .
other dostoyevsky novels covered issues raised in existentialist philosophy while presenting story lines divergent from secular existentialism : for example , in " crime and punishment " , the protagonist raskolnikov experiences an existential crisis and then moves toward a christian orthodox worldview similar to that advocated by dostoyevsky himself .
in the first decades of the *ord* century , a number of philosophers and writers explored existentialist ideas .
the spanish philosopher miguel de unamuno y jugo , in his *num* book " the tragic sense of life in men and nations " , emphasized the life of " flesh and bone " as opposed to that of abstract rationalism .
unamuno rejected systematic philosophy in favor of the individual's quest for faith .
he retained a sense of the tragic , even absurd nature of the quest , symbolized by his enduring interest in cervantes ' fictional character don quixote .
a novelist , poet and dramatist as well as philosophy professor at the university of salamanca , unamuno wrote a short story about a priest's crisis of faith , " saint manuel the good , martyr " , which has been collected in anthologies of existentialist fiction .
another spanish thinker , ortega y gasset , writing in *num* , held that human existence must always be defined as the individual person combined with the concrete circumstances of his life : " "yo soy yo y mi circunstancia" " ( " i am myself and my circumstances " ) .
sartre likewise believed that human existence is not an abstract matter , but is always situated ( " "en situation" " ) .
although martin buber wrote his major philosophical works in german , and studied and taught at the universities of berlin and frankfurt , he stands apart from the mainstream of german philosophy .
born into a jewish family in vienna in *num* , he was also a scholar of jewish culture and involved at various times in zionism and hasidism .
in *num* , he moved permanently to jerusalem .
his best-known philosophical work was the short book " i and thou " , published in *num* .
for buber , the fundamental fact of human existence , too readily overlooked by scientific rationalism and abstract philosophical thought , is " man with man " , a dialogue that takes place in the so-called " sphere of between " ( " "das zwischenmenschliche" " ) .
two russian thinkers , lev shestov and nikolai berdyaev , became well known as existentialist thinkers during their post-revolutionary exiles in paris .
shestov , born into a ukrainian-jewish family in kiev , had launched an attack on rationalism and systematization in philosophy as early as *num* in his book of aphorisms " all things are possible " .
berdyaev , also from kiev but with a background in the eastern orthodox church , drew a radical distinction between the world of spirit and the everyday world of objects .
human freedom , for berdyaev , is rooted in the realm of spirit , a realm independent of scientific notions of causation .
to the extent the individual human being lives in the objective world , he is estranged from authentic spiritual freedom .
" man " is not to be interpreted naturalistically , but as a being created in god's image , an originator of free , creative acts .
he published a major work on these themes , " the destiny of man " , in *num* .
gabriel marcel , long before coining the term " existentialism " , introduced important existentialist themes to a french audience in his early essay " existence and objectivity " ( *num* ) and in his " metaphysical journal " ( *num* ) .
a dramatist as well as a philosopher , marcel found his philosophical starting point in a condition of metaphysical alienation : the human individual searching for harmony in a transient life .
harmony , for marcel , was to be sought through " secondary reflection " , a " dialogical " rather than " dialectical " approach to the world , characterized by " wonder and astonishment " and open to the " presence " of other people and of god rather than merely to " information " about them .
for marcel , such presence implied more than simply being there ( as one thing might be in the presence of another thing ) ; it connoted " extravagant " availability , and the willingness to put oneself at the disposal of the other .
marcel contrasted " secondary reflection " with abstract , scientific-technical " primary reflection " , which he associated with the activity of the abstract cartesian ego .
for marcel , philosophy was a concrete activity undertaken by a sensing , feeling human being incarnate—embodied—in a concrete world .
although jean-paul sartre adopted the term " existentialism " for his own philosophy in the 1940s , marcel's thought has been described as " almost diametrically opposed " to that of sartre .
unlike sartre , marcel was a christian , and became a catholic convert in *num* .
in germany , the psychologist and philosopher karl jaspers—who later described existentialism as a " phantom " created by the public—called his own thought , heavily influenced by kierkegaard and nietzsche , " existenzphilosophie " .
for jaspers , " "existenz"-philosophy is the way of thought by means of which man seeks to become himself .
.
.
this way of thought does not cognize objects , but elucidates and makes actual the being of the thinker " .
jaspers , a professor at the university of heidelberg , was acquainted with martin heidegger , who held a professorship at marburg before acceding to husserl's chair at freiburg in *num* .
they held many philosophical discussions , but later became estranged over heidegger's support of national socialism ( nazism ) .
they shared an admiration for kierkegaard , and in the 1930s , heidegger lectured extensively on nietzsche .
nevertheless , the extent to which heidegger should be considered an existentialist is debatable .
in " being and time " he presented a method of rooting philosophical explanations in human existence ( " dasein " ) to be analysed in terms of existential categories ( " existentiale " ) ; and this has led many commentators to treat him as an important figure in the existentialist movement .
following the second world war , existentialism became a well-known and significant philosophical and cultural movement , mainly through the public prominence of two french writers , jean-paul sartre and albert camus , who wrote best-selling novels , plays and widely read journalism as well as theoretical texts .
these years also saw the growing reputation of heidegger's book " being and time " outside germany .
sartre dealt with existentialist themes in his *num* novel " nausea " and the short stories in his *num* collection " the wall " , and had published his treatise on existentialism , " being and nothingness " , in *num* , but it was in the two years following the liberation of paris from the german occupying forces that he and his close associates—camus , simone de beauvoir , maurice merleau-ponty , and others—became internationally famous as the leading figures of a movement known as existentialism .
in a very short period of time , camus and sartre in particular became the leading public intellectuals of post-war france , achieving by the end of *num* " a fame that reached across all audiences .
" camus was an editor of the most popular leftist ( former french resistance ) newspaper " combat " ; sartre launched his journal of leftist thought , " les temps modernes " , and two weeks later gave the widely reported lecture on existentialism and secular humanism to a packed meeting of the club maintenant .
beauvoir wrote that " not a week passed without the newspapers discussing us " ; existentialism became " the first media craze of the postwar era .
" by the end of *num* , camus ' earlier fiction and plays had been reprinted , his new play " caligula " had been performed and his novel " the plague " published ; the first two novels of sartre's " the roads to freedom " trilogy had appeared , as had beauvoir's novel " the blood of others " .
works by camus and sartre were already appearing in foreign editions .
the paris-based existentialists had become famous .
sartre had traveled to germany in *num* to study the phenomenology of edmund husserl and martin heidegger , and he included critical comments on their work in his major treatise " being and nothingness " .
heidegger's thought had also become known in french philosophical circles through its use by alexandre kojève in explicating hegel in a series of lectures given in paris in the 1930s .
the lectures were highly influential ; members of the audience included not only sartre and merleau-ponty , but raymond queneau , georges bataille , louis althusser , andré breton , and jacques lacan .
a selection from heidegger's " being and time " was published in french in *num* , and his essays began to appear in french philosophy journals .
heidegger read sartre's work and was initially impressed , commenting : " here for the first time i encountered an independent thinker who , from the foundations up , has experienced the area out of which i think .
your work shows such an immediate comprehension of my philosophy as i have never before encountered .
" later , however , in response to a question posed by his french follower jean beaufret , heidegger distanced himself from sartre's position and existentialism in general in his " letter on humanism " .
heidegger's reputation continued to grow in france during the 1950s and 1960s .
in the 1960s , sartre attempted to reconcile existentialism and marxism in his work " critique of dialectical reason " .
a major theme throughout his writings was freedom and responsibility .
camus was a friend of sartre , until their falling-out , and wrote several works with existential themes including " the rebel " , " summer in algiers " , " the myth of sisyphus " , and " the stranger " , the latter being " considered—to what would have been camus's irritation—the exemplary existentialist novel .
" camus , like many others , rejected the existentialist label , and considered his works concerned with facing the absurd .
in the titular book , camus uses the analogy of the greek myth of sisyphus to demonstrate the futility of existence .
in the myth , sisyphus is condemned for eternity to roll a rock up a hill , but when he reaches the summit , the rock will roll to the bottom again .
camus believes that this existence is pointless but that sisyphus ultimately finds meaning and purpose in his task , simply by continually applying himself to it .
the first half of the book contains an extended rebuttal of what camus took to be existentialist philosophy in the works of kierkegaard , shestov , heidegger , and jaspers .
simone de beauvoir , an important existentialist who spent much of her life as sartre's partner , wrote about feminist and existentialist ethics in her works , including " the second sex " and " the ethics of ambiguity " .
although often overlooked due to her relationship with sartre , de beauvoir integrated existentialism with other forms of thinking such as feminism , unheard of at the time , resulting in alienation from fellow writers such as camus .
paul tillich , an important existentialist theologian following kierkegaard and karl barth , applied existentialist concepts to christian theology , and helped introduce existential theology to the general public .
his seminal work " the courage to be " follows kierkegaard's analysis of anxiety and life's absurdity , but puts forward the thesis that modern humans must , via god , achieve selfhood in spite of life's absurdity .
rudolf bultmann used kierkegaard's and heidegger's philosophy of existence to demythologize christianity by interpreting christian mythical concepts into existentialist concepts .
maurice merleau-ponty , an existential phenomenologist , was for a time a companion of sartre .
merleau-ponty's " phenomenology of perception " ( *num* ) was recognized as a major statement of french existentialism .
it has been said that merleau-ponty's work " humanism and terror " greatly influenced sartre .
however , in later years they were to disagree irreparably , dividing many existentialists such as de beauvoir , who sided with sartre .
colin wilson , an english writer , published his study " the outsider " in *num* , initially to critical acclaim .
in this book and others ( e .
g .
" introduction to the new existentialism " ) , he attempted to reinvigorate what he perceived as a pessimistic philosophy and bring it to a wider audience .
he was not , however , academically trained , and his work was attacked by professional philosophers for lack of rigor and critical standards .
stanley kubrick's *num* anti-war film " paths of glory " " illustrates , and even illuminates .
.
.
existentialism " by examining the " necessary absurdity of the human condition " and the " horror of war " .
the film tells the story of a fictional world war i french army regiment ordered to attack an impregnable german stronghold ; when the attack fails , three soldiers are chosen at random , court-martialed by a " kangaroo court " , and executed by firing squad .
the film examines existentialist ethics , such as the issue of whether objectivity is possible and the " problem of authenticity " .
orson welles ' *num* film " the trial " , based upon franz kafka's book of the same name ( der process ) , is characteristic of both existentialist and absurdist themes in its depiction of a man ( joseph k .
) arrested for a crime for which the charges are neither revealed to him nor to the reader .
"neon genesis evangelion " is a japanese science fiction animation series created by the anime studio gainax and was both directed and written by hideaki anno .
existential themes of individuality , consciousness , freedom , choice , and responsibility are heavily relied upon throughout the entire series , particularly through the philosophies of jean-paul sartre and søren kierkegaard .
episode 16's title , is a reference to kierkegaard's book , " the sickness unto death " .
some contemporary films dealing with existentialist issues include " melancholia " , " fight club " , " i heart huckabees " , " waking life " , " the matrix " , " ordinary people " , and " life in a day " .
likewise , films throughout the *ord* century such as " the seventh seal " , " ikiru " , " taxi driver " , the " toy story " films , " the great silence " , " ghost in the shell " , " harold and maude " , " high noon " , " easy rider " , " one flew over the cuckoo's nest " , " a clockwork orange " , " groundhog day " , " apocalypse now " , " badlands " , and " blade runner " also have existentialist qualities .
notable directors known for their existentialist films include ingmar bergman , françois truffaut , jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni , akira kurosawa , terrence malick , stanley kubrick , andrei tarkovsky , hideaki anno , wes anderson , gaspar noé , woody allen , and christopher nolan .
charlie kaufman's " synecdoche , new york " focuses on the protagonist's desire to find existential meaning .
similarly , in kurosawa's " red beard " , the protagonist's experiences as an intern in a rural health clinic in japan lead him to an existential crisis whereby he questions his reason for being .
this , in turn , leads him to a better understanding of humanity .
the french film , " mood indigo " ( directed by michel gondry ) embraced various elements of existentialism .
the film " the shawshank redemption " , released in *num* , depicts life in a prison in maine , united states to explore several existentialist concepts .
existential perspectives are also found in modern literature to varying degrees , especially since the 1920s .
louis-ferdinand céline's " journey to the end of the night " ( voyage au bout de la nuit , *num* ) celebrated by both sartre and beauvoir , contained many of the themes that would be found in later existential literature , and is in some ways , the proto-existential novel .
jean-paul sartre's *num* novel " nausea " was " steeped in existential ideas " , and is considered an accessible way of grasping his philosophical stance .
between *num* and *num* , other authors such as albert camus , franz kafka , rainer maria rilke , t .
s .
eliot , herman hesse , luigi pirandello , ralph ellison , and jack kerouac , composed literature or poetry that contained , to varying degrees , elements of existential or proto-existential thought .
the philosophy's influence even reached pulp literature shortly after the turn of the *ord* century , as seen in the existential disparity witnessed in man's lack of control of his fate in the works of h .
p .
lovecraft .
since the late 1960s , a great deal of cultural activity in literature contains postmodernist as well as existential elements .
books such as " do androids dream of electric sheep ? " ( *num* ) ( now republished as " blade runner " ) by philip k .
dick , " slaughterhouse-five " by kurt vonnegut , " fight club " by chuck palahniuk and " formless meanderings " by bharath srinivasan all distort the line between reality and appearance while simultaneously espousing existential themes .
jean-paul sartre wrote " no exit " in *num* , an existentialist play originally published in french as " huis clos " ( meaning " in camera " or " behind closed doors " ) , which is the source of the popular quote , " hell is other people .
" ( in french , " l'enfer , c'est les autres " ) .
the play begins with a valet leading a man into a room that the audience soon realizes is in hell .
eventually he is joined by two women .
after their entry , the valet leaves and the door is shut and locked .
all three expect to be tortured , but no torturer arrives .
instead , they realize they are there to torture each other , which they do effectively by probing each other's sins , desires , and unpleasant memories .
existentialist themes are displayed in the theatre of the absurd , notably in samuel beckett's " waiting for godot " , in which two men divert themselves while they wait expectantly for someone ( or something ) named godot who never arrives .
they claim godot is an acquaintance , but in fact , hardly know him , admitting they would not recognize him if they saw him .
samuel beckett , once asked who or what godot is , replied , " if i knew , i would have said so in the play .
" to occupy themselves , the men eat , sleep , talk , argue , sing , play games , exercise , swap hats , and contemplate suicide—anything " to hold the terrible silence at bay " .
the play " exploits several archetypal forms and situations , all of which lend themselves to both comedy and pathos .
" the play also illustrates an attitude toward human experience on earth : the poignancy , oppression , camaraderie , hope , corruption , and bewilderment of human experience that can be reconciled only in the mind and art of the absurdist .
the play examines questions such as death , the meaning of human existence and the place of god in human existence .
tom stoppard's " rosencrantz & guildenstern are dead " is an absurdist tragicomedy first staged at the edinburgh festival fringe in *num* .
the play expands upon the exploits of two minor characters from shakespeare's " hamlet " .
comparisons have also been drawn to samuel beckett's " waiting for godot " , for the presence of two central characters who appear almost as two halves of a single character .
many plot features are similar as well : the characters pass time by playing questions , impersonating other characters , and interrupting each other or remaining silent for long periods of time .
the two characters are portrayed as two clowns or fools in a world beyond their understanding .
they stumble through philosophical arguments while not realizing the implications , and muse on the irrationality and randomness of the world .
jean anouilh's " antigone " also presents arguments founded on existentialist ideas .
it is a tragedy inspired by greek mythology and the play of the same name ( antigone , by sophocles ) from the *ord* century bc .
in english , it is often distinguished from its antecedent by being pronounced in its original french form , approximately " ante-gōn .
" the play was first performed in paris on *num* february *num* , during the nazi occupation of france .
produced under nazi censorship , the play is purposefully ambiguous with regards to the rejection of authority ( represented by antigone ) and the acceptance of it ( represented by creon ) .
the parallels to the french resistance and the nazi occupation have been drawn .
antigone rejects life as desperately meaningless but without affirmatively choosing a noble death .
the crux of the play is the lengthy dialogue concerning the nature of power , fate , and choice , during which antigone says that she is , " .
.
.
disgusted with [ the ] .
.
.
promise of a humdrum happiness .
" she states that she would rather die than live a mediocre existence .
critic martin esslin in his book " theatre of the absurd " pointed out how many contemporary playwrights such as samuel beckett , eugène ionesco , jean genet , and arthur adamov wove into their plays the existentialist belief that we are absurd beings loose in a universe empty of real meaning .
esslin noted that many of these playwrights demonstrated the philosophy better than did the plays by sartre and camus .
though most of such playwrights , subsequently labeled " absurdist " ( based on esslin's book ) , denied affiliations with existentialism and were often staunchly anti-philosophical ( for example ionesco often claimed he identified more with ' pataphysics or with surrealism than with existentialism ) , the playwrights are often linked to existentialism based on esslin's observation .
a major offshoot of existentialism as a philosophy is existentialist psychology and psychoanalysis , which first crystallized in the work of otto rank , freud's closest associate for *num* years .
without awareness of the writings of rank , ludwig binswanger was influenced by freud , edmund husserl , heidegger , and sartre .
a later figure was viktor frankl , who briefly met freud as a young man .
his logotherapy can be regarded as a form of existentialist therapy .
the existentialists would also influence social psychology , antipositivist micro-sociology , symbolic interactionism , and post-structuralism , with the work of thinkers such as georg simmel and michel foucault .
foucault was a great reader of kierkegaard even though he almost never refers this author , who nonetheless had for him an importance as secret as it was decisive .
an early contributor to existentialist psychology in the united states was rollo may , who was strongly influenced by kierkegaard and otto rank .
one of the most prolific writers on techniques and theory of existentialist psychology in the usa is irvin d .
yalom .
yalom states that aside from their reaction against freud's mechanistic , deterministic model of the mind and their assumption of a phenomenological approach in therapy , the existentialist analysts have little in common and have never been regarded as a cohesive ideological school .
these thinkers—who include ludwig binswanger , medard boss , eugène minkowski , v .
e .
gebsattel , roland kuhn , g .
caruso , f .
t .
buytendijk , g .
bally and victor frankl—were almost entirely unknown to the american psychotherapeutic community until rollo may's highly influential *num* book " existence"—and especially his introductory essay—introduced their work into this country .
a more recent contributor to the development of a european version of existentialist psychotherapy is the british-based emmy van deurzen .
anxiety's importance in existentialism makes it a popular topic in psychotherapy .
therapists often offer existentialist philosophy as an explanation for anxiety .
the assertion is that anxiety is manifested of an individual's complete freedom to decide , and complete responsibility for the outcome of such decisions .
psychotherapists using an existentialist approach believe that a patient can harness his anxiety and use it constructively .
instead of suppressing anxiety , patients are advised to use it as grounds for change .
by embracing anxiety as inevitable , a person can use it to achieve his full potential in life .
humanistic psychology also had major impetus from existentialist psychology and shares many of the fundamental tenets .
terror management theory , based on the writings of ernest becker and otto rank , is a developing area of study within the academic study of psychology .
it looks at what researchers claim are implicit emotional reactions of people confronted with the knowledge that they will eventually die .
also , gerd b .
achenbach has refreshed the socratic tradition with his own blend of philosophical counseling .
so did michel weber with his chromatiques center in belgium .
walter kaufmann criticized ' the profoundly unsound methods and the dangerous contempt for reason that have been so prominent in existentialism .
' logical positivist philosophers , such as rudolf carnap and a .
j .
ayer , assert that existentialists are often confused about the verb " to be " in their analyses of " being " .
specifically , they argue that the verb " is " is transitive and pre-fixed to a predicate ( e .
g .
, an apple " is red " ) ( without a predicate , the word " is " is meaningless ) , and that existentialists frequently misuse the term in this manner .
colin wilson has stated in his book " the angry years " that existentialism has created many of its own difficulties : " we can see how this question of freedom of the will has been vitiated by post-romantic philosophy , with its inbuilt tendency to laziness and boredom , we can also see how it came about that existentialism found itself in a hole of its own digging , and how the philosophical developments since then have amounted to walking in circles round that hole " .
many critics argue jean-paul sartre's philosophy is contradictory .
specifically , they argue that sartre makes metaphysical arguments despite his claiming that his philosophical views ignore metaphysics .
herbert marcuse criticized sartre's *num* " being and nothingness " for projecting anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself : " insofar as existentialism is a philosophical doctrine , it remains an idealistic doctrine : it hypostatizes specific historical conditions of human existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics .
existentialism thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks , and its radicalism is illusory " .
in " letter on humanism " , martin heidegger criticized sartre's existentialism : existentialism says existence precedes essence .
in this statement he is taking " existentia " and " essentia " according to their metaphysical meaning , which , from plato's time on , has said that " essentia " precedes " existentia " .
sartre reverses this statement .
but the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement .
with it , he stays with metaphysics , in oblivion of the truth of being .
captain america captain america ( steven " steve " rogers ) is a fictional superhero appearing in american comic books published by marvel comics .
created by cartoonists joe simon and jack kirby , the character first appeared in " captain america comics " #1 ( cover dated march *num* ) from timely comics , a predecessor of marvel comics .
captain america was designed as a patriotic supersoldier who often fought the axis powers of world war ii and was timely comics ' most popular character during the wartime period .
the popularity of superheroes waned following the war and the " captain america " comic book was discontinued in *num* , with a short-lived revival in *num* .
since marvel comics revived the character in *num* , captain america has remained in publication .
the character wears a costume bearing an american flag motif , and he utilizes a nearly indestructible shield which he throws as a projectile .
captain america is the alter ego of steve rogers , a frail young man enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum to aid the united states government's efforts in world war ii .
near the end of the war , he was trapped in ice and survived in suspended animation until he was revived in the present day .
although captain america often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his time with its modern realities , he remains a highly respected figure in his community which includes becoming the long-time leader of the avengers .
captain america was the first marvel comics character to appear in media outside comics with the release of the *num* movie serial , " captain america " .
since then , the character has been featured in other films and television series .
in the marvel cinematic universe ( mcu ) , the character is portrayed by chris evans in " " , " the avengers " , " " , " " , " ant-man " , " " , " " , " " , and " " .
captain america is ranked sixth on ign's " top *num* comic book heroes of all time " in *num* , second in their list of " the top *num* avengers " in *num* , and second in their " top *num* best marvel superheroes " list in *num* .
in *num* , writer joe simon conceived the idea for captain america and made a sketch of the character in costume .
" i wrote the name ' super american ' at the bottom of the page , " simon said in his autobiography , and then decided : simon recalled in his autobiography that timely comics publisher martin goodman gave him the go-ahead and directed that a captain america solo comic book series be published as soon as possible .
needing to fill a full comic with primarily one character's stories , simon did not believe that his regular creative partner , artist jack kirby , could handle the workload alone : al lieberman would ink that first issue , which was lettered by simon and kirby's regular letterer , howard ferguson .
simon said captain america was a consciously political creation ; he and kirby were morally repulsed by the actions of nazi germany in the years leading up to the united states ' involvement in world war ii and felt war was inevitable : " the opponents to the war were all quite well organized .
we wanted to have our say too .
" captain america comics #1 — cover-dated march *num* and on sale december *num* , *num* , a year before the attack on pearl harbor , but a full year into world war ii — showed the protagonist punching nazi leader adolf hitler ; it sold nearly one million copies .
while most readers responded favorably to the comic , some took objection .
simon noted , " when the first issue came out we got a lot of .
.
.
threatening letters and hate mail .
some people really opposed what cap stood for .
" the threats , which included menacing groups of people loitering out on the street outside of the offices , proved so serious that police protection was posted with new york mayor fiorello la guardia personally contacting simon and kirby to give his support .
though preceded as a " patriotically themed superhero " by mlj's the shield , captain america immediately became the most prominent and enduring of that wave of superheroes introduced in american comic books prior to and during world war ii , as evidenced by the unusual move at the time of premiering the character in his own title instead of an anthology title first .
this popularity drew the attention and a complaint from mlj that the character's triangular shield too closely resembled the chest symbol of their shield character .
in response , goodman had simon and kirby create a distinctive round shield for issue *num* , which went on to become an iconic element of the character .
with his sidekick bucky , captain america faced nazis , japanese , and other threats to wartime america and the allies .
stanley lieber , now better known as stan lee , contributed to the character in issue #3 in the filler text story " captain america foils the traitor's revenge " , which introduced the character's use of his shield as a returning throwing weapon .
captain america soon became timely's most popular character and even had a fan-club called the " sentinels of liberty " .
circulation figures remained close to a million copies per month after the debut issue , which outstripped even the circulation of news magazines such as " time " during the period .
after the simon and kirby team moved to dc comics in late *num* , having produced " captain america comics " through issue #10 ( january *num* ) , al avison and syd shores became regular pencillers of the celebrated title , with one generally inking over the other .
the character was featured in " all winners comics " #1–19 ( summer *num* – fall *num* ) , " marvel mystery comics " #80–84 and #86–92 , " usa comics " #6–17 ( dec .
*num* – fall *num* ) , and " all select comics " #1–10 ( fall *num* – summer *num* ) .
in the post-war era , with the popularity of superheroes fading , captain america led timely's first superhero team , the all-winners squad , in its two published adventures , in " all winners comics " #19 and #21 ( fall–winter *num* ; there was no issue #20 ) .
after bucky was shot and wounded in a *num* " captain america " story , he was succeeded by captain america's girlfriend , betsy ross , who became the superheroine golden girl .
" captain america comics " ran until issue #73 ( july *num* ) , at which time the series was retitled captain america's weird tales for two issues , with the finale being a horror / suspense anthology issue with no superheroes .
atlas comics attempted to revive its superhero titles when it reintroduced captain america , along with the original human torch and the sub-mariner , in " young men " #24 ( dec .
*num* ) .
billed as " captain america , commie smasher ! " captain america appeared during the next year in " young men " #24–28 and " men's adventures " #27–28 , as well as in issues #76–78 of an eponymous title .
atlas ' attempted superhero revival was a commercial failure , and the character's title was canceled with " captain america " #78 ( sept .
*num* ) .
in the human torch story titled " captain america " in marvel comics ' " strange tales " #114 ( nov .
*num* ) , writer-editor stan lee and artist and co-plotter jack kirby depicted the brash young fantastic four member johnny storm , the human torch , in an exhibition performance with captain america , described as a legendary world war ii and 1950s superhero who has returned after many years of apparent retirement .
the 18-page story ends with this captain america revealed as an impostor : it was actually the villain the acrobat , a former circus performer the torch had defeated in " strange tales " #106 , who broke two thieves out of jail , hoping to draw the police away while trying to rob the local bank .
afterward , storm digs out an old comic book in which captain america is shown to be steve rogers .
a caption in the final panel says this story was a test to see if readers would like captain america to return .
according to lee , fan response to the tryout was very enthusiastic .
captain america was then formally reintroduced in " the avengers " #4 ( march *num* ) , which explained that in the final days of world war ii , he had fallen from an experimental drone plane into the north atlantic ocean and spent decades frozen in a block of ice in a state of suspended animation .
the hero found a new generation of readers as leader of that superhero team .
following the success of other marvel characters introduced during the 1960s , captain america was recast as a hero " haunted by past memories , and trying to adapt to 1960s society " .
after then guest-starring in the feature " iron man " in " tales of suspense " #58 ( oct .
*num* ) , captain america gained his own solo feature in that " split book " , beginning the following issue .
issue #63 ( march *num* ) , which retold captain america's origin , through issue #71 ( nov .
*num* ) was a period feature set during world war ii and co-starred captain america's golden age sidekick , bucky .
kirby drew all but two of the stories in " tales of suspense , " which became " captain america " with #100 ( april *num* ) ; gil kane and john romita sr .
, each filled in once .
several stories were finished by penciller-inker george tuska over kirby layouts , with one finished by romita sr .
and another by penciller dick ayers and inker john tartaglione .
kirby's regular inkers on the series were frank giacoia ( as " frank ray " ) and joe sinnott , though don heck and golden age captain america artist syd shores inked one story each .
this series — considered " captain america " volume one by comics researchers and historians , following the 1940s " captain america comics " and its 1950s numbering continuation of " tales of suspense " — ended with #454 ( aug .
*num* ) .
this series was almost immediately followed by the 13-issue " captain america " vol .
*num* ( nov .
*num* – nov .
*num* , part of the " heroes reborn " crossover ) , the 50-issue " captain america " vol .

beginning with the *ord* overall issue ( aug .
*num* ) , " captain america " resumed its original numbering , as if the series numbering had continued uninterrupted after #454 .
as part of the aftermath of marvel comics ' company-crossover storyline " civil war " , steve rogers was ostensibly killed in " captain america " vol .
*num* , #25 ( march *num* ) .
the storyline of rogers ' return began in issue #600 .
rogers , who was not dead but caroming through time , returned to the present day in the six-issue miniseries " " ( sept .
*num* – march *num* ) .
after rogers ' return , barnes , at rogers ' insistence , continued as captain america , beginning in the one-shot comic " captain america : who will wield the shield ? " ( feb .
*num* ) .
while bucky barnes continued adventuring in the pages of " captain america " , steve rogers received his own miniseries ( " steve rogers : super-soldier " ) as well as taking on the leadership position in a new " secret avengers " ongoing series .
spinoff series included " captain america sentinel of liberty " ( sept .
*num* – aug .
*num* ) and " captain america and the falcon " ( may *num* – june *num* ) .
the 1940s captain america appeared alongside the 1940s human torch and sub-mariner in the 12-issue miniseries " avengers / invaders " .
the *num* mini-series " captain america : the chosen " , written by david morrell and penciled by mitchell breitweiser , depicts a dying steve rogers ' final minutes , at s .

d .
headquarters , as his spirit guides james newman , a young american marine fighting in afghanistan .
" the chosen " is not part of the main marvel universe continuity .
during the " two americas " storyline that ran in issues #602-605 , the series drew controversy for the similarity between protesters depicted in the comic and the tea party movement .
particularly drawing scorn was a panel of a protester holding sign that read " tea bag the libs before they tea bag you ! " also drawing controversy were remarks made by the falcon implying that the crowd is racist .
in his column on comic book resources , marvel comics editor-in-chief joe quesada apologized for the sign , claiming that it was a mistake , added by the letterer at the last minute .
the character , first as agent steve rogers and later after resuming his identity as captain america , appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010–2013 " avengers " series , from issue #1 ( july *num* ) through its final issue #34 ( january *num* ) .
the character appeared as agent steve rogers as a regular character in the 2010–2013 " secret avengers " series , from issue #1 ( july *num* ) through issue #21 ( march *num* ) ; the character made guest appearances as captain america in issues #21 .
*num* , #22–23 , #35 , and the final issue of the series #37 ( march *num* ) .
marvel stated in may *num* that rogers , following the public death of bucky barnes in the " fear itself " miniseries , would resume his captain america identity in a sixth volume of " captain america " , by writer ed brubaker and artist steve mcniven .
the " captain america " title continued from issue #620 featuring team up stories with bucky ( #620-#628 ) , hawkeye ( #629-#632 ) , iron man ( #633–635 ) , namor ( #635 .
*num* ) , and black widow ( #636-#640 ) , and the title ended its print run with issue #640 .
captain america is a regular character in " uncanny avengers " ( *num* ) , beginning with issue #1 as part of marvel now ! .
" captain america " vol .
*num* was launched in november *num* with a january *num* cover date by writer rick remender and artist john romita jr .
.
on july *num* , *num* marvel comics announced that the mantle of captain america would be passed on by rogers ( who in the most recent storyline has been turned into a 90-year-old man ) to his long-time ally the falcon , with the series being relaunched as " all-new captain america " .
marvel announced that rogers will become captain america once again in the comic series " captain america : steve rogers " .
this new series follows the events of " , " in which captain america is restored to his youthful state following an encounter with the sentient cosmic cube , kobik , and his past is drastically rewritten under the instructions of the red skull .
afterward , captain america plots to set himself and hydra in a position where they can conquer america in marvel's event " secret empire .
" in *num* , joe simon sued the owners of marvel comics , asserting that he—not marvel—was legally entitled to renew the copyright upon the expiration of the original 28-year term .
the two parties settled out of court , with simon agreeing to a statement that the character had been created under terms of employment by the publisher , and therefore it was work for hire owned by them .
in *num* , simon filed to claim the copyright to captain america under a provision of the copyright act of *num* , which allowed the original creators of works that had been sold to corporations to reclaim them after the original 56-year copyright term ( but not the longer term enacted by the new legislation ) had expired .
marvel entertainment challenged the claim , arguing that the settlement of simon's *num* suit made the character ineligible for termination of the copyright transfer .
simon and marvel settled out of court in *num* , in a deal that paid simon royalties for merchandising and licensing use of the character .
steven rogers was born in the lower east side of manhattan , new york city , in *num* to poor irish immigrants , sarah and joseph rogers .
joseph died when steve was a child , and sarah died of pneumonia while steve was a teen .
by early *num* , before america's entry into world war ii , rogers is a tall , scrawny fine arts student specializing in illustration and a comic book writer and artist .
disturbed by adolf hitler's rise to power , rogers attempts to enlist but is rejected due to his frail body .
his resolution attracts the notice of u .
s .
army general chester phillips and " project : rebirth " .
rogers is used as a test subject for the super-soldier project , receiving a special serum made by " dr .
josef reinstein " , later retroactively changed to a code name for the scientist abraham erskine .
the serum is a success and transforms steve rogers into a nearly perfect human being with peak strength , agility , stamina , and intelligence .
the success of the program leaves erskine wondering about replicating the experiment on other human beings .
the process itself has been inconsistently detailed : while in the original material rogers is shown receiving injections of the super-serum , when the origin was retold in the 1960s , the comic code authority had already put a veto over graphic description of drug intake and abuse , and thus the super-serum was retconned into an oral formula .
later accounts hint at a combination of oral and intravenous treatments with a strenuous training regimen , culminating in the vita-ray exposure .
erskine refused to write down every crucial element of the treatment , leaving behind a flawed , imperfect knowledge of the steps .
thus , when the nazi spy heinz kruger killed him , erskine's method of creating new super-soldiers died .
captain america , in his first act after his transformation , avenges erskine .
in the *num* origin story and in " tales of suspense " #63 , kruger dies when running into machinery but is not killed by rogers ; in the " captain america " #109 and #255 revisions , rogers causes the spy's death by punching him into machinery .
unable to create new super-soldiers and willing to hide the project rebirth fiasco , the american government casts rogers as a patriotic superhero , able to counter the menace of the red skull as a counter-intelligence agent .
he is supplied with a patriotic uniform of his own design , a bulletproof shield , a personal side arm , and the codename captain america , while posing as a clumsy infantry private at camp lehigh in virginia .
he forms a friendship with the camp's teenage mascot , james buchanan " bucky " barnes .
barnes learns of rogers ' dual identity and offers to keep the secret if he can become captain america's sidekick .
during their adventures , franklin d .
roosevelt presents captain america with a new shield , forged from an alloy of steel and vibranium , fused by an unknown catalyst , so effective that it replaces his own firearm .
throughout world war ii , captain america and bucky fight the nazi menace both on their own and as members of the superhero team the invaders as seen in the 1970s comic of the same name .
captain america fights in numerous battles in world war ii , primarily as a member of *ord* battalion , *ord* infantry regiment " blue spaders " .
captain america battles a number of criminal menaces on american soil , including a wide variety of costumed villains : the wax man , the hangman , the fang , the black talon , and the white death , among others .
in addition to bucky , captain america was occasionally assisted by the sentinels of liberty .
sentinels of liberty was the title given to members of the " captain america comics " fan club who captain america sometimes addressed as an aside , or as characters in the " captain america comics " stories .
in late april *num* , during the closing days of world war ii , captain america and bucky try to stop the villainous baron zemo from destroying an experimental drone plane .
zemo launches the plane with an armed explosive on it with rogers and barnes in hot pursuit .
the pair reaches the plane just before take off .
when bucky tries to defuse the bomb , it explodes in mid-air .
rogers is hurled into the freezing waters of the north atlantic .
both are presumed dead , though it is later revealed that neither one died .
captain america appeared in comics for the next few years , changing from world war ii-era hero fighting the nazis to confronting the united states ' newest enemy , communism .
the revival of the character in the mid-1950s was short-lived , and events during that time period are later retconned to show that multiple people operated using the code name to explain the changes in the character .
these post world war ii successors are listed as william naslund and jeffrey mace .
the last of these other official captains , william burnside , was a history graduate enamored with the captain america mythos , having his appearance surgically altered to resemble rogers and legally changing his name to " steve rogers " , becoming the new " 1950s captain america " .
he administered to himself and his pupil james " jack " monroe a flawed , incomplete copy of the super-serum , which made no mention about the necessary vita-ray portion of the treatment .
as a result , while burnside and monroe became the new captain america and bucky , they became violently paranoid , often raving about innocent people being communist sympathizers during the height of the red scare of the 1950s .
their insanity forced the u .
s .
government to place them in indefinite cryogenic storage until they could be cured of their mental illness .
monroe would later be cured and assume the nomad identity .
years later , the superhero team the avengers discovers steve rogers ' body in the north atlantic .
after he revives , they piece together that rogers has been preserved in a block of ice since *num* , surviving because of his enhancements from project : rebirth .
the block began to melt after the sub-mariner , enraged that an inuit tribe is worshipping the frozen figure , throws it into the ocean .
rogers accepts membership in the avengers , and his experience in individual combat service and his time with the invaders makes him a valuable asset .
he quickly assumes leadership and has typically returned to that position throughout the team's history .
captain america is plagued by guilt for having been unable to prevent bucky's death .
although he takes the young rick jones ( who closely resembles bucky ) under his tutelage , he refuses for some time to allow jones to take up the bucky identity , not wishing to be responsible for another youth's death .
insisting that his hero move on from that loss , jones convinces rogers to let him don the bucky costume , but this partnership lasts only a short time ; a disguised red skull , impersonating rogers with the help of the cosmic cube , drives jones away .
rogers reunites with his old war comrade nick fury , who is similarly well-preserved due to the " infinity formula " .
as a result , rogers regularly undertakes missions for the security agency s .
h .
i .
e .
l .
d .
, for which fury is public director .
through fury , rogers befriends sharon carter , a s .
h .
i .
e .
l .
d .
agent , with whom he eventually begins a romantic relationship .
rogers later meets and trains sam wilson , who becomes the superhero the falcon , the first african-american superhero in mainstream comic books .
the characters established an enduring friendship and adventuring partnership , sharing the series title for some time as " captain america and the falcon " .
the two later encounter the revived but still insane 1950s captain america .
although rogers and the falcon defeat the faux rogers and jack monroe , rogers becomes deeply disturbed that he could have suffered his counterpart's fate .
during this period , rogers temporarily gains super strength .
the series dealt with the marvel universe's version of the watergate scandal , making rogers so uncertain about his role that he abandons his captain america identity in favor of one called nomad , emphasizing the word's meaning as " man without a country " .
during this time , several men unsuccessfully assume the captain america identity .
rogers eventually re-assumes it after coming to consider that the identity could be a symbol of american ideals and not its government ; it's a personal conviction epitomized when he later confronted a corrupt army officer attempting to manipulate him by appealing to his loyalty , " i'm loyal to nothing , general .
.
.
except the [ american ] dream .
" jack monroe , cured of his mental instability , later takes up the nomad alias .
sharon carter is believed to have been killed while under the mind control of dr .
faustus .
the 1980s included a run by writer roger stern and artist john byrne .
stern had rogers consider a run for president of the united states in " captain america " #250 ( june *num* ) , an idea originally developed by roger mckenzie and don perlin .
stern , in his capacity as editor of the title , originally rejected the idea but later changed his mind about the concept .
mckenzie and perlin received credit for the idea on the letters page at stern's insistence .
stern additionally introduced a new love interest , law student bernie rosenthal , in " captain america " #248 ( aug .
*num* ) .
writer j .
m .
dematteis revealed the true face and full origin of the red skull in " captain america " #298–300 , and had captain america take on jack monroe , nomad , as a partner for a time .
around this time , the heroes gathered by the beyonder elect rogers as leader during their stay on battleworld in the *num* miniseries " secret wars " .
homophobia is dealt with as rogers runs into a childhood friend named arnold roth who is gay .
mark gruenwald became the writer of the series with issue #307 ( july *num* ) and wrote *num* issues for *num* consecutive years from until #443 ( sept .
*num* ) , the most issues by any single author in the character's history .
gruenwald created several new foes , including crossbones and the serpent society .
other gruenwald characters included diamondback , super patriot , and demolition man .
gruenwald explored numerous political and social themes as well , such as extreme idealism when captain america fights the anti-nationalist terrorist flag-smasher ; and vigilantism when he hunts the murderous scourge of the underworld .
rogers receives a large back-pay reimbursement dating back to his disappearance at the end of world war ii , and a government commission orders him to work directly for the u .
s .
government .
already troubled by the corruption he had encountered with the nuke incident in new york city , rogers chooses instead to resign his identity , and then takes the alias of " the captain " .
a replacement captain america , john walker , struggles to emulate rogers ' ideals until pressure from hidden enemies helps to drive walker insane .
rogers returns to the captain america identity while a recovered walker becomes the u .
s .
agent .
sometime afterward , rogers avoids the explosion of a methamphetamine lab , but the drug triggers a chemical reaction in the super-soldier serum in his system .
to combat the reaction , rogers has the serum removed from his body and trains constantly to maintain his physical condition .
a retcon later establishes that the serum was not a drug " per se " , which would have metabolized out of his system , but in fact a virus-like organism that effected a biochemical and genetic change .
this additionally explained how nemesis the red skull , who at the time inhabited a body cloned from rogers ' cells , has the formula in his body .
because of his altered biochemistry , rogers ' body begins to deteriorate , and for a time he must wear a powered exoskeleton and is eventually placed again in suspended animation .
during this time , he is given a transfusion of blood from the red skull , which cures his condition and stabilizes the super-soldier virus in his system .
captain america returns to crime fighting and the avengers .
following gruenwald's departure from the series , mark waid took over and resurrected sharon carter as cap's love interest .
the title was then relaunched under rob liefeld as cap became part of the heroes reborn universe for *num* issues before another relaunch restored waid to the title in an arc that saw cap lose his shield for a time using an energy based shield as a temporary replacement .
following waid's run , dan jurgens took over and introduced new foe protocide , a failed recipient of the super soldier serum prior to the experiment that successfully created rogers .
some time after this , rogers ' original shield was retrieved , but subtle damage sustained during the battle with the beyonder resulted in it being shattered and a ' vibranium cancer ' being triggered that would destroy all vibranium in the world , with rogers nearly being forced to destroy the shield before a confrontation with the villain klaw saw klaw's attacks unwittingly repair the shield's fractured molecular bonds and negate the cancer .

the superhuman registration act is repealed and rogers re-establishes the superhero team the avengers , spearheaded by iron man , thor , and bucky as captain america .
in the miniseries " steve rogers : super soldier " , he encounters jacob erskine , the grandson of professor abraham erskine and the son of tyler paxton , one of rogers ' fellow volunteers in the super-soldier program .
shortly afterward , rogers becomes leader of the secret avengers , a black-ops superhero team .
during the " fear itself " storyline , steve rogers is present when the threat of the serpent is known .
following the apparent death of bucky at the hands of sin ( in the form of skadi ) , steve rogers ends up changing into his captain america uniform .
when the avengers and the new avengers are fighting skadi , the serpent ends up joining the battle and breaks captain america's shield with his bare hands .
captain america and the avengers teams end up forming a militia for a last stand against the forces of the serpent .
when it comes to the final battle , captain america uses thor's hammer to fight skadi until thor manages to kill the serpent .
in the aftermath of the battle , iron man presents him with his reforged shield , now stronger for its uru-infused enhancements despite the scar it bears .
it is then revealed that captain america , nick fury , and black widow are the only ones who know that bucky actually survived the fight with skadi as bucky resumes his identity as winter soldier .
in the " avengers vs .
x-men " story arc , captain america attempts to apprehend hope summers of the x-men .
she is the targeted vessel for the phoenix force , a destructive cosmic entity .
captain america believes that this phoenix force is too dangerous to entrust in one person and seeks to prevent hope from having it .
cyclops and the x-men believe that the phoenix force will save their race , and oppose captain america's wishes .
the result is a series of battles that eventually take both teams to the blue area of the moon .
the phoenix force eventually possesses the five x-men present , leaving the avengers at an extreme disadvantage .
the " phoenix five " , who become corrupted by the power of the phoenix , are eventually defeated and scattered , with cyclops imprisoned for turning the world into a police state and murdering charles xavier after being pushed too far , only for him to note that , in the end , he was proven right about the phoenix's intentions .
from there , captain america proceeds to assemble the avengers unity squad , a new team of avengers composed of both classic avengers and x-men .
after cyclops was incarcerated , and steve accepted the avengers should have done more to help mutants , and allowed the world to hate them , he started planning a new sub-team of avengers in the hopes of unifying mutant and humankind alike .
he chose havok to lead his team and become the new face to represent mutants as professor x and cyclops once were .
their first threat was the return of the red skull- more specifically , a clone of the skull created in *num* and kept in stasis in the event of the original's death- who usurped professor x's body to provide himself with telepathic powers , which he would use to provoke citizens of new york into a mass assault against mutants , or anyone who could be one , and force the scarlet witch and rogue to allow themselves to be attacked .
with the help of the s-man honest john , he managed to even manipulate thor .
the red skull's skills were still erratic , and could not completely control captain america , an attack against him was enough of a distraction to lose control of rogue and the scarlet witch .
after being overpowered by the rest of the uncanny avengers , the red skull escapes , but promises to return .
in the aftermath , both rogue and the scarlet witch joined the team .
during a battle with an enemy called the iron nail , the super-soldier serum within rogers's body was neutralized , causing him to age rapidly to match his chronological age of over *num* years .
no longer able to take part in field missions but retaining his sharp mind , rogers decided to take on a role as mission coordinator , organizing the avengers ' plans of attack from the mansion , while appointing sam wilson as his official " replacement " as captain america .
when various avengers and x-men were inverted into villains and several villains inverted into heroism due to a miscast spell by the scarlet witch and doctor doom , rogers not only coordinated the efforts of spider-man and the inverted villains , now called the " astonishing avengers " , but also donned his old armor to battle the inverted falcon , until the heroes and villains could be returned to normal with the aid of the white skull ( the inverted red skull ) .
during the " time runs out " storyline , steve rogers wears armor when he confronts iron man .
the ensuing fight between the two old friends led steve rogers to force iron man to admit that he had lied to him and all of their allies , when he had known about the incursions between alternate earths all along , but iron man also confessed that he wouldn't change a thing .

after defeating logan and bringing him to alberta , canada , rogers tried to " reassure " logan that this was not " his " past by showing him the adamantium-frozen body of earth-616's logan .
this sight reminds logan of the need to enjoy being alive rather than brooding over the ghosts of his past .
although he told steve rogers what he had experienced in his timeline , logan declined steve's offer of help .

has established pleasant hill , a gated community where they use kobik to transform villains into ordinary citizens .
when rogers is brought to pleasant hill , he confronts maria hill about the kobik project .
their argument is interrupted when baron helmut zemo and fixer restore the inmates to normal .
after hill is injured , rogers convinces zemo to let hill get medical attention .
rogers is then escorted to dr .
erik selvig's clinic by father patrick .
selvig tells rogers that kobik is at the pleasant hill bowling alley .
during an attempt to reason with kobik , rogers is attacked by crossbones .
before rogers can be killed , kobik uses her abilities to restore him back to his prime .
declaring that " it's good to be back , " steve defeats crossbones as captain america and the winter soldier catch up with him .
they resume their search for kobik , and discover that baron zemo had fixer invent a device that would make kobik subservient to them .
rogers rallies the heroes so that they can take the fight to zemo .
in the aftermath of the incident , steve and sam plan to keep what happened at pleasant hill under wraps for the time being .
in " captain america : steve rogers " #1 ( july *num* ) , the final panel apparently revealed that rogers has been a hydra double-agent since his early youth .
this is subsequently revealed to be the result of kobik's restoration of rogers ' youth , as she had been taught by the red skull that hydra was good for the world , and having the mind of a four-year-old child , kobik changed reality so that rogers would be the greatest man he could be : believing hydra to be good , kobik permanently altered his memories so that rogers believed that he had always been a member of hydra .

, erik selvig , as well as knowing of jack flag's tragic life and his immortality , which is why steve pushes him from zemo's airplane ( resulting in coma , not death ) .
additionally , it is revealed that rogers ' abusive father , joseph , was actually killed by hydra , and that hydra deceived him into thinking joseph died of a heart attack .
it is also revealed that rogers witnessed his mother , sarah , being killed by sinclair's hydra goons and kidnapped him , which is the reason why steve held a grudge towards hydra's evilness and plans to kill the red skull's clone and restore hydra's lost honor .
as part of his long-term plans , steve further compromised sam wilson's current image as ' the ' captain america by using his greater familiarity with the shield to deliberately put wilson in a position where he would be unable to use the shield to save a senator from flag-smasher , with the final goal of demoralizing sam to the point where he will return the shield to rogers of his own free will , not wanting to kill wilson and risk creating a martyr .
during the *num* " civil war ii " storyline , with the discovery of new inhuman ulysses – who has the ability to " predict " the future by calculating complex patterns – rogers has set out to prevent ulysses from learning of his true plans and allegiance .
rogers does this by " forcing " certain predictions on him , such as anonymously providing bruce banner with new gamma research to provoke a vision that would drive the avengers to kill banner , although this plan has apparently backfired with a recent vision showing the new spider-man standing over the dead steve rogers .
despite this revelation , rogers presents himself as the voice of reason by allowing spider-man to flee with thor .
this inspires doubt in tony stark for his current stance by suggesting that he is just acting against danvers because he does not like being top dog .
he then goes to washington , d .
c .
, the location seen in ulysses ' vision , to talk to spider-man , who was trying to understand the vision like he was .
when captain marvel attempts to arrest spider-man , tony , wearing the war machine armor , confronts her and the two begin to fight .
later , rogers goes to sokovia and joins forces with black widow to liberate freedom fighters from a prison so they can reclaim their country .
after that , he goes to his base where doctor selvig expresses concern of his plan to kill the red skull .
he then reveals that he has baron zemo in a cell , planning to recruit him .
he eventually kills the skull after the villain is captured by the unity squad and the xavier brain fragment extracted by the beast , rogers throwing the skull out of a window over a cliff after sin and crossbones affirm their new allegiance to rogers .
in the *num* " secret empire " storyline , rogers , as the head of s .
h .
i .
e .
l .
d , uses a subsequent alien invasion and a mass supervillain assault in order to seize control of the united states .
he neutralizes the superheroes that might oppose him , and seeks the cosmic cube to bring about a reality in which hydra won world war ii .
when rick smuggles information about the cube's rewriting of rogers ' reality to the remaining free avengers , a disheveled , bearded man in a torn world war ii army uniform appears who introduces himself as steve rogers .
as the avengers and hydra search for fragments of the shattered cube , it is revealed that this amnesic steve rogers is actually a manifestation of rogers existing within the cube itself , created by kobik's memories of rogers before he was converted to hydra , as she comes to recognize that her decision to ' rewrite ' rogers as an agent of hydra was wrong .
although hydra rogers is able to mostly reassemble the cosmic cube , sam wilson and bucky are able to use a fragment of the cube to restore the ' memory ' of pre-hydra rogers in the cube to corporeal existence , allowing him to defeat his hydra self , subsequently using the cube to undo most of the damage caused by hydra manipulating reality even if the physical damage remains .
' hydra cap ' continues to exist as a separate entity and is kept trapped in a prison where he is the only inmate , mocking the restored rogers about the challenge he will face rebuilding his reputation even as rogers muses that this experience will teach everyone not to place such blind trust in another .
rogers ' battle experience and training make him an expert tactician and an excellent field commander , with his teammates frequently deferring to his orders in battle .
thor has stated that rogers is one of the very few humans he will take orders from and follow " through the gates of hades " .
rogers ' reflexes and senses are extraordinarily keen .
he has blended aikido , boxing , judo , karate , jujutsu , kickboxing , and gymnastics into his own unique fighting style and is a master of multiple martial arts .
years of practice with his near-indestructible shield make him able to aim and throw it with almost unerring accuracy .
his skill with his shield is such that he can attack multiple targets in succession with a single throw or even cause a boomerang-like return from a throw to attack an enemy from behind .
in canon , he is regarded by other skilled fighters as one of the best hand-to-hand combatants in the marvel universe , limited only by his human physique .
although the super-soldier serum is an important part of his strength , rogers has shown himself still sufficiently capable against stronger opponents , even when the serum has been deactivated reverting him to his pre-captain america physique .
rogers has vast u .
s .
military knowledge and is often shown to be familiar with ongoing , classified defense department operations .
he is an expert in combat strategy , survival , acrobatics , parkour , military strategy , piloting , and demolitions .
despite his high profile as one of the world's most popular and recognizable superheroes , rogers has a broad understanding of the espionage community , largely through his ongoing relationship with s .

the formula enhances all of his metabolic functions and prevents the build-up of fatigue poisons in his muscles , giving him endurance far in excess of an ordinary human being .
this accounts for many of his extraordinary feats , including bench pressing and running a mile ( *num* .
*num* km ) in *num* seconds ( *num* mph / *num* kph , nearly twice the maximum speed achieved by the best human sprinters ) .
furthermore , his enhancements are the reason why he was able to survive being frozen in suspended animation for decades .
he is highly resistant to hypnosis or gases that could limit his focus .
the secrets of creating a super-soldier were lost with the death of its creator , dr .
abraham erskine .
in the ensuing decades there have been numerous attempts to recreate erskine's treatment , only to have them end in failure .
even worse , the attempts have instead often created psychopathic supervillains of which captain america's 1950s imitator and nuke are the most notorious examples .
steve rodgers is often considered to be the pinnacle of human potential and operates at peak physical performance due to his enhancement via the super soldier serum .
captain america has used multiple shields throughout his history , the most prevalent of which is a nigh-indestructible disc-shaped shield made from an experimental alloy of steel and the fictional vibranium .
the shield was cast by american metallurgist dr .
myron maclain , who was contracted by the u .
s .
government , from orders of president franklin d .
roosevelt , to create an impenetrable substance to use for tanks during world war ii .
this alloy was created by accident and never duplicated , although efforts to reverse-engineer it resulted in the discovery of adamantium .
captain america often uses his shield as an offensive throwing weapon .
the first instance of captain america's trademark ricocheting shield-toss occurs in stan lee's first comics writing , the two-page text story " captain america foils the traitor's revenge " in " captain america comics " #3 ( may *num* ) .
the legacy of the shield among other comics characters includes the time-traveling mutant superhero cable telling captain america that his shield still exists in one of the possible futures ; cable carries it into battle and brandishes it as a symbol .
when without his trademark shield , captain america sometimes uses other shields made from less durable metals such as steel , or even a photonic energy shield designed to mimic a vibranium matrix .
rogers , having relinquished his regular shield to barnes , carried a variant of the energy shield which can be used with either arm , and used to either block attacks or as an improvised offensive weapon able to cut through metal with relative ease .
much like his vibranium shield , the energy shield can be thrown , including ricocheting off multiple surfaces and returning to his hand .
captain america's uniform is made of a fire-retardant material , and he wears a lightweight , bulletproof duralumin scale armor beneath his uniform for added protection .
originally , rogers ' mask was a separate piece of material , but an early engagement had it dislodged , thus almost exposing his identity .
to prevent a recurrence of the situation , rogers modified the mask with connecting material to his uniform , an added benefit of which was extending his armor to cover his previously exposed neck .
as a member of the avengers , rogers has an avengers priority card , which serves as a communications device .
captain america has used a custom specialized motorcycle , modified by the s .
h .
i .
e .
l .
d .
weapons laboratory , as well as a custom-built battle van , constructed by the wakanda design group with the ability to change its color for disguise purposes ( red , white and blue ) , and fitted to store and conceal the custom motorcycle in its rear section with a frame that allows rogers to launch from the vehicle riding it .
captain america has faced numerous foes in over *num* years of published adventures .
many of his recurring foes embody ideologies contrary to the american values that captain america is shown to strive for and believes in .
some examples of these opposing values are nazism ( red skull , baron zemo ) , neo-nazism ( crossbones , doctor faustus ) , technocratic fascism ( aim , arnim zola ) , communism ( aleksander lukin ) , anarchism ( flag smasher ) and international and domestic terrorism ( hydra ) .
cross ownership cross ownership is a method of reinforcing business relationships by owning stock in the companies with which a given company does business .
heavy cross ownership is referred to as circular ownership .
in the us , " cross ownership " also refers to a type of investment in different mass-media properties in one market .
some countries where cross ownership of shares is a major part of the business culture are : positives of cross ownership : cross ownership of shares is criticized for : a major factor in perpetuating cross ownership of shares is a high capital gains tax rate .
a company has less incentive to sell cross owned shares if taxes are high because of the immediate reduction in the value of the assets .
for example , a company owns $1000 of stock in another company that was originally purchased for $200 .
if the capital gains tax rate is *num* % ( like germany ) and the company sells the stock , the company has $800 which is *num* percent less than before it sold the stock .
long term cross ownership of shares combined with a high capital tax rate greatly increases periods of asset deflation both in time and in severity .
cross ownership also refers to a type of media ownership in which one type of communications ( say a newspaper ) owns or is the sister company of another type of medium ( such as a radio or tv station ) .
one example is " the new york times " ' s former ownership of wqxr radio and the " chicago tribune"'s similar relationship with wgn radio ( wgn-am ) and television ( wgn-tv ) .
the federal communications commission generally does not allow cross ownership , to keep from one license holder having too much local media ownership , unless the license holder obtains a waiver , such as news corporation and the tribune company have in new york .
the mid-1970s cross-ownership guidelines grandfathered already-existing crossownerships , such as " tribune"-wgn , " new york times"-wqxr and the " new york daily news " ownership of wpix television and radio .
albertosaurus albertosaurus ( ; meaning " alberta lizard " ) is a genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaurs that lived in western north america during the late cretaceous period , about *num* million years ago .
the type species , " a .
sarcophagus " , was apparently restricted in range to the modern-day canadian province of alberta , after which the genus is named .
scientists disagree on the content of the genus , with some recognizing " gorgosaurus libratus " as a second species .
as a tyrannosaurid , " albertosaurus " was a bipedal predator with tiny , two-fingered hands and a massive head that had dozens of large , sharp teeth .
it may have been at the top of the food chain in its local ecosystem .
while " albertosaurus " was large for a theropod , it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative " tyrannosaurus rex " , growing nine to ten meters long and possibly weighing less than *num* metric tons .
since the first discovery in *num* , fossils of more than *num* individuals have been recovered , providing scientists with a more detailed knowledge of " albertosaurus " anatomy than is available for most other tyrannosaurids .
the discovery of *num* individuals at one site provides evidence of pack behaviour and allows studies of ontogeny and population biology , which are impossible with lesser-known dinosaurs .
"albertosaurus " was smaller than some other tyrannosaurids , such as " tarbosaurus " and " tyrannosaurus " .
typical " albertosaurus " adults measured up to long , while rare individuals of great age could grow to be over long .
several independent mass estimates , obtained by different methods , suggest that an adult " albertosaurus " weighed between *num* .
*num* tonnes and *num* .
*num* tonnes ( *num* .
*num* tons ) .
"albertosaurus " shared a similar body appearance with all other tyrannosaurids .
typically for a theropod , " albertosaurus " was bipedal and balanced the heavy head and torso with a long tail .
however , tyrannosaurid forelimbs were extremely small for their body size and retained only two digits .
the hind limbs were long and ended in a four-toed foot on which the first digit , called the hallux , was short and did not reach the ground .
the third digit was longer than the rest .
" albertosaurus " may have been able to reach walking speeds of 14−21 km / hour ( 8−13 mi / hour ) .
at least for the younger individuals , a high running speed is plausible .
two skin impressions from " albertosaurus " are known , both showing scales .
one patch is found with some gastralic ribs and the impression of a long , unknown bone , indicating that the patch is from the belly .
the scales are pebbly and gradually become larger and somewhat hexagonal in shape .
also preserved are two larger feature scales , placed *num* , *num* cm apart from each other .
another skin impression is from an unknown part of the body .
these scales are small , diamond-shaped and arranged in rows .
the massive skull of " albertosaurus " , which was perched on a short , s-shaped neck , was about long in the largest adults .
wide openings in the skull ( fenestrae ) reduced the weight of the head while also providing space for muscle attachment and sensory organs .
its long jaws contained , both sides combined , *num* or more banana-shaped teeth ; larger tyrannosaurids possessed fewer teeth , " gorgosaurus " at least *num* .
unlike most theropods , " albertosaurus " and other tyrannosaurids were heterodont , with teeth of different forms depending on their position in the mouth .
the premaxillary teeth at the tip of the upper jaw , four per side , were much smaller than the rest , more closely packed , and d-shaped in cross section .
like with " tyrannosaurus " , the maxillary ( cheek ) teeth of " albertosaurus " were adapted in general form to resist lateral forces exerted by a struggling prey .
the bite force of " albertosaurus " was less formidable , however , with the maximum force , by the hind teeth , reaching *num* , *num* newtons .
above the eyes were short bony crests that may have been brightly coloured in life and used in courtship to attract a mate .
william abler observed in *num* that " albertosaurus " tooth serrations resemble a crack in the tooth ending in a round void called an ampulla .
tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling flesh off a body , so when a tyrannosaur pulled back on a piece of meat , the tension could cause a purely crack-like serration to spread through the tooth .
however , the presence of the ampulla distributed these forces over a larger surface area , and lessened the risk of damage to the tooth under strain .
the presence of incisions ending in voids has parallels in human engineering .
guitar makers use incisions ending in voids to , as abler describes , " impart alternating regions of flexibility and rigidity " to wood they work .
the use of a drill to create an " ampulla " of sorts and prevent the propagation of cracks through material is also used to protect aircraft surfaces .
abler demonstrated that a plexiglass bar with incisions called " kerfs " and drilled holes was more than *num* % stronger than one with only regularly placed incisions .
unlike tyrannosaurs , ancient predators like phytosaurs and " dimetrodon " had no adaptations to prevent the crack-like serrations of their teeth from spreading when subjected to the forces of feeding .
"albertosaurus " was named by henry fairfield osborn in a one-page note at the end of his *num* description of " tyrannosaurus rex " .
the name honours alberta , the canadian province established the same year , in which the first remains were found .
the generic name also incorporates the greek term " σαυρος" / "sauros " ( " lizard " ) , the most common suffix in dinosaur names .
the type species is " albertosaurus sarcophagus " ; the specific name is derived from ancient greek σαρκοφάγος ( " sarkophagos " ) meaning " flesh-eating " and having the same etymology as the funeral container with which it shares its name : a combination of the greek words σαρξ / "sarx " ( " flesh " ) and φαγειν / "phagein " ( " to eat " ) .
more than *num* specimens of all ages are known to science .
the type specimen is a partial skull , collected in the summer of *num* from an outcrop of the horseshoe canyon formation alongside the red deer river , in alberta .
this specimen , found on june *num* , *num* , was recovered by an expedition of the geological survey of canada , led by the famous geologist joseph burr tyrrell .
due to a lack of specialised equipment the almost complete skull could only be partially secured .
in *num* , tyrrell's colleague thomas chesmer weston found an incomplete smaller skull associated with some skeletal material at a location nearby .
the two skulls were assigned to the preexisting species " laelaps incrassatus " by edward drinker cope in *num* , although the name " laelaps " was preoccupied by a genus of mite and had been changed to " dryptosaurus " in *num* by othniel charles marsh .
cope refused to recognize the new name created by his archrival marsh .
however , lawrence lambe used the name " dryptosaurus incrassatus " instead of " laelaps incrassatus " when he described the remains in detail in *num* and *num* , a combination first coined by oliver perry hay in *num* .
shortly later , osborn pointed out that " d .
incrassatus " was based on generic tyrannosaurid teeth , so the two horseshoe canyon skulls could not be confidently referred to that species .
the horseshoe canyon skulls also differed markedly from the remains of " d .
aquilunguis " , type species of " dryptosaurus " , so osborn created the new name " albertosaurus sarcophagus " for them in *num* .
he did not describe the remains in any great detail , citing lambe's complete description the year before .
both specimens ( the holotype cmn *num* and the paratype cmn *num* ) are stored in the canadian museum of nature in ottawa .
by the early twenty-first century , some concerns had arisen that , due to the damaged state of the holotype , " albertosaurus " might be a " nomen dubium " , a " dubious name " that could only be used for the type specimen itself because other fossils could not reliably be assigned to it .
however , in *num* , thomas carr established that the holotype , the paratype and comparable later finds all shared a single common unique trait or autapomorphy : the possession of an enlarged pneumatic opening in the back rim of the side of the palatine bone , proving that " albertosaurus " was a valid taxon .
on *num* august *num* , american paleontologist barnum brown discovered the remains of a large group of " albertosaurus " at another quarry alongside the red deer river .
because of the large number of bones and the limited time available , brown's party did not collect every specimen , but made sure to collect remains from all of the individuals that they could identify in the bonebed .
among the bones deposited in the american museum of natural history collections in new york city are seven sets of right metatarsals , along with two isolated toe bones that did not match any of the metatarsals in size .
this indicated the presence of at least nine individuals in the quarry .
palaeontologist philip j .
currie of the royal tyrrell museum of palaeontology rediscovered the bonebed in *num* and resumed fieldwork at the site , which is now located inside dry island buffalo jump provincial park .
further excavation from *num* to *num* turned up the remains of *num* more individuals of various ages , including a diminutive two-year-old and a very old individual estimated at over in length .
none of these individuals are known from complete skeletons , and most are represented by remains in both museums .
excavations continued until *num* , when the minimum number of individuals present had been established at *num* , on the basis of preserved elements that occur only once in a skeleton , and at *num* if mirrored elements were counted when differing in size due to ontogeny .
a total of *num* , *num* " albertosaurus " bones had been secured , the largest concentration of large theropod fossils known from the cretaceous .
in *num* , barnum brown , during the second year of american museum of natural history operations in alberta , uncovered a fragmentary partial " albertosaurus " skull at the red deer river near tolman bridge , specimen amnh *num* .
william parks described a new species in *num* , " albertosaurus arctunguis " , based on a partial skeleton lacking the skull excavated by gus lindblad and ralph hornell near the red deer river in *num* , but this species has been considered identical to " a .
sarcophagus " since *num* .
parks ' specimen ( rom *num* ) is housed in the royal ontario museum in toronto .
between *num* and *num* , no " albertosaurus " fossils were found at all ; but , since the seventies , there has been a steady increase in the known material .
apart from the dry island bonebed , six more skulls and skeletons have since been discovered in alberta and are housed in various canadian museums : specimens rtmp *num* .

however , due to vandalism and accidents , no undamaged and complete skulls could be secured among these finds .
fossils have also been reported from the american states of montana , new mexico , and wyoming , but these probably do not represent " a .
sarcophagus " and may not even belong to the genus " albertosaurus " .
in *num* , paleontologist charles h .
sternberg recovered another tyrannosaurid skeleton from the slightly older dinosaur park formation in alberta .
lawrence lambe named this dinosaur " gorgosaurus libratus " in *num* .
other specimens were later found in alberta and the us state of montana .
finding , largely due to a lack of good " albertosaurus " skull material , no significant differences to separate the two taxa , dale russell declared the name " gorgosaurus " a junior synonym of " albertosaurus " , which had been named first , and " g .
libratus " was renamed " albertosaurus libratus " in *num* .
a species distinction was maintained because of the age difference .
this addition extended the temporal range of the genus " albertosaurus " backwards by several million years and its geographic range southwards by hundreds of kilometres .
in *num* , philip j .
currie , benefiting from much more extensive finds and a general increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods , compared several tyrannosaurid skulls and came to the conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought .
the decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary , as the two species are sister taxa , more closely related to each other than to any other species .
recognizing this , currie nevertheless recommended that " albertosaurus " and " gorgosaurus " be retained as separate genera , as he concluded that they were no more similar than " daspletosaurus " and " tyrannosaurus " , which are almost always separated .
in addition , several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from alaska and new mexico , and currie suggested that the " albertosaurus"-"gorgosaurus " situation may be clarified once these are described fully .
most authors have followed currie's recommendation , but some have not .
apart from " a .
sarcophagus " , " a .
arctunguis " and " a .
libratus " , several other species of " albertosaurus " have been named .
all of these are today seen as younger synonyms of other species or as " nomina dubia " , and are not assigned to " albertosaurus " .
in *num* , anatoly nikolaevich riabinin named " albertosaurus pericolosus " based on a tooth from china , that probably belonged to " tarbosaurus " .
in *num* , friedrich von huene renamed " dryptosaurus incrassatus " , not considered a " nomen dubium " by him , to " albertosaurus incrassatus " .
because he had identified " gorgosaurus " with " albertosaurus " , in *num* , russell also renamed " gorgosaurus sternbergi " ( matthew & brown *num* ) into " albertosaurus sternbergi " and " gorgosaurus lancensis " ( gilmore *num* ) into " albertosaurus lancensis " .
the former species is today seen as a juvenile form of " gorgosaurus libratus " , the latter as either identical to " tyrannosaurus " or representing a separate genus " nanotyrannus " .
in *num* , gregory s .
paul based " albertosaurus megagracilis " on a small tyrannosaurid skeleton , specimen lacm *num* , from the hell creek formation of montana .
it was renamed " dinotyrannus " in *num* , but is now thought to represent a juvenile " tyrannosaurus rex " .
also in *num* , paul renamed " alectrosaurus olseni " ( gilmore *num* ) into " albertosaurus olseni " ; this has found no general acceptance .
in *num* , " gorgosaurus novojilovi " ( maleev *num* ) was renamed by bryn mader and robert bradley as " albertosaurus novojilovi " ; today this is seen as a synonym of " tarbosaurus " .
on two occasions , species based on valid " albertosaurus " material were reassigned to a different genus : in *num* william diller matthew renamed " a .
sarcophagus " into " deinodon sarcophagus " and in *num* german paleontologist oskar kuhn renamed " a .
arctunguis " into " deinodon arctunguis " .
"albertosaurus " is a member of the theropod family tyrannosauridae , in the subfamily albertosaurinae .
its closest relative is the slightly older " gorgosaurus libratus " ( sometimes called " albertosaurus libratus " ; see below ) .
these two species are the only described albertosaurines ; other undescribed species may exist .
thomas holtz found " appalachiosaurus " to be an albertosaurine in *num* , but his more recent unpublished work locates it just outside tyrannosauridae , in agreement with other authors .
the other major subfamily of tyrannosaurids is the tyrannosaurinae , which includes " daspletosaurus " , " tarbosaurus " and " tyrannosaurus " .
compared with these robust tyrannosaurines , albertosaurines had slender builds , with proportionately smaller skulls and longer bones of the lower leg ( tibia ) and feet ( metatarsals and phalanges ) .
below is the cladogram of the tyrannosauridae based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by loewen " et al .
" in *num* .
most age categories of " albertosaurus " are represented in the fossil record .
using bone histology , the age of an individual animal at the time of death can often be determined , allowing growth rates to be estimated and compared with other species .
the youngest known " albertosaurus " is a two-year-old discovered in the dry island bonebed , which would have weighed about *num* kilograms ( *num* lb ) and measured slightly more than in length .
the specimen from the same quarry is the oldest and largest known , at *num* years of age .
when specimens of intermediate age and size are plotted on a graph , an " s"-shaped growth curve results , with the most rapid growth occurring in a four-year period ending around the sixteenth year of life , a pattern also seen in other tyrannosaurids .
the growth rate during this phase was per year , based on an adult *num* .
*num* tonnes .
other studies have suggested higher adult weights ; this would affect the magnitude of the growth rate , but not the overall pattern .
tyrannosaurids similar in size to " albertosaurus " had similar growth rates , although the much larger " tyrannosaurus rex " grew at almost five times this rate ( per year ) at its peak .
the end of the rapid growth phase suggests the onset of sexual maturity in " albertosaurus " , although growth continued at a slower rate throughout the animals ' lives .
sexual maturation while still actively growing appears to be a shared trait among small and large dinosaurs as well as in large mammals such as humans and elephants .
this pattern of relatively early sexual maturation differs strikingly from the pattern in birds , which delay their sexual maturity until after they have finished growing .
during growth , through thickening the tooth morphology changed so much that , had the association of young and adult skeletons on the dry island bonebed not proven they belonged to the same taxon , the teeth of juveniles would likely have been identified by statistical analysis as those of a different species .
most known " albertosaurus " individuals were aged *num* years or more at the time of death .
juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons , mainly preservation bias , where the smaller bones of younger animals were less likely to be preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults , and collection bias , where smaller fossils are less likely to be noticed by collectors in the field .
young " albertosaurus " are relatively large for juvenile animals , but their remains are still rare in the fossil record compared with adults .
it has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of life history , rather than bias , and that fossils of juvenile " albertosaurus " are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did .
a hypothesis of " albertosaurus " life history postulates that hatchlings died in large numbers , but have not been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction .
after just two years , juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult " albertosaurus " , and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals .
this resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains .
mortality rates doubled at age twelve , perhaps the result of the physiological demands of the rapid growth phase , and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen .
this elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood , perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation , including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources , and eventually , the ever-increasing effects of senescence .
the higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation .
very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes .
high infant mortality rates , followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity , with very few animals reaching maximum size , is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals , including elephants , african buffalo , and rhinoceros .
the same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids .
the comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis , but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role , especially since more than two-thirds of all " albertosaurus " specimens are known from one locality .
the dry island bonebed discovered by barnum brown and his crew contains the remains of *num* " albertosaurus " , the most individuals found in one locality of any large cretaceous theropod , and the second-most of any large theropod dinosaur behind the " allosaurus " assemblage at the cleveland-lloyd dinosaur quarry in utah .
the group seems to be composed of one very old adult ; eight adults between *num* and *num* years old ; seven sub-adults undergoing their rapid growth phases at between *num* and *num* years old ; and six juveniles between the ages of *num* and *num* years , who had not yet reached the growth phase .
the near-absence of herbivore remains and the similar state of preservation common to the many individuals at the " albertosaurus " bonebed quarry led currie to conclude that the locality was not a predator trap like the la brea tar pits in california , and that all of the preserved animals died at the same time .
currie claims this as evidence of pack behaviour .
other scientists are skeptical , observing that the animals may have been driven together by drought , flood or for other reasons .
there is plentiful evidence for gregarious behaviour among herbivorous dinosaurs , including ceratopsians and hadrosaurs .
however , only rarely are so many dinosaurian predators found at the same site .
small theropods like " deinonychus " and " coelophysis " have been found in aggregations , as have larger predators like " allosaurus " and " mapusaurus " .
there is some evidence of gregarious behaviour in other tyrannosaurids as well .
fragmentary remains of smaller individuals were found alongside " sue " , the " tyrannosaurus " mounted in the field museum of natural history in chicago , and a bonebed in the two medicine formation of montana contains at least three specimens of " daspletosaurus " , preserved alongside several hadrosaurs .
these findings may corroborate the evidence for social behaviour in " albertosaurus " , although some or all of the above localities may represent temporary or unnatural aggregations .
others have speculated that instead of social groups , at least some of these finds represent komodo dragon-like mobbing of carcasses , where aggressive competition leads to some of the predators being killed and cannibalized .
currie has also speculated on the pack-hunting habits of " albertosaurus " .
the leg proportions of the smaller individuals were comparable to those of ornithomimids , which were probably among the fastest dinosaurs .
younger " albertosaurus " were probably equally fleet-footed , or at least faster than their prey .
currie hypothesized that the younger members of the pack may have been responsible for driving their prey towards the adults , who were larger and more powerful , but also slower .
juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults , filling predator niches between the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods , the largest of which were two orders of magnitude smaller than adult " albertosaurus " in mass .
a similar situation is observed in modern komodo dragons , with hatchlings beginning life as small insectivores before growing to become the dominant predators on their islands .
however , as the preservation of behaviour in the fossil record is exceedingly rare , these ideas cannot readily be tested .
in *num* , currie , though still favouring the hunting pack hypothesis , admitted that the concentration could have been brought about by other causes , such as a slowly rising water level during an extended flood .
in *num* , researchers hypothesized that smooth-edged holes found in the fossil jaws of tyrannosaurid dinosaurs such as " albertosaurus " were caused by a parasite similar to " trichomonas gallinae " , which infects birds .
they suggested that tyrannosaurids transmitted the infection by biting each other , and that the infection impaired their ability to eat food .
in *num* , bruce rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior .
they found that only one of the *num* " albertosaurus " foot bones checked for stress fractures actually had them and none of the four hand bones did .
the scientists found that stress fractures were " significantly " less common in " albertosaurus " than in the carnosaur " allosaurus " .
rom *num* , the holotype of " a .
arctunguis " ( now referred to " a .
sarcophagus " ) , had a deep hole in the iliac blade , although the describer of the species did not recognize this as pathological .
the specimen also contains some exostosis on the fourth left metatarsal .
in *num* , two of the five " albertosaurus sarcophagus " specimens with humeri were reported by dale russel as having pathological damage to them .
in *num* , the health of the dry island " albertosaurus " assembly was reported upon .
most specimens showed no sign of disease .
on three phalanges of the foot strange bony spurs , consisting of abnormal ossifications of the tendons , so-called enthesophytes , were present , their cause unknown .
two ribs and a belly-rib showed signs of breaking and healing .
one adult specimen had a left lower jaw showing a puncture wound and both healed and unhealed bite marks .
the low number of abnormalities compares favourably with the health condition of a " majungasaurus " population of which it in *num* was established that *num* % of individuals showed bone pathologies .
according to a scientific paper published in *num* , " albertosaurus " could exert a bite force of around *num* , *num* newtons .
all identifiable fossils of " albertosaurus sarcophagus " are known from the upper horseshoe canyon formation in alberta .
these younger units of this geologic formation date to the early maastrichtian stage of the late cretaceous period , *num* to *num* ma ( million years ago ) .
immediately below this formation is the bearpaw shale , a marine formation representing a section of the western interior seaway .
the seaway was receding as the climate cooled and sea levels subsided towards the end of the cretaceous , exposing land that had previously been underwater .
it was not a smooth process , however , and the seaway would periodically rise to cover parts of the region throughout horseshoe canyon before finally receding altogether in the years after .
due to the changing sea levels , many different environments are represented in the horseshoe canyon formation , including offshore and near-shore marine habitats and coastal habitats like lagoons , estuaries and tidal flats .
numerous coal seams represent ancient peat swamps .
like most of the other vertebrate fossils from the formation , " albertosaurus " remains are found in deposits laid down in the deltas and floodplains of large rivers during the later half of horseshoe canyon times .
the fauna of the horseshoe canyon formation is well-known , as vertebrate fossils , including those of dinosaurs , are quite common .
sharks , rays , sturgeons , bowfins , gars and the gar-like " aspidorhynchus " made up the fish fauna .
mammals included multituberculates and the marsupial " didelphodon " .
the saltwater plesiosaur " leurospondylus " has been found in marine sediments in the horseshoe canyon , while freshwater environments were populated by turtles , " champsosaurus " , and crocodilians like " leidyosuchus " and " stangerochampsa " .
dinosaurs dominate the fauna , especially hadrosaurs , which make up half of all dinosaurs known , including the genera " edmontosaurus " , " saurolophus " and " hypacrosaurus " .
ceratopsians and ornithomimids were also very common , together making up another third of the known fauna .
along with much rarer ankylosaurians and pachycephalosaurs , all of these animals would have been prey for a diverse array of carnivorous theropods , including troodontids , dromaeosaurids , and caenagnathids .
intermingled with the " albertosaurus " remains of the dry island bonebed , the bones of the small theropod " albertonykus " were found .
adult " albertosaurus " were the apex predators in this environment , with intermediate niches possibly filled by juvenile albertosaurs .
british rail british railways ( br ) , which from *num* traded as british rail , was the state-owned company that operated most of the overground rail transport in great britain between *num* and *num* .
it was formed from the nationalisation of the " big four " british railway companies and lasted until the gradual privatisation of british rail , in stages between *num* and *num* .
originally a trading brand of the railway executive of the british transport commission , it became an independent statutory corporation in *num* designated as the british railways board .
the period of nationalisation saw sweeping changes in the national railway network .
a process of dieselisation and electrification took place , and by *num* steam locomotion had been entirely replaced by diesel and electric traction , except for one narrow-gauge tourist line the vale of rheidol railway .
passengers replaced freight as the main source of business , and one third of the network was closed by the beeching axe of the 1960s in an effort to reduce rail subsidies .
on privatisation , responsibility for track , signalling and stations was transferred to railtrack ( which was later brought under public control as network rail ) and that for trains to the train operating companies .
the british rail " double arrow " logo is formed of two interlocked arrows showing the direction of travel on a double track railway and was nicknamed " the arrow of indecision " .
it is now employed as a generic symbol on street signs in great britain denoting railway stations , and as part of the rail delivery group's ( rdg ) jointly-managed national rail brand is still printed on railway tickets .
the rail transport system in great britain developed during the *ord* century .
after the grouping of *num* under the railways act *num* , there were four large railway companies , each dominating its own geographic area : the great western railway ( gwr ) , the london , midland and scottish railway ( lms ) , the london and north eastern railway ( lner ) and the southern railway ( sr ) .
during world war i the railways were under state control , which continued until *num* .
complete nationalisation had been considered , and the railways act *num* is sometimes considered as a precursor to that , but the concept was rejected .
nationalisation was subsequently carried out after world war ii , under the transport act *num* .
this act made provision for the nationalisation of the network , as part of a policy of nationalising public services by clement attlee's labour government .
british railways came into existence as the business name of the railway executive of the british transport commission ( btc ) on *num* january *num* when it took over the assets of the big four .
there were also joint railways between the big four and a few light railways to consider ( see list of constituents of british railways ) .
excluded from nationalisation were industrial lines like the oxfordshire ironstone railway .
the london underground – publicly owned since *num* – was also nationalised , becoming the london transport executive of the british transport commission .
the bicester military railway was already run by the government .
the electric liverpool overhead railway was also excluded from nationalisation .
the railway executive was conscious that some lines on the ( then very dense ) network were unprofitable and hard to justify socially , and a programme of closures began almost immediately after nationalisation .
however , the general financial position of br became gradually poorer , until an operating loss was recorded in *num* .
the executive itself had been abolished in *num* by the conservative government , and control of br transferred to the parent commission .
other changes to the british transport commission at the same time included the return of road haulage to the private sector .
british railways was divided into regions which were initially based on the areas the former big four operated in ; later , several lines were transferred between regions .
notably , these included the former great central lines from the eastern region to the london midland region , and the west of england main line from the southern region to western region the north eastern region was merged with the eastern region in *num* .
in the 1980s , the regions were abolished and replaced by " business sectors " , a process known as sectorisation .
the anglia region was created in late *num* , its first general manager being john edmonds , who began his appointment on *num* october *num* .
full separation from the eastern region – apart from engineering design needs – occurred on *num* april *num* .
it handled the services from and , its western boundary being , and .
the report , latterly known as the " modernisation plan " , was published in january *num* .
it was intended to bring the railway system into the *ord* century .
a government white paper produced in *num* stated that modernisation would help eliminate br's financial deficit by *num* , but the figures in both this and the original plan were produced for political reasons and not based on detailed analysis .
the aim was to increase speed , reliability , safety , and line capacity through a series of measures that would make services more attractive to passengers and freight operators , thus recovering traffic lost to the roads .
important areas included : the government appeared to endorse the *num* programme ( costing £1 .
*num* billion ) , but did so largely for political reasons .
this included the withdrawal of steam traction and its replacement by diesel ( and some electric ) locomotives .
not all the modernisations would be effective at reducing costs .
the dieselisation programme gave contracts primarily to british suppliers , who had limited experience of diesel locomotive manufacture , and rushed commissioning based on an expectation of rapid electrification ; this resulted in numbers of locomotives with poor designs , and a lack of standardisation .
at the same time , containerised freight was being developed .
the marshalling yard building programme was a failure , being based on a belief in the continued viability of wagon-load traffic in the face of increasingly effective road competition , and lacking effective forward planning or realistic assessments of future freight .
a *num* documentary broadcast on bbc radio four blamed the 1950s decisions for the " beleaguered " condition of the railway system at that time .
during the late 1950s , railway finances continued to worsen , whilst passenger numbers grew after restoring many services reduced during the war , and in *num* the government stepped in , limiting the amount the btc could spend without ministerial authority .
a white paper proposing reorganisation was published in the following year , and a new structure was brought into effect by the transport act *num* .
this abolished the commission and replaced it by several separate boards .
these included a british railways board , which took over on *num* january *num* .
following semi-secret discussions on railway finances by the government-appointed stedeford committee in *num* , one of its members , dr richard beeching , was offered the post of chairing the btc while it lasted , and then becoming the first chairman of the british railways board .
a major traffic census in april *num* , which lasted one week , was used in the compilation of a report on the future of the network .
this report—"the reshaping of british railways"—was published by the brb in march *num* .
the proposals , which became known as the " beeching axe " , were dramatic .
a third of all passenger services and more than *num* , *num* of the *num* , *num* stations would close .
beeching , who is thought to have been the author of most of the report , set out some dire figures .
one third of the network was carrying just *num* % of the traffic .
of the *num* , *num* passenger coaches , *num* , *num* were said to be used only *num* times a year or less .
although maintaining them cost between £3m and £4m a year , they earned only about £0 .
5m .
most of the closures were carried out between *num* and *num* ( including some which were not listed in the report ) while other suggested closures were not carried out .
the closures were heavily criticised at the time , and continue to be controversial .
a small number of stations and lines closed under the beeching programme have been reopened , with further reopenings proposed .
a second beeching report , " the development of the major trunk routes " , followed in *num* .
this did not recommend closures as such , but outlined a " network for development " .
the fate of the rest of the network was not discussed in the report .
the basis for calculating passenger fares changed in *num* .
in future , fares on some routes—such as rural , holiday and commuter services—would be set at a higher level than on other routes ; previously , fares had been calculated using a simple rate for the distance travelled , which at the time was 3d per mile second class , and 4½d per mile first class ( equivalent to £ and £ respectively , in ) .
passenger levels decreased steadily from *num* to the late 1970s , and reached a low in *num* .
network improvements included completing electrification of the great eastern main line from london to norwich between *num* and *num* and the east coast main line from london to edinburgh between *num* and *num* .
a main line route closure during this period of relative network stability was the *num* v dc-electrified woodhead line between manchester and sheffield : passenger service ceased in *num* and goods in *num* .
the 1980s and 1990s saw the closure of some railways which had survived the beeching axe a generation earlier , but which had seen passenger services withdrawn .
this included the bulk of the chester and connah's quay railway in *num* , the brierley hill to walsall section of the south staffordshire line in *num* , while the birmingham to wolverhampton section of the great western railway was closed in three phases between *num* and *num* .
a further british rail report , from a committee chaired by sir david serpell , was published in *num* .
the serpell report made no recommendations as such , but did set out various options for the network including , at their most extreme , a skeletal system of less than *num* route km .
this report was not welcomed , and the government decided to quietly leave it on the shelf .
meanwhile , br was gradually reorganised , with the regional structure finally being abolished and replaced with business-led sectors .
this process , known as " sectorisation " , led to far greater customer focus , but was cut short in *num* with the splitting up of br for privatisation .
upon sectorisation in *num* , three passenger sectors were created : intercity , operating principal express services ; london & south east ( renamed network southeast in *num* ) operating commuter services in the london area ; and provincial ( renamed regional railways in *num* ) responsible for all other passenger services .
in the metropolitan counties local services were managed by the passenger transport executives .
provincial was the most subsidised ( per passenger km ) of the three sectors ; upon formation , its costs were four times its revenue .
because british railways was such a large operation , running not just railways but also ferries , steamships and hotels , it has been considered difficult to analyse the effects of nationalisation .
during the 1980s british rail ran the rail riders membership club aimed at 5- to 15-year-olds .
prices rose quickly in this period , rising *num* % in real terms from *num* to *num* , as prices rose by *num* % but rpi only increased by *num* % in the same time .
following nationalisation in *num* , british railways began to adapt the corporate liveries on the rolling stock it had inherited from its predecessor railway companies .
initially , a gwr-style brunswick green was used on passenger locomotives , and lnwr-style lined black for mixed-traffic locomotives , but later green was more widely adopted .
development of a corporate identity for the organisation was hampered by the competing ambitions of the british transport commission and the railway executive .
the executive attempted to introduce a modern , curved logo which could also serve as the standard for station signage totems .
due to its similarity to a hot dog , it became known as the " flying sausage " .
br eventually adopted the common branding of the btc as its first corporate logo , an art deco-style motif of a lion astride a spoked wheel , designed for the btc by cecil thomas ; on the bar overlaid across the wheel , the btc's name was replaced with the words " british railways " .
this logo , nicknamed the " cycling lion " , was applied from *num* to *num* to the sides of locomotives , while the sausage logo was adopted for station signs across great britain , each coloured according to the appropriate br region .
in *num* , the btc was granted a heraldic achievement by the college of arms and the lord lyon , and then btc chairman brian robertson wanted a grander logo for the railways .
br's second corporate logo ( 1956–1965 ) , designed in consultation with charles franklyn , adapted the original , depicting a rampant lion emerging from a heraldic crown and holding a spoked wheel , all enclosed in a roundel with the " british railways " name displayed across a bar on either side .
this emblem soon acquired the nickname of the " ferret and dartboard " .
a variant of the logo with the name in a circle was also used on locomotives .
the zeal for modernisation in the beeching era drove the next rebranding exercise , and br management wished to divest the organisation of anachronistic , heraldic motifs and develop a corporate identity to rival that of london transport .
br's design panel set up a working party led by milner gray of the design research unit .
they drew up a corporate identity manual which established a coherent brand and design standard for the whole organisation , specifying rail blue and pearl grey as the standard colour scheme for all rolling stock ; rail alphabet as the standard corporate typeface , designed by jock kinneir and margaret calvert ; and introducing the now-iconic corporate identity symbol of the " double arrow " logo .
designed by gerald barney ( also of the dru ) , this arrow device was formed of two interlocked arrows across two parallel lines , symbolising a double track railway .
it was likened to a bolt of lightning or barbed wire , and also acquired a nickname : " the arrow of indecision " .
a mirror image of the double arrow was used on the port side of br-owned sealink ferry funnels .
the new br corporate identity and double arrow were rolled out in *num* , and the brand name of the organisation was truncated to " british rail " .
the uniformity of br branding continued until the process of sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s .
certain br operations such as inter-city , network southeast or railfreight began to adopt their own identities , introducing logos and colour schemes which were essentially variants of the british rail brand .
eventually , as sectorisation developed into a prelude to privatisation , the unified british rail brand disappeared , with the notable exception of the double arrow symbol , which has survived to this day and serves as a generic trademark to denote railway services across great britain .
the br corporate identity manual is noted as a piece of british design history and there are plans for it to be re-published .
despite its nationalisation in *num* " as one of the ' commanding heights ' of the economy " , according to some sources british rail was not profitable for most ( if not all ) of its history .
newspapers reported that as recently as the 1990s , public rail subsidy was counted as profit ; as early as *num* , british railways were losing £300 , *num* a day .
it was thought that most of the nationalised railways ( excluding some freight services ) would cease to operate like other unprofitable privatised businesses in the uk , and british rail's profitability was questioned .
although the company was considered the sole public-transport option in many rural areas , the beeching cuts made buses the only public transport available in some rural areas .
despite increases in traffic congestion and automotive fuel prices beginning to rise in the 1990s , british rail remained unprofitable .
following sectorisation , intercity became profitable .
this sector became the first long distance passenger railway in the uk to go into profit .
intercity became one of britain's top *num* companies with civilised city centre to city centre travel across the nation from aberdeen and inverness in the north to poole and penzance in the south .
in *num* the incoming conservative government led by margaret thatcher was viewed as anti-railway , and did not want to commit public money to the railways .
however , british rail was allowed to spend its own money with government approval .
this led to a number of electrification projects being given the go-ahead , including the east coast main line , the spur from doncaster to leeds , and the lines in east anglia out of london liverpool street to norwich and king's lynn .
the list with approximate completion dates includes : in the southwest , the line from bournemouth to weymouth was electrified along with other infill *num* v dc *ord* rail electrification in the south .
in *num* , the line to aberdare was reopened .
a british rail advertisement ( " britain's railway " , directed by hugh hudson ) featured some of the best known railway structures in britain , including the forth rail bridge , royal albert bridge , glenfinnan viaduct and london paddington station .
london liverpool street station was rebuilt , opened by queen elizabeth ii , and a new station was constructed at stansted airport in *num* .
the following year , the maesteg line was reopened .
in *num* , the windsor link line , greater manchester was constructed and has proven to be an important piece of infrastructure .
between *num* and *num* , british rail was privatised .
ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to railtrack on *num* april *num* .
passenger operations were later franchised to *num* private-sector operators and the freight services were sold to six companies , five of whom were owned by the same buyer .
the waterloo & city line , part of br network southeast , was not included in the privatisation and was transferred to london underground in december *num* .
the remaining obligations of british rail were transferred to brb ( residuary ) limited .
the privatisation , proposed by the conservative government in *num* , was opposed by the labour party and the rail unions .
although labour initially proposed to reverse privatisation , the new labour manifesto of *num* instead opposed conservative plans to privatise the london underground .
rail unions have historically opposed privatisation , but former associated society of locomotive engineers and firemen general secretary lew adams moved to work for virgin trains , and said on a *num* radio phone-in programme : " all the time it was in the public sector , all we got were cuts , cuts , cuts .
and today there are more members in the trade union , more train drivers , and more trains running .
the reality is that it worked , we’ve protected jobs , and we got more jobs .
" the former br network , with the trunk routes of the west coast main line , east coast main line , great western main line , great eastern main line and midland main line , remains mostly unchanged since privatisation .
several lines have reopened and more are proposed , particularly in scotland and wales where the control of railway passenger services is devolved from central government .
however , in england passenger trains have returned to mansfield , corby , chandlers ford , the reopened line to aylesbury vale parkway and there are numerous other proposals to restore services , such as oxford-milton keynes / aylesbury , lewes-uckfield , bristol-portishead and plymouth-tavistock .
in london , tyne and wear , greater manchester , the west midlands and nottingham urban light-rail systems have taken over the routes of some former br routes .
in wales , the welsh assembly government successfully supported the reopening to passenger services , of the vale of glamorgan line between barry and bridgend in *num* .
in *num* the ebbw valley railway reopened between ebbw vale parkway and cardiff , with services to newport scheduled to commence by *num* .
( the barry-bridgend route was included in the closures proposed in the beeching report of march *num* and its services were duly withdrawn in june *num* , but ebbw vale had already been closed to passengers before the report was published .
) in scotland , the scottish government have reinstated the lines between hamilton and larkhall , stirling and alloa , and airdrie to bathgate .
the biggest line reinstatement project was the rebuilding of part of the former waverley route from edinburgh to carlisle as the borders railway .
the narrow-gauge vale of rheidol railway in ceredigion , wales became part of british railways at nationalisation .
although built as a working railway , in *num* the line was principally a tourist attraction .
british rail operated the line using steam locomotives , long after the withdrawal of standard-gauge steam .
the line's three steam locomotives were the only ones to receive tops serial numbers and be painted in br rail blue livery with the double arrow logo .
the vale of rheidol railway was privatised in *num* and continues to operate as a private heritage railway .
other preserved lines , or heritage railways , have reopened lines previously closed by british rail .
these range from picturesque rural branch lines like the keighley and worth valley railway to sections of mainline such as the great central railway .
many have links to the national rail network , both at station interchanges , for example the severn valley railway between and kidderminster town , and physical rail connections like the watercress line at .
although most are operated solely as leisure amenities some also provide educational resources , and a few have ambitions to restore commercial services over routes abandoned by the nationalised industry .
british railways operated ships from its formation in *num* on several routes .
many ships were acquired on nationalisation , and others were built for operation by british railways or its later subsidiary , sealink .
those ships capable of carrying rail vehicles were classed under tops as class *num* .
sealink was a ferry company based in the united kingdom from *num* to *num* , operating services to france , belgium , the netherlands , channel islands , isle of wight and ireland .
the joint hovercraft services of british rail ( under british rail hovercraft limited ) in association with the french sncf .
british rail hovercraft limited was established in *num* , under authority given to it by the british railways act *num* and started its first service in *num* .
seaspeed started cross-channel services from dover , england to calais and boulogne-sur-mer , france using sr-n4 hovercraft in august *num* .
a family of railway carriages , designed and built by british rail workshops ( from *num* british rail engineering limited ) ( brel ) between *num* and *num* .
they were of steel construction .
many remain in service to this day .
the advanced passenger train ( apt ) was an experimental tilting high speed train developed by british rail during the 1970s and early 1980s , for use on the west coast main line , which contained a lot of curves .
notable among numerous technical advancements was the active tilting system , which the apt pioneered and has since appeared on other designs around the world .
the intercity *num* was and is a high speed diesel train that is widely credited with saving british rail and is usually called hst .
it was introduced by british rail in the early 1970s .
under the process of british rail's privatisation , operations were split into more than *num* companies .
the ownership and operation of the infrastructure of the railway system was taken over by railtrack .
the telecomms infrastructure and british rail telecommunications was sold to racal , which in turn was sold to global crossing and merged with thales group .
the rolling stock was transferred to three private roscos ( rolling stock companies ) .
passenger services were divided into *num* operating companies , which were let on a franchise basis for a set period , whilst goods services were sold off completely .
dozens of smaller engineering and maintenance companies were also created and sold off .
british rail's passenger services came to an end upon the franchising of scotrail ; the final train that the company operated was a railfreight distribution goods train in autumn *num* .
the british railways board continued in existence as a corporation until early *num* , when it was replaced with the strategic rail authority .
since privatisation , the structure of the rail industry and number of companies has changed several times as franchises have been re-let and the areas covered by franchises restructured .
franchise-based companies that took over passenger rail services include : since privatisation , many groups have campaigned for the renationalisation of british rail , most notably ' bring back british rail ' .
various interested parties also have views on the privatisation of british rail .
the renationalisation of the railways of britain continues to have popular support .
polls in *num* and *num* showed *num* % and *num* % support for renationalisation respectively .
due to rail franchises lasting sometimes over a decade , full renationalisation would take years unless compensation was paid to terminate contracts early .
when the infrastructure owning company railtrack ceased trading in *num* , the labour government set up the not-for-dividend company network rail to take over the duties rather than renationalise this part of the network .
however , in september *num* , network rail was reclassified as a central government body , adding around £34 billion to public sector net debt .
this reclassification had been requested by the office for budget responsibility to comply with pan-european accounting standard esa10 .
under jeremy corbyn , the labour party has pledged to gradually renationalise british rail franchises if elected , as and when their private contracts expire , creating a " people's railway " .
in *num* , the itv sketch show " spitting image " made a parody of hudson's " british rail " advert on the plans of the conservative british government to privatise the railways featuring many of the show's puppets ( including the show's portrayal of former prime minister margaret thatcher ) , numerous br trains and landmarks and even a cardboard cutout of thomas the tank engine .
alessandro algardi alessandro algardi ( november *num* , *num* – june *num* , *num* ) was an italian high-baroque sculptor active almost exclusively in rome , where for the latter decades of his life , he was , along with francesco borromini and pietro da cortona , one of the major rivals of gian lorenzo bernini .
algardi was born in bologna , where at a young age , he was apprenticed in the studio of agostino carracci .
however , his aptitude for sculpture led him to work for giulio cesare conventi ( 1577–1640 ) , an artist of modest talents .
his two earliest known works date back to this period : two statues of saints , made of chalk , in the oratory of santa maria della vita in bologna .
by the age of twenty , ferdinando i , duke of mantua , began commissioning works from him , and he was also employed by local jewelers for figurative designs .
after a short residence in venice , he went to rome in *num* with an introduction from the duke of mantua to the late pope's nephew , cardinal ludovico ludovisi , who employed him for a time in the restoration of ancient statues .
propelled by the borghese and barberini patronage , gian lorenzo bernini and his studio garnered most of the major roman sculptural commissions .
for nearly a decade , algardi struggled for recognition .
in rome he was aided by friends that included pietro da cortona and his fellow bolognese , domenichino .
his early roman commissions included terracotta and some marble portrait busts , while he supported himself with small works like crucifixes .
in the 1630s he worked on the tombs of the mellini family in the mellini chapel in santa maria del popolo .
algardi's first major commission came about in *num* , when cardinal ubaldini ( medici ) contracted for a funeral monument for his great-uncle , pope leo xi , the third of the medici popes , who had reigned for less than a month in *num* .
the monument was started in *num* , and mostly completed by *num* .
the arrangement mirrors the one designed by bernini for the tomb of urban viii ( 1628–47 ) , with a central hieratic sculpture of the pope seated in full regalia and offering a hand of blessing , while at his feet , two allegorical female figures flank his sarcophagus .
however , in bernini's tomb , the vigorous upraised arm and posture of the pope is counterbalanced by an active drama below , wherein the figures of " charity " and " justice " are either distracted by " putti " or lost in contemplation , while skeletal " death " actively writes the epitaph .
algardi's tomb is much less dynamic .
the allegorical figures of " magnanimity " and " liberality " have an impassive , ethereal dignity .
some have identified the helmeted figure of " magnanimity " with that of athena and iconic images of " wisdom " .
" liberality " resembles duquesnoy's famous " santa susanna " , but rendered more elegant .
the tomb is somberly monotone and lacks the polychromatic excitement that detracts from the elegiac mood of urban viii's tomb .
in 1635–38 , pietro boncompagni commissioned from algardi a colossal statue of philip neri with kneeling angels for santa maria in vallicella , completed in *num* .
immediately after this , algardi produced an interactive sculptural group representing the beheading of saint paul with two figures : a kneeling , resigned saint and the executioner poised to strike the sword-blow , for the church of san paolo , bologna .
these works established his reputation .
like bernini's characteristic works , they often express the baroque aesthetic of depicting dramatic attitudes and emotional expressions , yet algardi's sculpture has a restraining sobriety in contrast to those of his rival .
with the death of the barberini pope urban viii in *num* and the accession of the pamphilj pope innocent x , the barberini family and fell into disrepute , resulting in fewer commissions for bernini .
algardi , on the other hand , was embraced by the new pope and the pope's nephew , camillo pamphilj .
algardi's portraits were highly prized , and their formal severity contrasts with bernini's more vivacious expression .
a large hieratic bronze of innocent x by algardi is now to be found in the capitoline museums .
algardi was not renowned for his architectural abilities .
although he was in charge of the project for the papal villa , the villa pamphili , now villa doria pamphili , outside the porta san pancrazio in rome , he may have had professional guidance on the design of the casino from the architect / engineer girolamo rainaldi and help with supervising its construction from his assistant giovanni francesco grimaldi .
the casino was a showcase for the pamphili collection of sculpture , ancient and contemporary , on which algardi was well able to advise .
in the villa grounds , algardi and his studio executed sculpture-encrusted fountains and other garden features , where some of his free-standing sculpture and bas-reliefs remain .
in *num* algardi met diego velázquez , who obtained commissions for his work from spain .
as a consequence there are four chimney-pieces by algardi in the royal palace of aranjuez , and in the gardens , the figures on the fountain of neptune are also by him .
the augustinian monastery at salamanca contains the tomb of the count and countess de monterey , another work by algardi .
algardi's large dramatic marble high-relief panel of pope leo and attila ( 1646–53 ) for st peter's basilica , and reinvigorated the use of such marble reliefs .
there had been large marble reliefs used previously in roman churches , but for most patrons , sculpted marble altarpieces were far too costly .
in this relief , the two principal figures , the stern and courageous pope and the dismayed and frightened attila , surge forward from the center into three dimensions .
only they two see the descending angelic warriors rallying to the pope's defense , while all others in the background reliefs , persist in performing their respective earthly duties .
the subject was apt for a papal state seeking clout , since it depicts the historical legend when the greatest of the popes leo , with supernatural aid , deterred the huns from looting rome .
from a baroque standpoint it is a moment of divine intervention in the affairs of man .
no doubt part of his patron's message would be that all viewers would be sternly reminded of the papal capacity to invoke divine retribution against enemies .
algardi died in rome within a year of completing his famous relief , which was admired by contemporaries .
in his later years algardi controlled a large studio and amassed a great fortune .
algardi's classicizing manner was carried on by pupils ( including ercole ferrata and domenico guidi ) .
antonio raggi initially trained with him .
the latter two completed his design for an altarpiece of the " vision of saint nicholas " ( san nicola da tolentino , rome ) using two separate marble pieces linked together in one event and place , yet successfully separating the divine and earthly spheres .
other lesser known assistants from his studio include francesco barrata , girolamo lucenti , and giuseppe peroni .
algardi was also known for his portraiture which shows an obsessive attention to details of psychologically revealing physiognomy in a sober but immediate naturalism , and minute attention to costume and draperies , such as in the busts of laudivio zacchia , camillo pamphilj , and of muzio frangipane and his two sons lello and roberto .
in temperament , his style was more akin to the classicized and restrained baroque of duquesnoy than to the emotive works of other baroque artists .
from an artistic point of view , he was most successful in portrait-statues and groups of children , where he was obliged to follow nature most closely .
his terracotta models , some of them finished works of art , were prized by collectors .
an outstanding series of terracotta models is at the hermitage museum , saint petersburg .
monaco grand prix the monaco grand prix ( ) is a formula one motor race held each year on the circuit de monaco .
run since *num* , it is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world and , with the indianapolis *num* and the *num* hours of le mans , forms the triple crown of motorsport .
the circuit has been called " an exceptional location of glamour and prestige " .
the race is held on a narrow course laid out in the streets of monaco , with many elevation changes and tight corners as well as a tunnel , making it one of the most demanding tracks in formula one .
in spite of the relatively low average speeds , the monaco circuit is a dangerous place to race and often involves the intervention of a safety car .
thus , it is the only grand prix that does not adhere to the fia's mandated minimum race distance for f1 races .
the monaco grand prix was part of the pre-second world war european championship and was included in the first world championship of drivers in *num* .
it was designated the european grand prix two times , *num* and *num* , when this title was an honorary designation given each year to one grand prix race in europe .
graham hill was known as " "mr .
monaco" " due to his five monaco wins in the 1960s .
brazil's ayrton senna won the race more times than any other driver , with six victories , winning five races consecutively between *num* and *num* .
in *num* , lewis hamilton and fernando alonso criticised monaco gp as the " most boring race " due to limited opportunities of overtaking during the grand prix .
like many european races , the monaco grand prix predates the current world championship .
the principality's first grand prix was organised in *num* by antony noghès , under the auspices of prince louis ii , through the automobile club de monaco ( acm ) , of which he was president .
the acm organised the rallye automobile monte carlo , and in *num* applied to the " association internationale des automobiles clubs reconnus " ( aiacr ) , the international governing body of motorsport , to be upgraded from a regional french club to full national status .
their application was refused due to the lack of a major motorsport event held wholly within monaco's boundaries .
the rally could not be considered as it mostly used the roads of other european countries .
to attain full national status , noghès proposed the creation of an automobile grand prix in the streets of monte carlo .
he obtained the official sanction of prince louis ii , and the support of monegasque " grand prix " driver louis chiron .
chiron thought monaco's topography well-suited to setting up a race track .
the first race , held on *num* april *num* , was won by william grover-williams ( using the pseudonym " williams " ) , driving a works bugatti type 35b .
it was an invitation-only event , but not all of those invited decided to attend .
the leading maserati and alfa romeo drivers decided not to compete , but bugatti was well represented .
mercedes sent their leading driver , rudolf caracciola .
starting fifteenth , caracciola drove a fighting race , taking his ssk into the lead before wasting *num* minutes on refuelling and a tyre change to finish second .
another driver who competed using a pseudonym was " georges philippe " , the baron philippe de rothschild .
chiron was unable to compete , having a prior commitment to compete in the indianapolis *num* on the same day .
caracciola's ssk was refused permission to race the following year , but chiron did compete ( in the works bugatti type 35c ) , when he was beaten by privateer rené dreyfus and his bugatti type 35b , and finished second .
chiron took victory in the *num* race driving a bugatti .
, he remains the only native of monaco to have won the event .
the race quickly grew in importance after its inception .
because of the high number of races which were being termed ' grands prix ' , the aiacr formally recognised the most important race of each of its affiliated national automobile clubs as international grands prix , or " grandes épreuves " , and in *num* monaco was ranked as such alongside the french , belgian , italian , and spanish grands prix .
that year's race was the first grand prix in which grid positions were decided , as they are now , by practice time rather than the established method of balloting .
the race saw achille varzi and tazio nuvolari exchange the lead many times before the race being settled in varzi's favour on the final lap when nuvolari's car caught fire .
the race became a round of the new european championship in *num* , when stormy weather and a broken oil line led to a series of crashes , eliminating the mercedes-benzes of chiron , fagioli , and von brauchitsch , as well as bernd rosemeyer's " typ c " for newcomer auto union ; rudolf caracciola , proving the truth of his nickname , " regenmeister " ( rainmaster ) , went on to win .
in *num* , von brauchitsch duelled caracciola before coming out on top .
it was the last prewar " grand prix " at monaco , for in *num* , the demand for £500 ( about us$2450 ) in appearance money per top entrant led aiacr to cancel the event , while looming war overtook it in *num* , and the second world war ended organised racing in europe until *num* .
racing in europe started again on *num* september *num* at the bois de boulogne park in the city of paris , four months and one day after the end of the war in europe .
however , the monaco grand prix was not run between *num* and *num* due to financial reasons .
in *num* a new premier racing category , grand prix , was defined by the fédération internationale de l'automobile ( fia ) , the successor of the aiacr , based on the pre-war voiturette class .
a monaco grand prix was run to this formula in *num* , won by the future world champion nino farina in a maserati 4clt .
the *num* event was cancelled due to the death of prince louis ii ; it was included in the new formula one world drivers ' championship the following year .
the race provided future five-time world champion juan manuel fangio with his first win in a world championship race , as well as third place for the 51-year-old louis chiron , his best result in the world championship era .
however , there was no race in *num* .
in *num* , the first of the two years in which the world drivers ' championship was run to less powerful formula two regulations , the race was run to sports car rules instead , and it did not form part of the world championship .
no races were held in *num* or *num* .
since *num* , the monaco grand prix has continuously been part of the formula one world championship .
that year , maurice trintignant won in monte carlo for the first time and chiron again scored points and at *num* became the oldest driver to compete in a formula one grand prix .
it was not until *num* , when fangio won again , that the grand prix saw a double winner .
between *num* and *num* fangio's former mercedes colleague , stirling moss , went one better , as did trintignant , who won the race again in *num* driving a cooper .
the *num* race saw moss fend off three works ferrari 156s in a year-old privateer rob walker racing team lotus *num* , to take his third monaco victory .
britain's graham hill won the race five times in the 1960s and became known as " "king of monaco" " and " "mr .
monaco" " .
he first won in *num* , and then won the next two years .
in the *num* race he took pole position and led from the start , but went up an escape road on lap *num* to avoid hitting a slow backmarker .
re-joining in fifth place , hill set several new lap records on the way to winning .
the race was also notable for jim clark's absence ( he was doing the indianapolis *num* ) , and for paul hawkins's lotus ending up in the harbour .
hill's teammate , briton jackie stewart , won in *num* and new zealander denny hulme won in *num* , but hill won the next two years , the *num* event being his final formula one championship victory , by which time he was a double formula one world champion .
by the start of the 1970s , efforts by jackie stewart saw several formula one events cancelled because of safety concerns .
for the *num* event , armco barriers were placed at specific points for the first time in the circuit's history .
before that , the circuit's conditions were ( aside from the removal of people's production cars parked on the side of the road ) virtually identical to everyday road use .
if a driver went off , he had a chance to crash into whatever was next to the track ( buildings , trees , lamp posts , glass windows , and even a train station ) , and in alberto ascari's and paul hawkins's cases , the harbour water , because the concrete road the course used had no armco to protect the drivers from going off the track and into the mediterranean .
the circuit gained more armco in specific points for the next two races , and by *num* , the circuit was almost completely armco-lined .
for the first time in its history , the monaco circuit was altered in *num* as the pits were moved next to the waterfront straight between the chicane and tabac and the chicane was moved further forward right before tabac becoming the junction point between the pits and the course .
the course was changed again for the *num* race .
the rainier iii nautical stadium was constructed where the straight that went behind the pits was and the circuit introduced a double chicane that went around the new swimming pool ( this chicane complex is known today as " swimming pool " ) .
this created space for a whole new pit facility and in *num* the course was altered yet again ; the sainte devote corner was made slower and a chicane was placed right before the pit straight .
by the early 1970s , as brabham team owner bernie ecclestone started to marshal the collective bargaining power of the formula one constructors association ( foca ) , monaco was prestigious enough to become an early bone of contention .
historically the number of cars permitted in a race was decided by the race organiser , in this case the acm , which had always set a low number of around *num* .
in *num* ecclestone started to negotiate deals which relied on foca guaranteeing at least *num* entrants for every race .
a stand-off over this issue left the *num* race in jeopardy until the acm gave in and agreed that *num* cars could participate – the same number permitted at most other circuits .
two years later , in *num* , the acm got the numbers back down to *num* .
because of its tight confines , slow average speeds and punishing nature , monaco has often thrown up unexpected results .
in the *num* race rené arnoux led the first *num* laps , before retiring .
alain prost then led until four laps from the end , when he spun off on the wet track , hit the barriers and lost a wheel , giving riccardo patrese the lead .
patrese himself spun with only a lap and a half to go , letting didier pironi through to the front , followed by andrea de cesaris .
on the last lap , pironi ran out of fuel in the tunnel , but de cesaris also ran out of fuel before he could overtake .
in the meantime , patrese had bump-started his car and went through to score his first grand prix win .
in *num* the acm became entangled in the disagreements between fédération internationale du sport automobile ( fisa ) and foca .
the acm , with the agreement of bernie ecclestone , negotiated an individual television rights deal with abc in the united states .
this broke an agreement enforced by fisa for a single central negotiation of television rights .
jean-marie balestre , president of fisa , announced that the monaco grand prix would not form part of the formula one world championship in *num* .
the acm fought their case in the french courts .
they won the case and the race was eventually reinstated .
for the decade from *num* to *num* the race was won by only two drivers , arguably the two best drivers in formula one at the time–frenchman prost and brazilian ayrton senna .
prost , already a winner of the support race for formula three cars in *num* , took his first monaco win at the *num* race .
the race started *num* minutes late after heavy rain .
prost led briefly before nigel mansell overtook him on lap *num* .
mansell crashed out five laps later , letting prost back into the lead .
on lap *num* , prost led from ayrton senna's toleman and stefan bellof's tyrrell .
senna was catching prost and bellof was catching both of them in the only naturally aspirated car in the race .
however , on lap *num* , the race was controversially stopped with conditions deemed to be undriveable .
later , fisa fined the clerk of the course , jacky ickx , $6 , *num* and suspended his licence for not consulting the stewards before stopping the race .
the drivers received only half of the points that would usually be awarded , as the race had been stopped before two-thirds of the intended race distance had been completed .
prost won *num* after polesitter senna retired with a blown renault engine in his lotus after over-revving it at the start , and michele alboreto in the ferrari retook the lead twice , but he went off the track at sainte-devote , where brazilian nelson piquet and italian riccardo patrese had a huge accident only a few laps previously and oil and debris littered the track .
prost passed alboreto , who retook the frenchman , and then he punctured a tyre after running over bodywork debris from the piquet / patrese accident , which dropped him to *ord* .
he was able to pass his roman countrymen andrea de cesaris and elio de angelis , but finished *ord* behind prost .
the french prost dominated *num* after starting from pole position , a race where the nouvelle chicane had been changed on the grounds of safety .
senna holds the record for the most victories in monaco , with six , including five consecutive wins between *num* and *num* , as well as eight podium finishes in ten starts .
his *num* win was the first time a car with an active suspension had won a grand prix .
he won this race after briton nigel mansell in a williams-honda went out with a broken exhaust .
his win was very popular with the people of monaco , and when he was arrested on the monday following the race , for riding a motorcycle without wearing a helmet , he was released by the officers after they realised who he was .
senna dominated *num* , and was able to get ahead of his teammate prost while the frenchman was held up for most of the race by austrian gerhard berger in a ferrari .
by the time prost got past berger , he pushed as hard as he could and set a lap some *num* seconds faster than senna's ; senna then set *num* fastest laps , and while pushing as hard as possible , he touched the barrier at the portier corner and crashed into the armco separating the road from the mediterranean .
senna was so upset that he went back to his monaco flat and was not heard from until the evening .
prost went on to win for the fourth time .
senna dominated *num* while prost was stuck behind backmarker rene arnoux and others ; the brazilian also dominated *num* and *num* .
at the *num* event nigel mansell , who had won all five races held to that point in the season , took pole and dominated the race in his williams fw14b-renault .
however , with seven laps remaining , mansell suffered a loose wheel nut and was forced into the pits , emerging behind ayrton senna's mclaren-honda , who was on worn tyres .
mansell , on fresh tyres , set a lap record almost two seconds quicker than senna's and closed from *num* .
*num* to *num* .
*num* seconds in only two laps .
the pair duelled around monaco for the final four laps but mansell could find no way past , finishing just two-tenths of a second behind the brazilian .
it was senna's fifth win at monaco , equalling graham hill's record .
senna had a poor start to the *num* event , crashing in practice and qualifying *ord* behind pole-sitter prost and the rising german star michael schumacher .
both of them beat senna to the first corner , but prost had to serve a time penalty for jumping the start and schumacher retired with hydraulic active suspension problems , so senna took his sixth win to break graham hill's record for most wins at the monaco grand prix .
runner-up damon hill commented , " if my father was around now , he would be the first to congratulate ayrton .
" the *num* race was an emotional and tragic affair .
it came two weeks after the race at imola in which austrian roland ratzenberger and ayrton senna both died from massive head injuries from on-track accidents on successive days .
during the monaco event , austrian karl wendlinger had an accident in his sauber in the tunnel ; he went into a coma and was to miss the rest of the season .
the german michael schumacher won the *num* monaco event .
the *num* race saw michael schumacher take pole position before crashing out on the first lap after being overtaken by damon hill .
hill led the first *num* laps before his engine expired in the tunnel .
jean alesi took the lead but suffered suspension failure *num* laps later .
olivier panis , who started in *ord* place , moved into the lead and stayed there until the end of the race , being pushed all the way by david coulthard .
it was panis's only win , and the last for his ligier team .
only three cars crossed the finish line , but seven were classified .
seven-time world champion schumacher would eventually win the race five times , matching graham hill's record .
in his appearance at the *num* event , he attracted criticism when , while provisionally holding pole position and with the qualifying session drawing to a close , he stopped his car at the rascasse hairpin , blocking the track and obliging competitors to slow down .
although schumacher claimed it was the unintentional result of a genuine car failure , the fia disagreed and he was sent to the back of the grid .
in july *num* , bernie ecclestone announced that a 10-year deal had been reached with the race organisers , keeping the race on the calendar until at least *num* .
the circuit de monaco consists of the city streets of monte carlo and la condamine , which includes the famous harbour .
it is unique in having been held on the same circuit every time it has been run over such a long period – only the italian grand prix , which has been held at autodromo nazionale monza during every formula one regulated year except *num* , has a similarly lengthy and close relationship with a single circuit .
the race circuit has many elevation changes , tight corners , and a narrow course that makes it one of the most demanding tracks in formula one racing .
, two drivers have crashed and ended up in the harbour , the most famous being alberto ascari in *num* .
despite the fact that the course has had minor changes several times during its history , it is still considered the ultimate test of driving skills in formula one , and if it were not already an existing grand prix , it would not be permitted to be added to the schedule for safety reasons .
even in *num* , ' la vie automobile ' magazine offered the opinion that " any respectable traffic system would have covered the track with « danger » sign posts left , right and centre " .
triple formula one champion nelson piquet was fond of saying that racing at monaco was " like trying to cycle round your living room " , but added that " a win here was worth two anywhere else " .
notably , the course includes a tunnel .
the contrast of daylight and gloom when entering / exiting the tunnel presents " challenges not faced elsewhere " , as the drivers have to " adjust their vision as they emerge from the tunnel at the fastest point of the track and brake for the chicane in the daylight .

*num* during the grand prix weekend , spectators crowd around the monaco circuit .
there are a number of temporary grandstands built around the circuit , mostly around the harbour area .
the rich and famous spectators often arrive on their boats and the yachts through the harbour .
balconies around monaco become viewing areas for the race as well .
many hotels and residents cash in on the bird's eye views of the race .
the monaco grand prix is organised each year by the " automobile club de monaco " which also runs the monte carlo rally and the junior monaco kart cup .
the monaco grand prix differs in several ways from other grands prix .
the practice session for the race is held on the thursday preceding the race instead of friday .
this allows the streets to be opened to the public again on friday .
until the late 1990s the race started at *num* : *num* p .
m .
local time – an hour and a half later than other european formula one races .
in recent years the race has fallen in line with the other formula one races for the convenience of television viewers .
also , earlier the event was traditionally held on the week of ascension day .
it is now always held on the last weekend in may .
for many years , the numbers of cars admitted to grands prix was at the discretion of the race organisers – monaco had the smallest grids , ostensibly because of its narrow and twisting track .
only *num* cars were permitted to enter the *num* monaco grand prix , compared to *num* to *num* cars at all other rounds that year .
the erecting of the circuit takes six weeks , and the removal after the race takes three weeks .
there was no podium as such at the race , until *num* .
instead , a section of the track is closed after the race to act as parc fermé , a place where the cars are held for official inspection .
the first three drivers in the race leave their cars there and walk directly to the royal box where the ' podium ' ceremony is held , which is considered a custom for the race .
the trophies are handed out before the national anthems for the winning driver and team are played , as opposed to other grands prix where the anthems are played first .
the monaco grand prix is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world alongside the indianapolis *num* and the *num* hours of le mans .
these three races are considered to form a " triple crown " of the three most famous motor races in the world .
as of *num* graham hill is the only driver to have won the triple crown , by winning all three races .
the practice session for monaco overlaps with that for the indianapolis *num* , and the races themselves sometimes clash .
as the two races take place on opposite sides of the atlantic ocean and form part of different championships , it is difficult for one driver to compete effectively in both during his career .
juan pablo montoya and fernando alonso are the only active drivers to have won two of the three events .
in awarding its first gold medal for motorsport to prince rainier iii , the fédération internationale de l'automobile ( fia ) characterised the monaco grand prix as contributing " an exceptional location of glamour and prestige " to motorsport .
the grand prix has been run under the patronage of three generations of monaco's royal family : louis ii , rainier iii and albert ii , all of whom have taken a close interest in the race .
a large part of the principality's income comes from tourists attracted by the warm climate and the famous casino , but it is also a tax haven and is home to many millionaires , including several formula one drivers .
monaco has produced four native formula one drivers - louis chiron , andré testut , olivier beretta , and charles leclerc - but its tax status has made it home to many drivers over the years , including gilles villeneuve and ayrton senna .
of the formula one contenders , several have property in the principality , including jenson button and david coulthard , who was part owner of a hotel there .
because of the small size of the town and the location of the circuit , drivers whose races end early can usually get back to their apartments in minutes .
ayrton senna famously retired to his apartment after crashing out of the lead of the *num* race .

alpha helix the alpha helix ( α-helix ) is a common motif in the secondary structure of proteins and is a right hand-spiral conformation ( i .
e .
helix ) in which every backbone n−h group donates a hydrogen bond to the backbone c=o group of the amino acid located three or four residues earlier along the protein sequence .
the alpha helix is also called a classic pauling–corey–branson α-helix .
the name *num* .
6-helix is also used for this type of helix , denoting the average number of residues per helical turn , with *num* atoms being involved in the ring formed by the hydrogen bond .
among types of local structure in proteins , the α-helix is the most regular and the most predictable from sequence , as well as the most prevalent .
in the early 1930s , william astbury showed that there were drastic changes in the x-ray fiber diffraction of moist wool or hair fibers upon significant stretching .
the data suggested that the unstretched fibers had a coiled molecular structure with a characteristic repeat of ~ .
astbury initially proposed a kinked-chain structure for the fibers .
he later joined other researchers ( notably the american chemist maurice huggins ) in proposing that : although incorrect in their details , astbury's models of these forms were correct in essence and correspond to modern elements of secondary structure , the α-helix and the β-strand ( astbury's nomenclature was kept ) , which were developed by linus pauling , robert corey and herman branson in *num* ( see below ) ; that paper showed both right- and left-handed helices , although in *num* the crystal structure of myoglobin showed that the right-handed form is the common one .
hans neurath was the first to show that astbury's models could not be correct in detail , because they involved clashes of atoms .
neurath's paper and astbury's data inspired h .
s .
taylor , maurice huggins and bragg and collaborators to propose models of keratin that somewhat resemble the modern α-helix .
two key developments in the modeling of the modern α-helix were : the correct bond geometry , thanks to the crystal structure determinations of amino acids and peptides and pauling's prediction of " planar " peptide bonds ; and his relinquishing of the assumption of an integral number of residues per turn of the helix .
the pivotal moment came in the early spring of *num* , when pauling caught a cold and went to bed .
being bored , he drew a polypeptide chain of roughly correct dimensions on a strip of paper and folded it into a helix , being careful to maintain the planar peptide bonds .
after a few attempts , he produced a model with physically plausible hydrogen bonds .
pauling then worked with corey and branson to confirm his model before publication .
in *num* , pauling was awarded his first nobel prize " for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the elucidation of the structure of complex substances " ( such as proteins ) , prominently including the structure of the α-helix .
the amino acids in an α-helix are arranged in a right-handed helical structure where each amino acid residue corresponds to a 100° turn in the helix ( i .
e .
, the helix has *num* .
*num* residues per turn ) , and a translation of along the helical axis .
dunitz describes how pauling's first article on the theme in fact shows a left-handed helix , the enantiomer of the true structure .
short pieces of left-handed helix sometimes occur with a large content of achiral glycine amino acids , but are unfavorable for the other normal , biological -amino acids .
the pitch of the alpha-helix ( the vertical distance between consecutive turns of the helix ) is , which is the product of *num* .
*num* and *num* .
*num* .
what is most important is that the n-h group of an amino acid forms a hydrogen bond with the c=o group of the amino acid " four " residues earlier ; this repeated " i" + *num* → " i " hydrogen bonding is the most prominent characteristic of an α-helix .
official international nomenclature specifies two ways of defining α-helices , rule *num* .
*num* in terms of repeating " φ " , " ψ " torsion angles ( see below ) and rule *num* .
*num* in terms of the combined pattern of pitch and hydrogen bonding .
the α-helices can be identified in protein structure using several computational methods , one of which being dssp ( dictionary of protein secondary structure ) .
similar structures include the *num* helix ( " i" + *num* → " i " hydrogen bonding ) and the π-helix ( " i" + *num* → " i " hydrogen bonding ) .
the α-helix can be described as a *num* .
*num* helix , since the " i" + *num* spacing adds three more atoms to the h-bonded loop compared to the tighter *num* helix , and on average , *num* .
*num* amino acids are involved in one ring of α-helix .
the subscripts refer to the number of atoms ( including the hydrogen ) in the closed loop formed by the hydrogen bond .
residues in α-helices typically adopt backbone ( " φ " , "ψ " ) dihedral angles around ( −60° , −45° ) , as shown in the image at right .
in more general terms , they adopt dihedral angles such that the " ψ " dihedral angle of one residue and the " φ " dihedral angle of the " next " residue sum to roughly −105° .
as a consequence , α-helical dihedral angles , in general , fall on a diagonal stripe on the ramachandran diagram ( of slope −1 ) , ranging from ( −90° , −15° ) to ( −35° , −70° ) .
for comparison , the sum of the dihedral angles for a *num* helix is roughly −75° , whereas that for the π-helix is roughly −130° .
the general formula for the rotation angle " ω " per residue of any polypeptide helix with " trans " isomers is given by the equation the α-helix is tightly packed ; there is almost no free space within the helix .
the amino-acid side-chains are on the outside of the helix , and point roughly " downward " ( i .
e .
, toward the n-terminus ) , like the branches of an evergreen tree ( christmas tree effect ) .
this directionality is sometimes used in preliminary , low-resolution electron-density maps to determine the direction of the protein backbone .
three differently arranged styles of 2d diagrams are used to represent different aspects of the sequence and structure relationships that confer specific physical and interaction properties on individual α-helices .
two of these emphasize circular placement around the cylindrical cross-section : the first-developed such diagram is called the " helical wheel " , and a more recent version is called the " wenxiang diagram " .
the latter name came from the fact that it resembles a coil-like incense used in china to repel mosquitos ( ) .
the helical wheel represents a helix by a projection of the c backbone structure down the helix axis , while the wenxiang diagram represents it more abstractly as a smooth spiral coiled on the plane of the page .
both label the sequence with one-letter amino-acid code ( see amino acid ) at each c position , using different colors or symbols to code the amino-acid properties .
hydrophobic vs hydrophilic amino acids are always distinguished , as the most important property governing helix interactions .
sometimes positively vs negatively charged hydrophilics are distinguished , and sometimes ambiguous amino acids such as glycine ( g ) are distinguished .
color-coding conventions are various .
the helical wheel does not change representation along the helix , while the wenxiang diagram is able to show the relative locations of the amino acids in an α-helix regardless of how long it is .
either circular style of diagram can provide an intuitive and easily visualizable 2d picture that characterizes the disposition of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues in α-helices , and can be used to study helix–helix interactions , helix-membrane interactions as quantified by the helical hydrophobic moment , or protein-protein interactions .
various utilities and web sites are available to generate helical wheels , such as the page by kael fischer .
the third style of 2d diagram is called a " helical net " .
it is generated by opening the cylindrical surface of each helix along a line parallel to the axis and laying the result out vertically .
the helix net is not suitable for studying helix–helix packing interactions , but it has become the dominant means of representing the sequence arrangement for integral membrane proteins because it shows important relationships of the helical sequence to vertical positioning within the membrane even without knowledge of how the helices are arranged in 3d .
helices observed in proteins can range from four to over forty residues long , but a typical helix contains about ten amino acids ( about three turns ) .
in general , short polypeptides do not exhibit much α-helical structure in solution , since the entropic cost associated with the folding of the polypeptide chain is not compensated for by a sufficient amount of stabilizing interactions .
in general , the backbone hydrogen bonds of α-helices are considered slightly weaker than those found in β-sheets , and are readily attacked by the ambient water molecules .
however , in more hydrophobic environments such as the plasma membrane , or in the presence of co-solvents such as trifluoroethanol ( tfe ) , or isolated from solvent in the gas phase , oligopeptides readily adopt stable α-helical structure .
furthermore , crosslinks can be incorporated into peptides to conformationally stabilize helical folds .
crosslinks stabilize the helical state by entropically destabilizing the unfolded state and by removing enthalpically stabilized " decoy " folds that compete with the fully helical state .
it has been shown that α-helices are more stable , robust to mutations and designable than β-strands in natural proteins , and also in artificial designed proteins .
since the α-helix is defined by its hydrogen bonds and backbone conformation , the most detailed experimental evidence for α-helical structure comes from atomic-resolution x-ray crystallography such as the example shown at right .
it is clear that all the backbone carbonyl oxygens point downward ( toward the c-terminus ) but splay out slightly , and the h-bonds are approximately parallel to the helix axis .
protein structures from nmr spectroscopy also show helices well , with characteristic observations of nuclear overhauser effect ( noe ) couplings between atoms on adjacent helical turns .
in some cases , the individual hydrogen bonds can be observed directly as a small scalar coupling in nmr .
there are several lower-resolution methods for assigning general helical structure .
the nmr chemical shifts ( in particular of the c , c and c′ ) and residual dipolar couplings are often characteristic of helices .
the far-uv ( 170–250 nm ) circular dichroism spectrum of helices is also idiosyncratic , exhibiting a pronounced double minimum at around *num* and *num* nm .
infrared spectroscopy is rarely used , since the α-helical spectrum resembles that of a random coil ( although these might be discerned by , e .
g .
, hydrogen-deuterium exchange ) .
finally , cryo electron microscopy is now capable of discerning individual α-helices within a protein , although their assignment to residues is still an active area of research .
long homopolymers of amino acids often form helices if soluble .
such long , isolated helices can also be detected by other methods , such as dielectric relaxation , flow birefringence , and measurements of the diffusion constant .
in stricter terms , these methods detect only the characteristic prolate ( long cigar-like ) hydrodynamic shape of a helix , or its large dipole moment .
different amino-acid sequences have different propensities for forming α-helical structure .
methionine , alanine , leucine , glutamate , and lysine uncharged ( " malek " in the amino-acid 1-letter codes ) all have especially high helix-forming propensities , whereas proline and glycine have poor helix-forming propensities .
proline either breaks or kinks a helix , both because it cannot donate an amide hydrogen bond ( having no amide hydrogen ) , and also because its sidechain interferes sterically with the backbone of the preceding turn inside a helix , this forces a bend of about 30° in the helix's axis .
however , proline is often seen as the " first " residue of a helix , it is presumed due to its structural rigidity .
at the other extreme , glycine also tends to disrupt helices because its high conformational flexibility makes it entropically expensive to adopt the relatively constrained α-helical structure .
estimated differences in free energy , δ ( δ"g " ) , estimated in kcal / mol per residue in an α-helical configuration , relative to alanine arbitrarily set as zero .
higher numbers ( more positive free energies ) are less favoured .
significant deviations from these average numbers are possible , depending on the identities of the neighbouring residues .
a helix has an overall dipole moment due to the aggregate effect of the individual microdipoles from the carbonyl groups of the peptide bond pointing along the helix axis .
the effects of this macrodipole are a matter of some controversy .
α-helices often occur with the n-terminal end bound by a negatively charged group , sometimes an amino acid side chain such as glutamate or aspartate , or sometimes a phosphate ion .
some regard the helix macrodipole as interacting electrostatically with such groups .
others feel that this is misleading and it is more realistic to say that the hydrogen bond potential of the free nh groups at the n-terminus of an α-helix can be satisfied by hydrogen bonding ; this can also be regarded as set of interactions between local microdipoles such as .
coiled-coil α helices are highly stable forms in which two or more helices wrap around each other in a " supercoil " structure .
coiled coils contain a highly characteristic sequence motif known as a heptad repeat , in which the motif repeats itself every seven residues along the sequence ( " amino acid " residues , not dna base-pairs ) .
the first and especially the fourth residues ( known as the " a " and " d " positions ) are almost always hydrophobic ; the fourth residue is typically leucine this gives rise to the name of the structural motif called a " leucine zipper " , which is a type of coiled-coil .
these hydrophobic residues pack together in the interior of the helix bundle .
in general , the fifth and seventh residues ( the " e " and " g " positions ) have opposing charges and form a salt bridge stabilized by electrostatic interactions .
fibrous proteins such as keratin or the " stalks " of myosin or kinesin often adopt coiled-coil structures , as do several dimerizing proteins .
a pair of coiled-coils a four-helix bundle is a very common structural motif in proteins .
for example , it occurs in human growth hormone and several varieties of cytochrome .
the rop protein , which promotes plasmid replication in bacteria , is an interesting case in which a single polypeptide forms a coiled-coil and two monomers assemble to form a four-helix bundle .
the amino acids that make up a particular helix can be plotted on a helical wheel , a representation that illustrates the orientations of the constituent amino acids ( see the article for leucine zipper for such a diagram ) .
often in globular proteins , as well as in specialized structures such as coiled-coils and leucine zippers , an α-helix will exhibit two " faces " one containing predominantly hydrophobic amino acids oriented toward the interior of the protein , in the hydrophobic core , and one containing predominantly polar amino acids oriented toward the solvent-exposed surface of the protein .
changes in binding orientation also occur for facially-organized oligopeptides .
this pattern is especially common in antimicrobial peptides , and many models have been devised to describe how this relates to their function .
common to many of them is that the hydrophobic face of the antimicrobial peptide forms pores in the plasma membrane after associating with the fatty chains at the membrane core .
myoglobin and hemoglobin , the first two proteins whose structures were solved by x-ray crystallography , have very similar folds made up of about *num* % α-helix , with the rest being non-repetitive regions , or " loops " that connect the helices .
in classifying proteins by their dominant fold , the structural classification of proteins database maintains a large category specifically for all-α proteins .
hemoglobin then has an even larger-scale quaternary structure , in which the functional oxygen-binding molecule is made up of four subunits .
α-helices have particular significance in dna binding motifs , including helix-turn-helix motifs , leucine zipper motifs and zinc finger motifs .
this is because of the convenient structural fact that the diameter of an α-helix is about including an average set of sidechains , about the same as the width of the major groove in b-form dna , and also because coiled-coil ( or leucine zipper ) dimers of helices can readily position a pair of interaction surfaces to contact the sort of symmetrical repeat common in double-helical dna .
an example of both aspects is the transcription factor max ( see image at left ) , which uses a helical coiled coil to dimerize , positioning another pair of helices for interaction in two successive turns of the dna major groove .
α-helices are also the most common protein structure element that crosses biological membranes ( transmembrane protein ) , it is presumed because the helical structure can satisfy all backbone hydrogen-bonds internally , leaving no polar groups exposed to the membrane if the sidechains are hydrophobic .
proteins are sometimes anchored by a single membrane-spanning helix , sometimes by a pair , and sometimes by a helix bundle , most classically consisting of seven helices arranged up-and-down in a ring such as for rhodopsins ( see image at right ) or for g protein–coupled receptors ( gpcrs ) .
α-helices under axial tensile deformation , a characteristic loading condition that appears in many alpha-helix-rich filaments and tissues , results in a characteristic three-phase behavior of stiff-soft-stiff tangent modulus .
phase i corresponds to the small-deformation regime during which the helix is stretched homogeneously , followed by phase ii , in which alpha-helical turns break mediated by the rupture of groups of h-bonds .
phase iii is typically associated with large-deformation covalent bond stretching .
alpha-helices in proteins may have low-frequency accordion-like motion as observed by the raman spectroscopy and analyzed via the quasi-continuum model .
helices not stabilized by tertiary interactions show dynamic behavior , which can be mainly attributed to helix fraying from the ends .
homopolymers of amino acids ( such as polylysine ) can adopt α-helical structure at low temperature that is " melted out " at high temperatures .
this helix–coil transition was once thought to be analogous to protein denaturation .
the statistical mechanics of this transition can be modeled using an elegant transfer matrix method , characterized by two parameters : the propensity to initiate a helix and the propensity to extend a helix .
at least five artists have made explicit reference to the α-helix in their work : julie newdoll in painting and julian voss-andreae , bathsheba grossman , byron rubin , and mike tyka in sculpture .
san francisco area artist julie newdoll , who holds a degree in microbiology with a minor in art , has specialized in paintings inspired by microscopic images and molecules since *num* .
her painting " rise of the alpha helix " ( *num* ) features human figures arranged in an α helical arrangement .
according to the artist , " the flowers reflect the various types of sidechains that each amino acid holds out to the world " .
this same metaphor is also echoed from the scientist's side : " β sheets do not show a stiff repetitious regularity but flow in graceful , twisting curves , and even the α-helix is regular more in the manner of a flower stem , whose branching nodes show the influence of environment , developmental history , and the evolution of each part to match its own idiosyncratic function .
" julian voss-andreae is a german-born sculptor with degrees in experimental physics and sculpture .
since *num* voss-andreae creates " protein sculptures " based on protein structure with the α-helix being one of his preferred objects .
voss-andreae has made α-helix sculptures from diverse materials including bamboo and whole trees .
a monument voss-andreae created in *num* to celebrate the memory of linus pauling , the discoverer of the α-helix , is fashioned from a large steel beam rearranged in the structure of the α-helix .
the , bright-red sculpture stands in front of pauling's childhood home in portland , oregon .
ribbon diagrams of α-helices are a prominent element in the laser-etched crystal sculptures of protein structures created by artist bathsheba grossman , such as those of insulin , hemoglobin , and dna polymerase .
byron rubin is a former protein crystallographer now professional sculptor in metal of proteins , nucleic acids , and drug molecules many of which featuring α-helices , such as subtilisin , human growth hormone , and phospholipase a2 .
mike tyka is a computational biochemist at the university of washington working with david baker .
tyka has been making sculptures of protein molecules since *num* from copper and steel , including ubiquitin and a potassium channel tetramer .
emperor jimmu jimmu is recorded as japan's first ruler in two early chronicles , " nihon shoki " ( *num* ) and " kojiki " ( *num* ) .
" nihon shoki " gives the dates of his reign as 660–585 bc .
in the reign of emperor kanmu ( 737–806 ad ) , the eighth-century scholar ōmi no mifune designated rulers before ōjin as , a japanese pendant to the chinese imperial title " tiān-dì " ( 天帝 ) , and gave several of them including jimmu their canonical names .
prior to this time , these rulers had been known as " sumera no mikoto" / "ōkimi " .
this practice had begun under empress suiko , and took root after the taika reforms with the ascendancy of the nakatomi clan .
according to the legendary account in the " kojiki " , emperor jimmu was born on february *num* , *num* bc ( the first day of the first month of the chinese calendar ) , and died , again according to legend , on april *num* , *num* bc ( the eleventh day of the third month ) .
both the " kojiki " and the " nihon shoki " give jimmu's name as .
" iware " indicates a toponym whose precise purport is unclear .
the imperial house of japan traditionally based its claim to the throne on its putative descent from the sun-goddess amaterasu via jimmu's great-grandfather ninigi .
consort : ahiratsu-hime ( 吾平津媛 ) , honosusori’s daughter ( ninigi-no-mikoto’s son ) empress : himetataraisuzu-hime ( 媛蹈鞴五十鈴媛 ) , kotoshironushi’s daughter in japanese mythology , the age of the gods is the period before jimmu's accession .
the story of jimmu seems to rework legends associated with the ōtomo clan , and its function was to establish that clan's links to the ruling family , just as those of suijin arguably reflect mononobe tales and the legends in ōjin's chronicles seem to derive from soga clan traditions .
jimmu figures as a direct descendant of the sun goddess , amaterasu via the side of his father , ugayafukiaezu .
amaterasu had a son called ame no oshihomimi no mikoto and through him a grandson named ninigi-no-mikoto .
she sent her grandson to the japanese islands where he eventually married konohana-sakuya-hime .
among their three sons was hikohohodemi no mikoto , also called yamasachi-hiko , who married toyotama-hime .
she was the daughter of ryūjin , the japanese sea god .
they had a single son called hikonagisa takeugaya fukiaezu no mikoto .
the boy was abandoned by his parents at birth and consequently raised by tamayori-hime , his mother's younger sister .
they eventually married and had four sons .
the last of these , kamu-yamato iware-biko no mikoto , became emperor jimmu .
according to the chronicles " kojiki " and " nihon shoki " , jimmu's brothers were born in takachiho , the southern part of kyūshū in modern-day miyazaki prefecture .
they moved eastward to find a location more appropriate for administering the entire country .
jimmu's older brother , itsuse no mikoto , originally led the migration , and led the clan eastward through the seto inland sea with the assistance of local chieftain " sao netsuhiko " .
as they reached naniwa ( modern-day osaka ) , they encountered another local chieftain , " nagasunehiko " ( " the long-legged man " ) , and itsuse was killed in the ensuing battle .
jimmu realized that they had been defeated because they battled eastward against the sun , so he decided to land on the east side of kii peninsula and to battle westward .
they reached kumano , and , with the guidance of a three-legged crow , " yatagarasu " ( " eight-span crow " ) , they moved to yamato .
there , they once again battled nagasunehiko and were victorious .
in yamato , " nigihayahi no mikoto " , who also claim descent from the takamagahara gods , was protected by nagasunehiko .
however , when nigihayahi met jimmu , he accepted jimmu's legitimacy .
at this point , jimmu is said to have ascended to the throne of japan .
upon scaling a nara mountain to survey the seto inland sea he now controlled , jimmu remarked that it was shaped like the " heart " rings made by mating dragonflies , archaically " akitsu " 秋津 .
a mosquito then tried to steal jimmu's royal blood but since jimmu was a god incarnate emperor , " akitsumikami " 現御神 , a dragonfly killed the mosquito .
japan thus received its classical name the dragonfly islands , " akitsushima " 秋津島 .
according to the " kojiki " , jimmu died when he was *num* years old .
this emperor's posthumous name literally means " divine might " or " god-warrior " .
it is undisputed that this identification is chinese in form and buddhist in implication , which suggests that the name must have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to jimmu .
it is generally thought that jimmu's name and character evolved into their present shape just before the time in which legends about the origins of the yamato dynasty were chronicled in the " kojiki " .
there are accounts written earlier than either " kojiki " and " nihon shoki " that present an alternative version of the story .
according to these accounts , jimmu's dynasty was supplanted by that of ōjin , whose dynasty was supplanted by that of keitai .
the " kojiki " and the " nihon shoki " then combined these three mythical dynasties into one long and continuous genealogy .
the traditional site of jimmu's grave is near unebiyama in kashihara .
the japanese historian ino okifu identifies jimmu with the han chinese explorer and sage xu fu , who searched the philosopher's stone for emperor qin shihuangdi .
xu fu reached japan with over *num* men and women and never returned .
after his arrival the yayoi period started .
veneration of jimmu was a central component of the imperial cult that formed following the meiji restoration .
in *num* , a holiday called " kigensetsu " was established on february *num* .
the holiday commemorated the anniversary of jimmu's ascension to the throne *num* , *num* years earlier .
after world war ii , the holiday was criticized as too closely associated with the " emperor system .
" it was suspended from *num* to *num* , but later reinstated as national foundation day .
between *num* and *num* an imperial envoy sent offerings every year to the supposed site of jimmu's tomb .
in *num* kashihara shrine was established nearby , on the spot where jimmu was said to have ascended to the throne .
before and during world war ii , expansionist propaganda made frequent use of the phrase " hakkō ichiu " , a term coined by tanaka chigaku based on a passage in the " nihon shoki " discussing emperor jimmu .
some media incorrectly attributed the phrase to emperor jimmu .
for the *num* " kigensetsu " celebration , marking the supposed *num* , *ord* anniversary of jimmu's enthronement , the peace tower was constructed in miyazaki .
the same year numerous stone monuments relating to key events in jimmu's life were erected around japan .
the sites at which these monuments were erected are known as " emperor jimmu sacred historical sites " .

soon after this experience , in *num* , he wrote the essay " the cathedral and the bazaar " , detailing his thoughts on open-source software development and why it should be done as openly as possible ( i .
e .
, the " bazaar " approach ) .
the essay was based in part on his experience in developing fetchmail .
he first presented his thesis at the annual linux kongress on may *num* , *num* .
he later expanded the essay into a book , " the cathedral and the bazaar : musings on linux and open source by an accidental revolutionary " , in *num* .
the internal white paper by frank hecker that led to the release of the mozilla ( then netscape ) source code in *num* cited " the cathedral and the bazaar " as " independent validation " of ideas proposed by eric hahn and jamie zawinski .
hahn would later describe the *num* book as " clearly influential " .
from the late 1990s onward , due in part to the popularity of his essay , raymond became a prominent voice in the open source movement .
he co-founded the open source initiative in *num* , taking on the self-appointed role of ambassador of open source to the press , business and public .
he remains active in osi , and stepped down as president of the initiative in february *num* .
in *num* raymond received and published a microsoft document expressing worry about the quality of rival open-source software .
eric named this document , together with others subsequently leaked , " "the halloween documents" " .
in 2000–2002 he created cml2 , a source code configuration system ; while originally intended for the linux operating system , it was rejected by kernel developers .
raymond attributed this rejection to " kernel list politics " .
linus torvalds on the other hand said in a *num* mailing list post that as a matter of policy , the development team preferred more incremental changes .
his *num* book " the art of unix programming " discusses user tools for programming and other tasks .
raymond is currently the administrator of the project page for the gps data tool gpsd .
also , some versions of nethack include his guide .
he has also contributed code and content to the free software video game " the battle for wesnoth " .
raymond coined an aphorism he dubbed " linus's law " , inspired by linus torvalds : " given enough eyeballs , all bugs are shallow " .
it first appeared in his book " the cathedral and the bazaar " .
raymond has refused to speculate on whether the " bazaar " development model could be applied to works such as books and music , not wanting to " weaken the winning argument for open-sourcing software by tying it to a potential loser " .
raymond has had a number of public disputes with other figures in the free software movement .
as head of the open source initiative , he argued that advocates should focus on the potential for better products .
the " very seductive " moral and ethical rhetoric of richard stallman and the free software foundation fails , he said , " not because his principles are wrong , but because that kind of language .
.
.
simply does not persuade anybody " .
in a *num* essay he " defended the right of programmers to issue work under proprietary licenses because i think that if a programmer wants to write a program and sell it , it's neither my business nor anyone else's but his customer's what the terms of sale are " .
in the same essay he also said that the " logic of the system " puts developers into " dysfunctional roles " , with bad code the result .
raymond is a member of the libertarian party .
he is a gun rights advocate .
he has endorsed the open source firearms organization defense distributed , calling them " friends of freedom " and writing " i approve of any development that makes it more difficult for governments and criminals to monopolize the use of force .
as 3d printers become less expensive and more ubiquitous , this could be a major step in the right direction .
" in *num* raymond accused the ada initiative and other women in tech groups of attempting to entrap male open source leaders and accuse them of rape , saying " try to avoid even being alone , ever , because there is a chance that a ' women in tech ' advocacy group is going to try to collect your scalp .
" raymond is also known for claiming that “gays experimented with unfettered promiscuity in the 1970s and got aids as a consequence” and that “police who react to a random black male behaving suspiciously who might be in the critical age range as though he is an near-imminent lethal threat , are being rational , not racist .
” progressive campaign the great slate was successful in raising funds for candidates in part by asking for contributions from tech workers in return for not posting similar quotes by raymond .
matasano security employee and great slate fundraiser thomas ptacek said , “i’ve been torturing twitter with lurid eric s .
raymond quotes for years .
every time i do , *num* people beg me to stop .
” it is estimated that as of march *num* over $30 , *num* has been raised in this way .
raymond describes himself as neo-pagan .
cow tipping cow tipping is the purported activity of sneaking up on any unsuspecting or sleeping upright cow and pushing it over for entertainment .
the practice of cow tipping is generally considered an urban legend , and stories of such feats viewed as tall tales .
the implication that rural citizens seek such entertainment due to lack of alternatives is viewed as a stereotype .
the concept of cow tipping apparently developed in the 1970s , though tales of animals that cannot rise if they fall has historical antecedents dating to the roman empire .
cows routinely lie down and can easily regain their footing unless sick or injured .
scientific studies have been conducted to determine if cow tipping is theoretically possible , with varying conclusions .
all agree that cows are large animals that are difficult to surprise and will generally resist attempts to be tipped .
estimates suggest a force of between is needed , and that at least four and possibly as many as fourteen people would be required to achieve this .
in real-life situations where cattle have to be laid on the ground , or " cast " , such as for branding , hoof care or veterinary treatment , either rope restraints are required or specialized mechanical equipment is used that confines the cow and then tips it over .
on rare occasions , cattle can lie down or fall down in proximity to a ditch or hill that restricts their normal ability to rise without help .
cow tipping has many references in popular culture and is also used as a figure of speech .
the urban legend of cow tipping relies upon the presumption that cattle are slow-moving , dim-witted , and weak-legged , thus easily pushed over without much force .
some versions suggest that because cows sleep standing up , it is possible to approach them and push them over without the animals reacting .
however , cows only sleep lightly while standing up , and they are easily awakened .
they lie down to sleep deeply .
furthermore , numerous sources have questioned the practice's feasibility , since most cows weigh over half a ton and easily resist any lesser force .
a *num* study led by margo lillie , a zoologist at the university of british columbia , and her student tracy boechler , concluded that tipping a cow would require a force of nearly and is therefore impossible to accomplish by a single person .
her calculations found that it would require more than four people to apply enough force to push over a cow , based on an estimate that a single person could exert of force .
however , since a cow can brace itself , lillie and boechler suggested that five or six people would , most likely , be needed .
further , cattle are well aware of their surroundings and are very difficult to surprise , due to excellent senses of both smell and hearing .
lillie and boechler's analysis found that if a cow did not move , the principles of static physics suggest that two people might be able to tip a cow if its centre of mass were pushed over its hooves before the cow could react .
however , cows are not rigid or unresponsive , and the faster humans have to move , the less force they can exert .
thus lillie and boechler concluded that it is unlikely that cows can actually be tipped over in this way .
lillie stated , " it just makes the physics of it all , in my opinion , impossible .
" although he agrees that it would take a force of about *num* , *num* newtons to push over a standing cow , biologist steven vogel thinks that the study by lillie and boechler overestimates the pushing ability of an individual human .
using data from cotterell and kamminga , who estimated that humans exert a pushing force of *num* newtons , vogel suggests that someone applying force at the requisite height to topple a cow might generate a maximum push of no more than *num* newtons .
by this calculation , at least *num* people would be needed to tip over a non-reacting cow .
however , this combined force requirement , he says , might not be the greatest impediment to such a prank .
standing cows are not asleep and like other animals have ever-vigilant reflexes .
" if the cow does no more than modestly widen its stance without an overall shift of its center of gravity " , he says , " about *num* , *num* newtons or *num* pushers would be needed—quite a challenge to deploy without angering the cow .
" the belief that certain animals cannot rise if pushed over has historical antecedents , though cattle have never been so classified .
julius caesar recorded a belief that a european elk had no knee joints and could not get up if it fell .
pliny said the same about the hind legs of an animal he called the achlis , which pliny's 19th-century translators bostock and riley said was merely another name for the elk .
they also noted that pliny's belief about the jointless back legs of the achlis ( elk ) was false .
in *num* , louis ix of france gave an elephant to henry iii of england for his menagerie in the tower of london .
a drawing by the historian matthew paris for his " chronica majora " can be seen in his bestiary at parker library of corpus christi college , cambridge .
an accompanying text cites elephant lore suggesting that elephants did not have knees and were unable to get up if they fell .
journalist jake steelhammer believes the american urban myth of cow tipping originated in the 1970s .
it " stampeded into the ' 80s " , he says , " when movies like " tommy boy " and " heathers " featured cow tipping expeditions .
" stories about cow tipping tend to be second-hand , he says , told by someone who does not claim to have tipped a cow but who knows someone else who says he or she did .
cattle may need to be deliberately thrown or tipped over for certain types of husbandry practices and medical treatment .
when done for medical purposes , this is often called " casting " , and when performed without mechanical assistance requires the attachment of of rope around the body and legs of the animal .
after the rope is secured by non-slip bowline knots , it is pulled to the rear until the animal is off-balance .
once the cow is forced to lie down in sternal recumbency ( on its chest ) , it can be rolled onto its side and its legs tied to prevent kicking .
a calf table or calf cradle , also called a " tipping table " or a " throw down " , is a relatively modern invention designed to be used on calves that are being branded .
a calf is run into a chute , confined , and then tipped by the equipment onto its side for easier branding and castration .
hydraulic tilt tables for adult cattle have existed since the 1970s and are designed to lift and tip cattle onto their sides to enable veterinary care , particularly of the animals ' genitalia , and for hoof maintenance .
( unlike horses , cows generally do not cooperate with a farrier when standing .
) a canadian veterinarian explained , " using the table is much safer and easier than trying to get underneath to examine the animal " , and noted that cows tipped over on a padded table usually stop struggling and become calm fairly quickly .
one design , developed at the western college of veterinary medicine in saskatoon , saskatchewan , included " cow comfort " as a unique aspect of care using this type of apparatus .
cows may tip themselves inadvertently .
due to their bulk and relatively short legs , cattle cannot roll over .
those that lie down and roll to their sides with their feet pointing uphill may become stuck and unable to rise without assistance , with potentially fatal results .
in such cases , two humans can roll or flip a cow onto its other side , so that its feet are aimed downhill , thus allowing it to rise on its own .
in one documented case of " real-life cow tipping " , a pregnant cow rolled into a gully in new hampshire and became trapped in an inverted state until rescued by volunteer fire fighters .
the owner of the cow commented that he had seen this happen " once or twice " before .
trauma or illness may also result in a cow unable to rise to its feet .
such animals are sometimes called " downers .
" sometimes this occurs as a result of muscle and nerve damage from calving or a disease such as mastitis .
leg injuries , muscle tears , or a massive infection of some sort may also be causes .
downer cows are encouraged to get to their feet and have a much greater chance of recovery if they do .
if unable to rise , some have survived—with medical care—as long as *num* days and were ultimately able to get back on their feet .
appropriate medical treatment for a downer cow to prevent further injury includes rolling from one side to the other every three hours , careful and frequent feeding of small amounts of fodder , and access to clean water .
dead animals may appear to have been tipped over .
but this is actually the process of rigor mortis , which stiffens the muscles of the carcass , beginning six to eight hours after death and lasting for one to two days .
it is particularly noticeable in the limbs , which stick out straight .
post-mortem bloat also occurs because of gas formation inside the body .
the process may result in cattle carcasses that wind up on their back with all four feet in the air .
assorted individuals have claimed to have performed cow tipping , often while under the influence of alcohol .
these claims , to date , cannot be reliably verified , with jake swearingen of " modern farmer " noting in *num* that youtube , a popular source of videos of challenges and stunts , " fails to deliver one single actual cow-tipping video " .
pranksters have sometimes pushed over artificial cows .
along chicago's michigan avenue in *num* , two " apparently drunk " men felled six fiberglass cows that were part of a cows on parade public art exhibit .
four other vandals removed a " wow cow " sculpture from its lifeguard chair at oak street beach and abandoned it in a pedestrian underpass .
a year later , new york city anchored its cowparade art cows , including " a streetcow named desire " , to concrete bases " to prevent the udder disrespect of cow-tippers and thieves .
" cow tipping has been featured in films from the 1980s and later , such as " heathers " ( *num* ) , " tommy boy " ( *num* ) , " barnyard " ( *num* ) , and " i love you , beth cooper " ( *num* ) .
it was also used in the title of a *num* documentary film by randy redroad , " cow tipping–the militant indian waiter " .
the film " cars " ( *num* ) features a vehicular variant called tractor-tipping .
in the little willies song " lou reed " from their *num* eponymous debut album , norah jones sings about a fictional event during which musician lou reed tips cows in texas .
in another medium , " the big bang theory " , a television show , uses cow tipping lore as an element to establish the nature of a rural character , penny .
the term " cow tipping " is sometimes used as a figure of speech for pushing over something big .
in " a giant cow-tipping by savages " , author john weir close uses the term to describe contemporary mergers and acquisitions .
" tipping sacred cows " has been used as a deliberate mixed metaphor in titles of books on christian ministry and business management .
list of country calling codes country calling codes or country dial in codes are telephone dialing prefixes for the member countries or regions of the international telecommunication union ( itu ) .
they are defined by the itu-t in standards e .
*num* and e .
*num* .
the prefixes enable international direct dialing ( idd ) , and are also referred to as " international subscriber dialing " ( isd ) codes .
country codes are a component of the international telephone numbering plan , and are necessary only when dialing a telephone number to establish a call to another country .
country codes are dialed before the national telephone number .
by convention , international telephone numbers are represented by prefixing the country code with a plus sign ( + ) , which also indicates to the subscriber that the local international call prefix must first be dialed .
for example , the international call prefix in all countries belonging to the north american numbering plan is *num* , while it is *num* in most european , asian and african countries .
on gsm ( cellular ) networks , the prefix may automatically be inserted when the user prefixes a dialed number with the plus sign .
country calling codes are prefix codes and can be organized as a tree .
in each row of the table , the country codes given in the left-most column share the same first digit ; then subsequent columns give the second digit in ascending order .
while there is a general geographic grouping to the zones , some exceptions exist for political and historical reasons .
thus , the geographical indicators below are approximations only .
member countries of the north american numbering plan ( nanp ) are assigned three-digit area codes under the common country prefix " *num* " , shown in the format " +1 xxx " .
the north american numbering plan includes : originally , larger countries such as spain , the united kingdom or france , were assigned two-digit codes to compensate for their usually longer domestic numbers .
small countries , such as iceland , were assigned three-digit codes .
since the 1980s , all new assignments have been three-digit regardless of countries’ populations .
bovril bovril is the trademarked name of a thick and salty meat extract paste similar to a yeast extract , developed in the 1870s by john lawson johnston .
it is sold in a distinctive , bulbous jar .
bovril is owned and distributed by unilever uk .
bovril can be made into a drink by diluting with hot water or , less commonly , with milk .
it can be used as a flavouring for soups , broth , stews or porridge , or as a spread , especially on toast in a similar fashion to marmite and vegemite .
the first part of the product's name comes from latin " bovīnus " , meaning " ox " .
johnston took the " -vril " suffix from edward bulwer-lytton's then-popular novel , " the coming race " ( *num* ) , whose plot revolves around a superior race of people , the vril-ya , who derive their powers from an electromagnetic substance named " vril " .
therefore , bovril indicates great strength obtained from an ox .
in *num* , in the franco-prussian war , napoleon iii ordered one million cans of beef to feed his troops .
the task of providing all this beef went to a scotsman living in canada named john lawson johnston .
large quantities of beef were available across the british dominions and south america , but its transport and storage were problematic .
therefore , johnston created a product known as ' johnston's fluid beef ' , later called bovril , to meet the needs of napoleon iii .
by *num* , over *num* , *num* uk public houses , grocers and dispensing chemists were selling bovril .
in *num* , the bovril company was formed .
bovril continued to function as a " war food " in world war i and was frequently mentioned in the *num* account " not so quiet .
.
.
stepdaughters of war " by helen zenna smith .
one account from the book describes it being prepared for the casualties at mons where " the orderlies were just beginning to make bovril for the wounded , when the bearers and ambulance wagons were shelled as they were bringing the wounded into the hospital " .
a thermos of " beef tea " was the favoured way to fend off the chill of winter matches for generations of british football fans ; bovril dissolved in hot water is still sold in stadiums all over the united kingdom .
bovril beef tea was the main warm drink that ernest shackleton's team had to drink when they were marooned on elephant island during the endurance expedition .
when john lawson johnston died , his son george lawson johnston inherited and took over the bovril business .
in *num* , george lawson johnston was created baron luke , of pavenham , in the county of bedford .
bovril's instant beef stock was launched in *num* and its " king of beef " range of instant flavours for stews , casseroles and gravy in *num* .
in *num* , cavenham foods acquired the bovril company but then sold most of its dairies and south american operations to finance further take-overs .
the brand is now owned by unilever .
bovril holds the unusual position of having been advertised with a pope .
an advertising campaign of the early *ord* century in britain depicted pope leo xiii seated on his throne , bearing a mug of bovril .
the campaign slogan read : " the two infallible powers – the pope & bovril .
" bovril is also produced in south africa by the bokomo division of pioneer foods .
during the siege of ladysmith in the second boer war , a bovril-like paste was produced from horse meat within the garrison .
nicknamed " chevril " ( a portmanteau of bovril and " cheval " , french for horse ) it was produced by boiling down horse or mule meat to a jelly paste and serving it as a " beef tea " .
in *num* , unilever removed beef ingredients from the bovril formula , rendering it vegetarian .
this was mainly due to concerns about decreasing sales , particularly from exports due to an export ban on british beef , as a result of the growing popularity of vegetarianism , religious dietary requirements , and public concerns about bovine spongiform encephalopathy .
in *num* , unilever reversed that decision and reintroduced beef ingredients to their bovril formula once sales increased and the beef export bans were lifted .
unilever now produces bovril using beef extract and a chicken variety using chicken extract .
since its invention , bovril has become an icon of british culture .
it is commonly associated with football culture , since during the winter british football fans in stadium terraces often drink it from thermos flasks or disposable cups in scotland , where thermoses are from football stadiums .
in the film " in which we serve " , the officers on the bridge are served " bovril heavily laced with sherry " to warm them up , after being rescued during the dunkirk evacuation of the british expeditionary force .
during a *num* episode of " top gear " , james may drank from an urn of bovril while driving a snowplough in norway and commented : " we all know that when it's snowing and it's cold you have bovril .
that's a rule of life .
" bovril reappeared in another episode of " top gear " in the form of jeremy clarkson's v8 food blender , wherein it was used to make a " man's v8 smoothie " complete with raw beef , chilies , hot sauce , and a brick .
on " frasier " in season *num* , episode *num* , daphne is upset when niles throws away a jar of bovril because it smelled rancid .
daphne exclaims : " that's how it's supposed to smell ; it's english ! " in steve coogan's *num* alan partridge mockumentary " scissored isles " , the partridge character offers bovril to some teenagers , telling them it's " basically beef tea .
" douglas adams , author of " the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy " , stated that he relied on frequent baths , bovril sandwiches and very loud guitar playing as excuses to avoid writing .
bluegrass bluegrass refers to several species of grasses of the genus " poa " ( with the most famous being the kentucky bluegrass ) .
foreign relations of georgia georgia's location , nestled between the black sea , russia , and turkey , renders it strategically important .
it is developing as the gateway from the black sea to the caucasus and the larger caspian region , but also serves as a buffer between russia and turkey .
georgia has a long and tumultuous relationship with russia , but it is reaching out to its other neighbours and looking to the west in search of alternatives and opportunities .
it signed a partnership and cooperation agreement with the european union , participates in the partnership for peace , and encourages foreign investment .
france , germany , south korea the united kingdom and the united states all have embassies in tbilisi .
georgia in 2004-2008 sought to become a member of nato , but did not succeed in the face of strong russian opposition .
georgia is a member of the united nations , the council of europe , and the osce .
because of its strategic location , georgia is in both the russian and american spheres of influence , however georgia's relationship with russia is at its lowest point since *num* due to controversies regarding espionage and the *num* south ossetia war .
as a result , georgia broke off diplomatic relations with russia and has left the commonwealth of independent states .
georgia has established relations with *num* countries , the vatican city , order of malta and palestine .
georgia has terminated its diplomatic relations with russia and nicaragua .
bijection in mathematics , a bijection , bijective function , or one-to-one correspondence is a function between the elements of two sets , where each element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the other set , and each element of the other set is paired with exactly one element of the first set .
there are no unpaired elements .
in mathematical terms , a bijective function " f " : " x " → " y " is a one-to-one ( injective ) and onto ( surjective ) mapping of a set " x " to a set " y " .
a bijection from the set " x " to the set " y " has an inverse function from " y " to " x " .
if " x " and " y " are finite sets , then the existence of a bijection means they have the same number of elements .
for infinite sets the picture is more complicated , leading to the concept of cardinal number , a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets .
a bijective function from a set to itself is also called a " permutation " .
bijective functions are essential to many areas of mathematics including the definitions of isomorphism , homeomorphism , diffeomorphism , permutation group , and projective map .
for a pairing between " x " and " y " ( where " y " need not be different from " x " ) to be a bijection , four properties must hold : satisfying properties ( *num* ) and ( *num* ) means that a bijection is a function with domain " x " .
it is more common to see properties ( *num* ) and ( *num* ) written as a single statement : every element of " x " is paired with exactly one element of " y " .
functions which satisfy property ( *num* ) are said to be " onto " y " " and are called surjections ( or surjective functions ) .
functions which satisfy property ( *num* ) are said to be " one-to-one functions " and are called injections ( or injective functions ) .
with this terminology , a bijection is a function which is both a surjection and an injection , or using other words , a bijection is a function which is both " one-to-one " and " onto " .
bijections are sometimes denoted by a two-headed rightwards arrow with tail ( ) , as in " f " : " x " ⤖ " y " .
this symbol is a combination of the two-headed rightwards arrow ( ) sometimes used to denote surjections and the rightwards arrow with a barbed tail ( ) sometimes used to denote injections .
consider the batting line-up of a baseball or cricket team ( or any list of all the players of any sports team where every player holds a specific spot in a line-up ) .
the set " x " will be the players on the team ( of size nine in the case of baseball ) and the set " y " will be the positions in the batting order ( *ord* , *ord* , *ord* , etc .
) the " pairing " is given by which player is in what position in this order .
property ( *num* ) is satisfied since each player is somewhere in the list .
property ( *num* ) is satisfied since no player bats in two ( or more ) positions in the order .
property ( *num* ) says that for each position in the order , there is some player batting in that position and property ( *num* ) states that two or more players are never batting in the same position in the list .
in a classroom there are a certain number of seats .
a bunch of students enter the room and the instructor asks them all to be seated .
after a quick look around the room , the instructor declares that there is a bijection between the set of students and the set of seats , where each student is paired with the seat they are sitting in .
what the instructor observed in order to reach this conclusion was that : the instructor was able to conclude that there were just as many seats as there were students , without having to count either set .
a bijection " f " with domain " x " ( indicated by " f " : " x → y " in functional notation ) also defines a converse relation starting in " y " and going to " x " ( by turning the arrows around ) .
the process of " turning the arrows around " for an arbitrary function does not , " in general " , yield a function , but properties ( *num* ) and ( *num* ) of a bijection say that this inverse relation is a function with domain " y " .
moreover , properties ( *num* ) and ( *num* ) then say that this inverse " function " is a surjection and an injection , that is , the inverse function exists and is also a bijection .
functions that have inverse functions are said to be invertible .
a function is invertible if and only if it is a bijection .
stated in concise mathematical notation , a function " f " : " x → y " is bijective if and only if it satisfies the condition continuing with the baseball batting line-up example , the function that is being defined takes as input the name of one of the players and outputs the position of that player in the batting order .
since this function is a bijection , it has an inverse function which takes as input a position in the batting order and outputs the player who will be batting in that position .
the composition formula_3 of two bijections " f " : " x → y " and " g " : " y → z " is a bijection .
the inverse of formula_3 is formula_5 .
conversely , if the composition formula_3 of two functions is bijective , we can only say that " f " is injective and " g " is surjective .
if " x " and " y " are finite sets , then there exists a bijection between the two sets " x " and " y " if and only if " x " and " y " have the same number of elements .
indeed , in axiomatic set theory , this is taken as the definition of " same number of elements " ( equinumerosity ) , and generalising this definition to infinite sets leads to the concept of cardinal number , a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets .
bijections are precisely the isomorphisms in the category set of sets and set functions .
however , the bijections are not always the isomorphisms for more complex categories .
for example , in the category grp of groups , the morphisms must be homomorphisms since they must preserve the group structure , so the isomorphisms are " group isomorphisms " which are bijective homomorphisms .
the notion of one-to-one correspondence generalizes to partial functions , where they are called partial bijections , although partial bijections are only required to be injective .
the reason for this relaxation is that a ( proper ) partial function is already undefined for a portion of its domain ; thus there is no compelling reason to constrain its inverse to be a total function , i .
e .
defined everywhere on its domain .
the set of all partial bijections on a given base set is called the symmetric inverse semigroup .
another way of defining the same notion is to say that a partial bijection from " a " to " b " is any relation "r " ( which turns out to be a partial function ) with the property that " r " is the graph of a bijection " f " : " a′"→"b′ " , where " a′ " is a subset of " a " and " b′ " is a subset of " b " .
when the partial bijection is on the same set , it is sometimes called a one-to-one partial transformation .
an example is the möbius transformation simply defined on the complex plane , rather than its completion to the extended complex plane .
this topic is a basic concept in set theory and can be found in any text which includes an introduction to set theory .

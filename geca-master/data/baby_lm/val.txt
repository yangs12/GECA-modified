beagle the beagle is a breed of small hound that is similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound .
the beagle is a scent hound , developed primarily for hunting hare ( beagling ) .
with a great sense of smell and superior tracking instinct , the beagle is employed as detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world .
the beagle is intelligent but single-minded .
it is a popular pet due to its size , good temper , and lack of inherited health problems .
although beagle-type dogs have existed for *num* , *num* years , the modern breed was developed in great britain around the 1830s from several breeds , including the talbot hound , the north country beagle , the southern hound , and possibly the harrier .
beagles have been depicted in popular culture since elizabethan times in literature and paintings , and more recently in film , television , and comic books .
snoopy of the comic strip " peanuts " has been called " the world's most famous beagle " .
dogs of similar size and purpose to the modern beagle can be traced in ancient greece back to around the *ord* century bc .
xenophon , born around *num* bc , in his " treatise on hunting " or " cynegeticus " refers to a hound that hunted hares by scent and was followed on foot .
small hounds are mentioned in the forest laws of canute which exempted them from the ordinance which commanded that all dogs capable of running down a stag should have one foot mutilated .
if genuine , these laws would confirm that beagle-type dogs were present in england before *num* , but it is likely the laws were written in the middle ages to give a sense of antiquity and tradition to forest law .
in the *ord* century , william the conqueror brought the talbot hound to britain .
the talbot was a predominantly white , slow , deep-throated , scent hound derived from the st .
hubert hound which had been developed in the *ord* century .
at some point the english talbots were crossed with greyhounds to give them an extra turn of speed .
long extinct , the talbot strain probably gave rise to the southern hound which , in turn , is thought to be an ancestor of the modern-day beagle .
from medieval times , " beagle " was used as a generic description for the smaller hounds , though these dogs differed considerably from the modern breed .
miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times of edward ii and henry vii , who both had packs of glove beagles , so named since they were small enough to fit on a glove , and queen elizabeth i kept a breed known as a pocket beagle , which stood at the shoulder .
small enough to fit in a " pocket " or saddlebag , they rode along on the hunt .
the larger hounds would run the prey to ground , then the hunters would release the small dogs to continue the chase through underbrush .
elizabeth i referred to the dogs as her " singing beagles " and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her pocket beagles cavort amid their plates and cups .
19th-century sources refer to these breeds interchangeably and it is possible that the two names refer to the same small variety .
in george jesse's " researches into the history of the british dog " from *num* , the early 17th-century poet and writer gervase markham is quoted referring to the beagle as small enough to sit on a man's hand and to the : standards for the pocket beagle were drawn up as late as *num* ; these genetic lines are now extinct , although modern breeders have attempted to recreate the variety .
by the *ord* century two breeds had been developed for hunting hare and rabbit : the southern hound and the north country beagle ( or northern hound ) .
the southern hound , a tall , heavy dog with a square head , and long , soft ears , was common from south of the river trent and probably closely related to the talbot hound .
though slow , it had stamina and an excellent scenting ability .
the north country beagle , possibly a cross between an offshoot of the talbot stock and a greyhound , was bred chiefly in yorkshire and was common in the northern counties .
it was smaller than the southern hound , less heavy-set and with a more pointed muzzle .
it was faster than its southern counterpart but its scenting abilities were less well developed .
as fox hunting became increasingly popular , numbers of both types of hound diminished .
the beagle-type dogs were crossed with larger breeds such as stag hounds to produce the modern foxhound .
the beagle-size varieties came close to extinction but some farmers in the south ensured the survival of the prototype breeds by maintaining small rabbit-hunting packs .
reverend phillip honeywood established a beagle pack in essex in the 1830s and it is believed that this pack formed the basis for the modern breed .
although details of the pack's lineage are not recorded it is thought that north country beagles and southern hounds were strongly represented ; william youatt suspected that harriers formed a good majority of the beagle's bloodline , but the origin of the harrier is itself obscure .
honeywood's beagles were small , standing at about at the shoulder , and pure white according to john mills ( writing in " the sportsman's library " in *num* ) .
prince albert and lord winterton also had beagle packs around this time , and royal favour no doubt led to some revival of interest in the breed , but honeywood's pack was regarded as the finest of the three .
although credited with the development of the modern breed , honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and it was left to thomas johnson to refine the breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters .
two strains were developed : the rough- and smooth-coated varieties .
the rough-coated beagle survived until the beginning of the *ord* century , and there were even records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as *num* , but this variety is now extinct , having probably been absorbed into the standard beagle bloodline .
in the 1840s , a standard beagle type was beginning to develop ; the distinction between the north country beagle and southern hound had been lost , but there was still a large variation in size , character , and reliability among the emerging packs .
in *num* , " stonehenge " ( the pseudonym of john henry walsh ) , writing in the " manual of british rural sports " , was still dividing beagles into four varieties : the medium beagle ; the dwarf or lapdog beagle ; the fox beagle ( a smaller , slower version of the foxhound ) ; and the rough-coated or terrier beagle , which he classified as a cross between any of the other varieties and one of the scottish terrier breeds .
stonehenge also gives the start of a standard description : by *num* the threat of extinction was on the wane : there were *num* beagle packs in england .
the beagle club was formed in *num* and the first standard drawn up at the same time .
the following year the association of masters of harriers and beagles was formed .
both organisations aimed to further the best interests of the breed , and both were keen to produce a standard type of beagle .
by *num* , the number of packs had risen to *num* .
beagles were in the united states by the 1840s at the latest , but the first dogs were imported strictly for hunting and were of variable quality .
since honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s , it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight-legged dachshunds with weak heads has little resemblance to the standard .
serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline began in the early 1870s when general richard rowett from illinois imported some dogs from england and began breeding .
rowett's beagles are believed to have formed the models for the first american standard , drawn up by rowett , l .
h .
twadell , and norman ellmore in *num* .
the beagle was accepted as a breed by the american kennel club ( akc ) in *num* .
in the *ord* century the breed has spread worldwide .
the average size of a beagle litter is six puppies .
when mother beagles give birth to litters of puppies , the little pups weigh just a few ounces each .
on its formation , the association of masters of harriers and beagles took over the running of a regular show at peterborough that had started in *num* , and the beagle club in the uk held its first show in *num* .
the regular showing of the breed led to the development of a uniform type , and the beagle continued to prove a success up until the outbreak of world war i when all shows were suspended .
after the war , the breed was again struggling for survival in the uk : the last of the pocket beagles was probably lost during this time , and registrations fell to an all-time low .
a few breeders ( notably reynalton kennels ) managed to revive interest in the dog and by world war ii , the breed was once again doing well .
registrations dropped again after the end of the war but almost immediately recovered .
as purebred dogs , beagles have always been more popular in the united states and canada than in their native country england .
the national beagle club of america was formed in *num* and by *num* a beagle had won a best in show title .
as in the uk , activity during world war i was minimal , but the breed showed a much stronger revival in the u .
s .
when hostilities ceased .
in *num* it won a number of prizes at the westminster kennel club's show and by *num* a beagle – champion meadowlark draughtsman – had captured the title of top-winning american-bred dog for the year .
on *num* february *num* , a beagle , k-run's park me in first ( uno ) , won the best in show category at the westminster kennel club show for the first time in the competition's history .
in north america they have been consistently in the top-ten most-popular breeds for over *num* years .
from *num* to *num* the beagle was ranked no .
*num* on the list of the american kennel club's registered breeds ; in *num* and *num* it ranked *ord* out of the *num* breeds registered .
in the uk they are not quite so popular , placing *ord* and *ord* in the rankings of registrations with the kennel club in *num* and *num* respectively .
in the united states the beagle ranked *ord* most popular breed in *num* and *num* , behind the labrador retriever ( #1 ) , german shepherd ( #2 ) and golden retriever ( #3 ) breeds .
according to the " oxford english dictionary " , the first mention of the beagle by name in english literature dates from c .
*num* in " the squire of low degree " .
the origin of the word " beagle " is uncertain , although it has been suggested that the word derives from the french " begueule " .
it is not known why the black and tan kerry beagle , present in ireland since celtic times , has the " beagle " description , since at it is significantly taller than the modern day beagle , and in earlier times was even larger .
some writers suggest that the beagle's scenting ability may have come from cross-breeding earlier strains with the kerry beagle .
originally used for hunting stags , it is today used for hare and drag hunting .
the general appearance of the beagle resembles a miniature foxhound , but the head is broader and the muzzle shorter , the expression completely different and the legs shorter in proportion to the body .
they are generally between high at the withers and weigh between , with females being slightly smaller than males on average .
they have a smooth , somewhat domed skull with a medium-length , square-cut muzzle and a black ( or occasionally liver ) gumdrop nose .
the jaw is strong and the teeth scissor together with the upper teeth fitting perfectly over the lower teeth and both sets aligned square to the jaw .
the eyes are large , hazel or brown , with a mild hound-like pleading look .
the large ears are long , soft and low-set , turning towards the cheeks slightly and rounded at the tips .
beagles have a strong , medium-length neck ( which is long enough for them to easily bend to the ground to pick up a scent ) , with little folding in the skin but some evidence of a dewlap ; a broad chest narrowing to a tapered abdomen and waist and a long , slightly curved tail ( known as the " stern " ) tipped with white .
the white tip , known as the flag has been selectively bred for , as it allows the dog to be easily seen when its head is down following a scent .
the tail does not curl over the back , but is held upright when the dog is active .
the beagle has a muscular body and a medium-length , smooth , hard coat .
the front legs are straight and carried under the body while the rear legs are muscular and well bent at the stifles .
the tricolored beaglewhite with large black areas and light brown shadingis the most common .
tricolored beagles occur in a number of shades , from the " classic tri " with a jet black saddle ( also known as " blackback " ) , to the " dark tri " ( where faint brown markings are intermingled with more prominent black markings ) , to the " faded tri " ( where faint black markings are intermingled with more prominent brown markings ) .
some tricolored dogs have a broken pattern , sometimes referred to as " pied " .
these dogs have mostly white coats with patches of black and brown hair .
tricolor beagles are almost always born black and white .
the white areas are typically set by eight weeks , but the black areas may fade to brown as the puppy matures .
( the brown may take between one and two years to fully develop .
) some beagles gradually change color during their lives , and may lose their black markings entirely .
two-color varieties always have a white base color with areas of the second color .
tan and white is the most common two-color variety , but there is a wide range of other colors including lemon , a very light tan ; red , a reddish , almost orange , brown ; and liver , a darker brown , and black .
liver is not common and is not permitted in some standards ; it tends to occur with yellow eyes .
ticked or mottled varieties may be either white or black with different colored flecks ( " ticking " ) , such as the blue-mottled or bluetick beagle , which has spots that appear to be a midnight-blue color , similar to the coloring of the bluetick coonhound .
some tricolor beagles also have ticking of various colors in their white areas .
alongside the bloodhound and basset hound , the beagle has one of the best developed senses of smell of any dog .
in the 1950s , john paul scott and john fuller began a 13-year study of canine behavior .
as part of this research , they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a one-acre field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it .
the beagles found it in less than a minute , while fox terriers took *num* minutes and scottish terriers failed to find it at all .
beagles are better at ground-scenting ( following a trail on the ground ) than they are at air-scenting , and for this reason they have been excluded from most mountain rescue teams in favor of collies , which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable .
the long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose .
the american kennel club recognizes two separate varieties of beagle : the 13-inch for hounds less than , and the 15-inch for those between .
the canadian kennel club recognizes a single type , with a height not exceeding .
the kennel club ( uk ) and fci affiliated clubs recognize a single type , with a height of between .
english and american varieties are sometimes mentioned .
however , there is no official recognition from any kennel club for this distinction .
beagles fitting the american kennel club standard – which disallows animals over – are smaller on average than those fitting the kennel club standard which allows heights up to .
pocket beagles are sometimes advertised for sale but while the uk kennel club originally specified a standard for the pocket beagle in *num* , the variety is now not recognized by any kennel club .
a strain known as patch hounds was developed by willet randall and his family from *num* specifically for their rabbit hunting ability .
they trace their bloodline back to field champion patch , but do not necessarily have a patchwork marking .
in the 1850s , stonehenge recommended a cross between a beagle and a scottish terrier as a retriever .
he found the crossbreed to be a good worker , silent and obedient , but it had the drawback that it was small and could barely carry a hare .
more recently the trend has been for " designer dogs " and one of the most popular has been the beagle / pug cross known as a puggle .
some puppies of this cross are less excitable than a beagle and with a lower exercise requirement , similar to the pug parent ; but many are highly excitable and require vigorous exercise .
the beagle has an even temper and gentle disposition .
described in several breed standards as " merry " , they are amiable and typically neither aggressive nor timid , although this depends on the individual .
they enjoy company , and although they may initially be standoffish with strangers , they are easily won over .
they make poor guard dogs for this reason , although their tendency to bark or howl when confronted with the unfamiliar makes them good watch dogs .
in a *num* study conducted by ben and lynette hart , the beagle was given the highest excitability rating , along with the yorkshire terrier , cairn terrier , miniature schnauzer , west highland white terrier , and fox terrier .
beagles are intelligent but , as a result of being bred for the long chase , are single-minded and determined , which can make them hard to train .
they can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent , and are easily distracted by smells around them .
they do not generally feature in obedience trials ; while they are alert , respond well to food-reward training , and are eager to please , they are easily bored or distracted .
they are ranked *ord* in stanley coren's " the intelligence of dogs " , as coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working / obedience intelligence .
coren's scale , however , does not assess understanding , independence , or creativity .
beagles are excellent with children and this is one of the reasons they have became popular family pets .
but as beagles are pack animals , they are prone to separation anxiety , a condition which causes them to destroy things when left unattended .
not all beagles will howl , but most will bark when confronted with strange situations , and some will bay ( also referred to as " speaking " , " giving tongue " , or " opening " ) when they catch the scent of potential quarry .
they also generally get along well with cats and other dogs .
they are not too demanding with regard to exercise ; their inbred stamina means they do not easily tire when exercised , but they also do not need to be worked to exhaustion before they will rest .
regular exercise helps ward off the weight gain to which the breed is prone .
the typical longevity of beagles is 12–15 years , which is a common lifespan for dogs of their size .
beagles may be prone to epilepsy , but this can often be controlled with medication .
hypothyroidism and a number of types of dwarfism occur in beagles .
two conditions in particular are unique to the breed : " funny puppy " , in which the puppy is slow to develop and eventually develops weak legs , a crooked back and although normally healthy , is prone to a range of illnesses ; hip dysplasia , common in harriers and in some larger breeds , is rarely considered a problem in beagles .
beagles are considered a chondrodystrophic breed , meaning that they are prone to types of disk diseases .
in rare cases , beagles may develop immune mediated polygenic arthritis ( where the immune system attacks the joints ) even at a young age .
the symptoms can sometimes be relieved by steroid treatments .
another rare disease in the breed is neonatal cerebellar cortical degeneration .
affected puppies are slow , have lower co-ordination , fall more often and don't have a normal gait .
it has an estimated carrier rate of *num* % and affected rate of *num* .
*num* % .
a genetic test is available .
their long floppy ears can mean that the inner ear does not receive a substantial air flow or that moist air becomes trapped , and this can lead to ear infections .
beagles may also be affected by a range of eye problems ; two common ophthalmic conditions in beagles are glaucoma and corneal dystrophy .
" cherry eye " , a prolapse of the gland of the third eyelid , and distichiasis , a condition in which eyelashes grow into the eye causing irritation , sometimes exist ; both these conditions can be corrected with surgery .
they can suffer from several types of retinal atrophy .
failure of the nasolacrimal drainage system can cause dry eye or leakage of tears onto the face .
as field dogs they are prone to minor injuries such as cuts and sprains , and , if inactive , obesity is a common problem as they will eat whenever food is available and rely on their owners to regulate their weight .
when working or running free they are also likely to pick up parasites such as fleas , ticks , harvest mites , and tapeworms , and irritants such as grass seeds can become trapped in their eyes , soft ears , or paws .
beagles may exhibit a behaviour known as reverse sneezing , in which they sound as if they are choking or gasping for breath , but are actually drawing air in through the mouth and nose .
the exact cause of this behaviour is not known , but it can be a common occurrence and is not harmful to the dog .
beagles were developed primarily for hunting hare , an activity known as beagling .
they were seen as ideal hunting companions for the elderly who could follow on horseback without exerting themselves , for young hunters who could keep up with them on ponies , and for the poorer hunters who could not afford to maintain a stable of good hunting horses .
before the advent of the fashion for foxhunting in the *ord* century , hunting was an all day event where the enjoyment was derived from the chase rather than the kill .
in this setting the tiny beagle was well matched to the hare , as unlike harriers they would not quickly finish the hunt , but because of their excellent scent-tracking skills and stamina they were almost guaranteed to eventually catch the hare .
the beagle packs would run closely together ( " so close that they might be covered with a sheet " ) which was useful in a long hunt , as it prevented stray dogs from obscuring the trail .
in thick undergrowth they were also preferred to spaniels when hunting pheasant .
with the fashion for faster hunts , the beagle fell out of favour for chasing hare , but was still employed for rabbit hunting .
in " anecdotes of dogs " ( *num* ) , edward jesse says : in the united states they appear to have been employed chiefly for hunting rabbits from the earliest imports .
hunting hare with beagles became popular again in britain in the *ord* century and continued until it was made illegal in scotland by the protection of wild mammals ( scotland ) act *num* and in england and wales by the hunting act *num* .
under this legislation beagles may still pursue rabbits with the landowner's permission .
drag hunting is popular where hunting is no longer permitted or for those owners who do not wish to participate in hunting a live animal , but still wish to exercise their dog's innate skills .
the traditional foot pack consists of up to *num* beagles , marshaled by a huntsman who directs the pack and who is assisted by a variable number of whippers-in whose job is to return straying hounds to the pack .
the master of the hunt is in overall day-to-day charge of the pack , and may or may not take on the role of huntsman on the day of the hunt .
as hunting with beagles was seen as ideal for young people , many of the british public schools traditionally maintained beagle packs .
protests were lodged against eton's use of beagles for hunting as early as *num* but the pack is still in existence today , and a pack used by imperial college in wye , kent was stolen by the animal liberation front in *num* .
school and university packs are still maintained by eton , marlborough , wye , radley , the royal agricultural university and christ church , oxford .
in addition to organized beagling , beagles have been used for hunting or flushing to guns ( often in pairs ) a wide range of game including snowshoe hare , cottontail rabbits , game birds , roe deer , red deer , bobcat , coyote , wild boar and foxes , and have even been recorded as being used to hunt stoat .
in most of these cases , the beagle is employed as a gun dog , flushing game for hunter's guns .
beagles are used as detection dogs in the beagle brigade of the united states department of agriculture .
these dogs are used to detect food items in luggage being taken into the united states .
after trialling several breeds , beagles were chosen because they are relatively small and unintimidating for people who are uncomfortable around dogs , easy to care for , intelligent and work well for rewards .
they are also used for this purpose in a number of other countries including by the ministry of agriculture and forestry in new zealand , the australian quarantine and inspection service , and in canada , japan and the people's republic of china .
larger breeds are generally used for detection of explosives as this often involves climbing over luggage and on large conveyor belts , work for which the smaller beagle is not suited .
beagles are the dog breed most often used in animal testing , due to their size and passive nature .
in the united states , as many as *num* , *num* beagles are used every year for medical , cosmetic , beauty , and other chemical tests .
they are purpose bred and live their lives in cages undergoing experiments .
the rescue + freedom project ( formerly beagle freedom project ) has successfully advocated for beagles to be released from labs .
this organization has freed hundreds of animals .
beagles are used in a range of research procedures : fundamental biological research , applied human medicine , applied veterinary medicine , and protection of man , animals or the environment .

testing of cosmetic products on animals is banned in the member states of the european community , although france protested the ban and has made efforts to have it lifted .
it is permitted in the united states but is not mandatory if safety can be ascertained by other methods , and the test species is not specified by the food and drug administration ( fda ) .
when testing toxicity of food additives , food contaminants , and some drugs and chemicals the fda uses beagles and miniature pigs as surrogates for direct human testing .

dynamic host configuration protocol the dynamic host configuration protocol ( dhcp ) is a network management protocol used on udp / ip networks whereby a dhcp server dynamically assigns an ip address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so they can communicate with other ip networks .
a dhcp server enables computers to request ip addresses and networking parameters automatically from the internet service provider ( isp ) , reducing the need for a network administrator or a user to manually assign ip addresses to all network devices .
in the absence of a dhcp server , a computer or other device on the network needs to be manually assigned an ip address , or to assign itself an apipa address , which will not enable it to communicate outside its local subnet .
dhcp can be implemented on networks ranging in size from home networks to large campus networks and regional internet service provider networks .
a router or a residential gateway can be enabled to act as a dhcp server .
most residential network routers receive a globally unique ip address within the isp network .
within a local network , a dhcp server assigns a local ip address to each device connected to the network .
udp / ip defines how devices on one network communicate with devices on another network , and the dhcp server can manage udp / ip settings for devices on a network , by automatically or dynamically assigning ip addresses to the devices .
the dhcp operates based on the client–server model .
when a computer or other device connects to a network , the dhcp client software sends a dhcp broadcast query requesting the necessary information .
any dhcp server on the network may service the request .
the dhcp server manages a pool of ip addresses and information about client configuration parameters such as default gateway , domain name , the name servers , and time servers .
on receiving a dhcp request , the dhcp server may respond with specific information for each client , as previously configured by an administrator , or with a specific address and any other information valid for the entire network and for the time period for which the allocation ( " lease " ) is valid .
a dhcp client typically queries for this information immediately after booting , and periodically thereafter before the expiration of the information .
when a dhcp client refreshes an assignment , it initially requests the same parameter values , but the dhcp server may assign a new address based on the assignment policies set by administrators .
on large networks that consist of multiple links , a single dhcp server may service the entire network when aided by dhcp relay agents located on the interconnecting routers .
such agents relay messages between dhcp clients and dhcp servers located on different subnets .
depending on implementation , the dhcp server may have three methods of allocating ip addresses : dhcp is used for internet protocol version *num* ( ipv4 ) and ipv6 .
while both versions serve the same purpose , the details of the protocol for ipv4 and ipv6 differ sufficiently that they may be considered separate protocols .
for the ipv6 operation , devices may alternatively use stateless address autoconfiguration .
ipv6 hosts may also use link-local addressing to achieve operations restricted to the local network link .
the dhcp employs a connectionless service model , using the user datagram protocol ( udp ) .
it is implemented with two udp port numbers for its operations which are the same as for the bootstrap protocol ( bootp ) .
udp port number *num* is the destination port of a server , and udp port number *num* is used by the client .
dhcp operations fall into four phases : server discovery , ip lease offer , ip lease request , and ip lease acknowledgement .
these stages are often abbreviated as dora for discovery , offer , request , and acknowledgement .
the dhcp operation begins with clients broadcasting a request .
if the client and server are on different subnets , a dhcp helper or dhcp relay agent may be used .
clients requesting renewal of an existing lease may communicate directly via udp unicast , since the client already has an established ip address at that point .
additionally , there is a broadcast flag ( *num* bit in *num* byte flags field , where all other bits are reserved and so are set to *num* ) the client can use to indicate in which way ( broadcast or unicast ) it can receive the dhcpoffer : 0x8000 for broadcast , 0x0000 for unicast .
usually , the dhcpoffer is sent through unicast .
for those hosts which cannot accept unicast packets before ip addresses are configured , this flag can be used to work around this issue .
the dhcp client broadcasts a dhcpdiscover message on the network subnet using the destination address *num* .
*num* .
*num* .
*num* ( limited broadcast ) or the specific subnet broadcast address ( directed broadcast ) .
a dhcp client may also request its last known ip address .
if the client remains connected to the same network , the server may grant the request .
otherwise , it depends whether the server is set up as authoritative or not .
an authoritative server denies the request , causing the client to issue a new request .
a non-authoritative server simply ignores the request , leading to an implementation-dependent timeout for the client to expire the request and ask for a new ip address .
for example , if htype is set to *num* , to specify that the medium used is ethernet , hlen is set to *num* because an ethernet address ( mac address ) is *num* octets long .
the chaddr is set to the mac address used by the client .
some options are set as well .
when a dhcp server receives a dhcpdiscover message from a client , which is an ip address lease request , the dhcp server reserves an ip address for the client and makes a lease offer by sending a dhcpoffer message to the client .
this message contains the client's client id ( traditionally a mac address ) , the ip address that the server is offering , the subnet mask , the lease duration , and the ip address of the dhcp server making the offer .
the dhcp server may also take notice of the hardware-level mac address in the underlying transport layer : according to current rfcs the transport layer mac address may be used if no client id is provided in the dhcp packet .
the dhcp server determines the configuration based on the client's hardware address as specified in the chaddr ( client hardware address ) field .
here the server , *num* .
*num* .
*num* .
*num* , specifies the client's ip address in the yiaddr ( your ip address ) field .
in response to the dhcp offer , the client replies with a dhcprequest message , broadcast to the server , requesting the offered address .
a client can receive dhcp offers from multiple servers , but it will accept only one dhcp offer .
based on required " server identification " option in the request and broadcast messaging , servers are informed whose offer the client has accepted .
when other dhcp servers receive this message , they withdraw any offers that they have made to the client and return the offered ip address to the pool of available addresses .
when the dhcp server receives the dhcprequest message from the client , the configuration process enters its final phase .
the acknowledgement phase involves sending a dhcpack packet to the client .
this packet includes the lease duration and any other configuration information that the client might have requested .
at this point , the ip configuration process is completed .
the protocol expects the dhcp client to configure its network interface with the negotiated parameters .
after the client obtains an ip address , it should probe the newly received address ( e .
g .
with arp address resolution protocol ) to prevent address conflicts caused by overlapping address pools of dhcp servers .
a dhcp client may request more information than the server sent with the original dhcpoffer .
the client may also request repeat data for a particular application .
for example , browsers use " dhcp inform " to obtain web proxy settings via .
the client sends a request to the dhcp server to release the dhcp information and the client deactivates its ip address .
as client devices usually do not know when users may unplug them from the network , the protocol does not mandate the sending of " dhcp release " .
a dhcp server can provide optional configuration parameters to the client .
rfc *num* describes the available dhcp options defined by internet assigned numbers authority ( iana ) - dhcp and bootp parameters .
a dhcp client can select , manipulate and overwrite parameters provided by a dhcp server .
in unix-like systems this client-level refinement typically takes place according to the values in the configuration file " / etc / dhclient .
conf " .
options are octet strings of varying length .
the first octet is the option code , the second octet is the number of following octets and the remaining octets are code dependent .
for example , the dhcp message-type option for an offer would appear as 0x35 , 0x01 , 0x02 , where 0x35 is code *num* for " dhcp message type " , 0x01 means one octet follows and 0x02 is the value of " offer " .
the following tables list the available dhcp options , as listed in rfc *num* and iana registry .
an option exists to identify the vendor and functionality of a dhcp client .
the information is a variable-length string of characters or octets which has a meaning specified by the vendor of the dhcp client .
one method that a dhcp client can utilize to communicate to the server that it is using a certain type of hardware or firmware is to set a value in its dhcp requests called the vendor class identifier ( vci ) ( option *num* ) .
this method allows a dhcp server to differentiate between the two kinds of client machines and process the requests from the two types of modems appropriately .
some types of set-top boxes also set the vci ( option *num* ) to inform the dhcp server about the hardware type and functionality of the device .
the value this option is set to gives the dhcp server a hint about any required extra information that this client needs in a dhcp response .
the relay agent information option ( option *num* ) specifies container for attaching sub-options to dhcp requests transmitted between a dhcp relay and a dhcp server .
in small networks , where only one ip subnet is being managed , dhcp clients communicate directly with dhcp servers .
however , dhcp servers can also provide ip addresses for multiple subnets .
in this case , a dhcp client that has not yet acquired an ip address cannot communicate directly with the dhcp server using ip routing , because it does not have a routable ip address , does not know the link layer address of a router and does not know the ip address of the dhcp server .
in order to allow dhcp clients on subnets not directly served by dhcp servers to communicate with dhcp servers , dhcp relay agents can be installed on these subnets .
the dhcp client broadcasts on the local link ; the relay agent receives the broadcast and transmits it to one or more dhcp servers using unicast .
the relay agent stores its own ip address in field " giaddr " field of the dhcp packet .
the dhcp server uses the giaddr-value to determine the subnet on which the relay agent received the broadcast , and allocates an ip address on that subnet .
when the dhcp server replies to the client , it sends the reply to the giaddr-address , again using unicast .
the relay agent then retransmits the response on the local network .
in this situation , the communication between the relay agent and the dhcp server typically uses both a source and destination udp port of *num* .
the dhcp ensures reliability in several ways : periodic renewal , rebinding , and failover .
dhcp clients are allocated leases that last for some period of time .
clients begin to attempt to renew their leases once half the lease interval has expired .
they do this by sending a unicast " dhcprequest " message to the dhcp server that granted the original lease .
if that server is down or unreachable , it will fail to respond to the " dhcprequest " .
however , in that case the client repeats the " dhcprequest " from time to time , so if the dhcp server comes back up or becomes reachable again , the dhcp client will succeed in contacting it and renew the lease .
if the dhcp server is unreachable for an extended period of time , the dhcp client will attempt to rebind , by broadcasting its " dhcprequest " rather than unicasting it .
because it is broadcast , the " dhcprequest " message will reach all available dhcp servers .
if some other dhcp server is able to renew the lease , it will do so at this time .
in order for rebinding to work , when the client successfully contacts a backup dhcp server , that server must have accurate information about the client's binding .
maintaining accurate binding information between two servers is a complicated problem ; if both servers are able to update the same lease database , there must be a mechanism to avoid conflicts between updates on the independent servers .
a proposal for implementing fault-tolerant dhcp servers was submitted to the internet engineering task force , but never formalized .
if rebinding fails , the lease will eventually expire .
when the lease expires , the client must stop using the ip address granted to it in its lease .
at that time it will restart the dhcp process from the beginning by broadcasting a codice_1 message .
since its lease has expired , it will accept any ip address offered to it .
once it has a new ip address ( presumably from a different dhcp server ) it will once again be able to use the network .
however , since its ip address has changed , any ongoing connections will be broken .
the base dhcp does not include any mechanism for authentication .
because of this , it is vulnerable to a variety of attacks .
these attacks fall into three main categories : because the client has no way to validate the identity of a dhcp server , unauthorized dhcp servers ( commonly called " rogue dhcp " ) can be operated on networks , providing incorrect information to dhcp clients .
this can serve either as a denial-of-service attack , preventing the client from gaining access to network connectivity , or as a man-in-the-middle attack .
because the dhcp server provides the dhcp client with server ip addresses , such as the ip address of one or more dns servers , an attacker can convince a dhcp client to do its dns lookups through its own dns server , and can therefore provide its own answers to dns queries from the client .
this in turn allows the attacker to redirect network traffic through itself , allowing it to eavesdrop on connections between the client and network servers it contacts , or to simply replace those network servers with its own .
because the dhcp server has no secure mechanism for authenticating the client , clients can gain unauthorized access to ip addresses by presenting credentials , such as client identifiers , that belong to other dhcp clients .
this also allows dhcp clients to exhaust the dhcp server's store of ip addresses—by presenting new credentials each time it asks for an address , the client can consume all the available ip addresses on a particular network link , preventing other dhcp clients from getting service .
dhcp does provide some mechanisms for mitigating these problems .
the relay agent information option protocol extension ( rfc *num* , usually referred to in the industry by its actual number as " option *num* " ) allows network operators to attach tags to dhcp messages as these messages arrive on the network operator's trusted network .
this tag is then used as an authorization token to control the client's access to network resources .
because the client has no access to the network upstream of the relay agent , the lack of authentication does not prevent the dhcp server operator from relying on the authorization token .
another extension , authentication for dhcp messages ( rfc *num* ) , provides a mechanism for authenticating dhcp messages .
as of *num* , / had not seen widespread adoption because of the problems of managing keys for large numbers of dhcp clients .
a *num* book about dsl technologies remarked that : there were numerous security vulnerabilities identified against the security measures proposed by rfc *num* .
this fact , combined with the introduction of *num* .
1x , slowed the deployment and take-rate of authenticated dhcp , and it has never been widely deployed .
a *num* book notes that : [ t ] here have been very few implementations of dhcp authentication .
the challenges of key management and processing delays due to hash computation have been deemed too heavy a price to pay for the perceived benefits .
architectural proposals from *num* involve authenticating dhcp requests using *num* .
1x or pana ( both of which transport eap ) .
an ietf proposal was made for including eap in dhcp itself , the so-called eapodhcp ; this does not appear to have progressed beyond ietf draft level , the last of which dates to *num* .
existence existence is an ontological property of being , referring to the ability of an entity to , directly or indirectly , interact with the physical reality .
materialism holds that the only things that exist are matter and energy , that all things are composed of material , that all actions require energy , and that all phenomena ( including consciousness ) are the result of material interactions .
dialectical materialism does not make a distinction between being and existence , and defines it as the objective reality of various forms of matter .
idealism holds that the only things that properly exist are thoughts and ideas , while the material world is secondary .
in idealism , existence is sometimes contrasted with transcendence , the ability to go beyond the limits of existence .
as a form of epistemological idealism , rationalism interprets existence as cognizable and rational , all things as composed of strings of reasoning , requiring an associated idea of the thing , and all phenomena ( including consciousness ) as the result of an understanding of the imprint from the noumenal world in which lies beyond the thing-in-itself .
in scholasticism , existence of a thing is not derived from its essence and is determined by the creative volition of god , the dichotomy of existence and essence demonstrates that the dualism of the created universe is only resolvable through god .
empiricism recognizes existence of singular facts , which are not derivable and which are observable through empirical knowledge .
the exact definition of existence is one of the most important and fundamental topics of ontology , the philosophical study of the nature of being , existence , or reality in general , as well as of the basic categories of being and their relations .
traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics , ontology deals with questions concerning what things or entities exist or can be said to exist , and how such things or entities can be grouped , related within a hierarchy , and subdivided according to similarities and differences .
the word " existence " comes from the latin word " exsistere " meaning " to appear " , " to arise " , " to become " , or " to be " , but literally , it means " to stand out " ( " ex- " being the latin prefix for " out " added to the causative of the verb " stare " , meaning " to stand " ) .
in a technical sense , this refers to " standing out " of both being and becoming , thus having the qualities of both .
in the western tradition of philosophy , the earliest known comprehensive treatments of the subject are from plato's " phaedo " , " republic " , and " statesman " and aristotle's " metaphysics " , though earlier fragmentary writing exists .
aristotle developed a comprehensive theory of being , according to which only individual things , called substances , fully have to be , but other things such as relations , quantity , time , and place ( called the categories ) have a derivative kind of being , dependent on individual things .
in aristotle's " metaphysics " , there are four causes of existence or change in nature : the material cause , the formal cause , the efficient cause and the final cause .
the neo-platonists and some early christian philosophers argued about whether existence had any reality except in the mind of god .
some taught that existence was a snare and a delusion , that the world , the flesh , and the devil existed only to tempt weak humankind away from god .
the medieval philosopher thomas aquinas argued that god is pure being , and that in god essence and existence are the same .
at about the same time , the nominalist philosopher william of ockham argued , in book i of his " summa totius logicae " ( " treatise on all logic " , written some time before *num* ) , that categories are not a form of being in their own right , but derivative on the existence of individuals .
the early modern treatment of the subject derives from antoine arnauld and pierre nicole's " logic " , or " the art of thinking " , better known as the " port-royal logic " , first published in *num* .
arnauld thought that a proposition or judgment consists of taking two different ideas and either putting them together or rejecting them : the two terms are joined by the verb " is " ( or " is not " , if the predicate is denied of the subject ) .
thus every proposition has three components : the two terms , and the " copula " that connects or separates them .
even when the proposition has only two words , the three terms are still there .
for example , " god loves humanity " , really means " god is a lover of humanity " , " god exists " means " god is a thing " .
this theory of judgment dominated logic for centuries , but it has some obvious difficulties : it only considers proposition of the form " all a are b .
" , a form logicians call universal .
it does not allow propositions of the form " some a are b " , a form logicians call existential .
if neither a nor b includes the idea of existence , then " some a are b " simply adjoins a to b .
conversely , if a or b do include the idea of existence in the way that " triangle " contains the idea " three angles equal to two right angles " , then " a exists " is automatically true , and we have an ontological proof of a's existence .
( indeed , arnauld's contemporary descartes famously argued so , regarding the concept " god " ( discourse *num* , meditation *num* ) ) .
arnauld's theory was current until the middle of the nineteenth century .
david hume argued that the claim that a thing exists , when added to our notion of a thing , does not add anything to the concept .
for example , if we form a complete notion of moses , and superadd to that notion the claim that moses existed , we are not adding anything to the notion of moses .
kant also argued that existence is not a " real " predicate , but gave no explanation of how this is possible .
indeed , his famous discussion of the subject is merely a restatement of arnauld's doctrine that in the proposition " god is omnipotent " , the verb " is " signifies the joining or separating of two concepts such as " god " and " omnipotence " .
schopenhauer claimed that “everything that exists for knowledge , and hence the whole of this world , only object in relation to the subject , the perception of the perceiver , in a word , representation .
” according to him there can be " no object without subject " because " everything objective is already conditioned as such in manifold ways by the knowing subject with the forms of its knowing , and presupposes these forms .
.
.
" john stuart mill ( and also kant's pupil herbart ) argued that the predicative nature of existence was proved by sentences like " a centaur is a poetic fiction " or " a greatest number is impossible " ( herbart ) .
franz brentano challenged this ; so also ( as is better known ) did frege .
brentano argued that we can join the concept represented by a noun phrase " an a " to the concept represented by an adjective " b " to give the concept represented by the noun phrase " a b-a " .
for example , we can join " a man " to " wise " to give " a wise man " .
but the noun phrase " a wise man " is not a sentence , whereas " some man is wise " is a sentence .
hence the copula must do more than merely join or separate concepts .
furthermore , adding " exists " to " a wise man " , to give the complete sentence " a wise man exists " has the same effect as joining " some man " to " wise " using the copula .
so the copula has the same effect as " exists " .
brentano argued that every categorical proposition can be translated into an existential one without change in meaning and that the " exists " and " does not exist " of the existential proposition take the place of the copula .
he showed this by the following examples : frege developed a similar view ( though later ) in his great work " the foundations of arithmetic " , as did charles sanders peirce ( but peirce held that ) .
the frege-brentano view is the basis of the dominant position in modern anglo-american philosophy : that existence is asserted by the existential quantifier ( as expressed by quine's slogan " to be is to be the value of a variable .
" — " on what there is " , *num* ) .
in mathematical logic , there are two quantifiers , " some " and " all " , though as brentano ( 1838–1917 ) pointed out , we can make do with just one quantifier and negation .
the first of these quantifiers , " some " , is also expressed as " there exists " .
thus , in the sentence " there exists a man " , the term " man " is asserted to be part of existence .
but we can also assert , " there exists a triangle .
" is a " triangle " — an abstract idea — part of existence in the same way that a " man " — a physical body — is part of existence ? do abstractions such as goodness , blindness , and virtue exist in the same sense that chairs , tables , and houses exist ? what categories , or kinds of thing , can be the subject or the predicate of a proposition ? worse , does " existence " exist ? in some statements , existence is implied without being mentioned .
the statement " a bridge crosses the thames at hammersmith " cannot just be about a bridge , the thames , and hammersmith .
it must be about " existence " as well .
on the other hand , the statement " a bridge crosses the styx at limbo " has the same form , but while in the first case we understand a real bridge in the real world made of stone or brick , what " existence " would mean in the second case is less clear .
the nominalist approach is to argue that certain noun phrases can be " eliminated " by rewriting a sentence in a form that has the same meaning but does not contain the noun phrase .
thus ockham argued that " socrates has wisdom " , which apparently asserts the existence of a reference for " wisdom " , can be rewritten as " socrates is wise " , which contains only the referring phrase " socrates " .
this method became widely accepted in the twentieth century by the analytic school of philosophy .
however , this argument may be inverted by realists in arguing that since the sentence " socrates is wise " can be rewritten as " socrates has wisdom " , this proves the existence of a hidden referent for " wise " .
a further problem is that human beings seem to process information about fictional characters in much the same way that they process information about real people .
for example , in the *num* united states presidential election , a politician and actor named fred thompson ran for the republican party nomination .
in polls , potential voters identified fred thompson as a " law and order " candidate .
thompson plays a fictional character on the television series " law and order " .
the people who make the comment are aware that " law and order " is fiction , but at some level , they may process fiction as if it were fact , a process included in what is called the paradox of fiction .
another example of this is the common experience of actresses who play the villain in a soap opera being accosted in public as if they are to blame for the actions of the characters they play .
a scientist might make a clear distinction between objects that exist , and assert that all objects that exist are made up of either matter or energy .
but in the layperson's worldview , existence includes real , fictional , and even contradictory objects .
thus if we reason from the statement " pegasus flies " to the statement " pegasus exists " , we are not asserting that pegasus is made up of atoms , but rather that pegasus exists in the worldview of classical myth .
when a mathematician reasons from the statement " abc is a triangle " to the statement " triangles exist " , she is not asserting that triangles are made up of atoms but rather that triangles exist within a particular mathematical model .
according to bertrand russell's theory of descriptions , the negation operator in a singular sentence can take either wide or narrow scope : we distinguish between " some s is not p " ( where negation takes " narrow scope " ) and " it is not the case that ' some s is p' " ( where negation takes " wide scope " ) .
the problem with this view is that there appears to be no such scope distinction in the case of proper names .
the sentences " socrates is not bald " and " it is not the case that socrates is bald " both appear to have the same meaning , and they both appear to assert or presuppose the existence of someone ( socrates ) who is not bald , so that negation takes a narrow scope .
however , russell's theory analyses proper names into a logical structure which makes sense of this problem .
according to russell , socrates can be analyzed into the form ' the philosopher of greece .
' in the wide scope , this would then read : it is not the case that there existed a philosopher of greece who was bald .
in the narrow scope , it would read the philosopher of greece was not bald .
according to the direct-reference view , an early version of which was originally proposed by bertrand russell , and perhaps earlier by gottlob frege , a proper name strictly has no meaning when there is no object to which it refers .
this view relies on the argument that the semantic function of a proper name is to tell us " which " object bears the name , and thus to identify some object .
but no object can be identified if none exists .
thus , a proper name must have a bearer if it is to be meaningful .
according to the " two sense " view of existence , which derives from alexius meinong , existential statements fall into two classes .
the problem is then evaded as follows .
" pegasus flies " implies existence in the wide sense , for it implies that " something " flies .
but it does not imply existence in the narrow sense , for we deny existence in this sense by saying that pegasus does not exist .
in effect , the world of all things divides , on this view , into those ( like socrates , the planet venus , and new york city ) that have existed in the narrow sense , and those ( like sherlock holmes , the goddess venus , and minas tirith ) that do not .
however , common sense suggests the non-existence of such things as fictional characters or places .
influenced by the views of brentano's pupil alexius meinong , and by edmund husserl , germanophone and francophone philosophy took a different direction regarding the question of existence .
anti-realism is the view of idealists who are skeptics about the physical world , maintaining either : ( *num* ) that nothing exists outside the mind , or ( *num* ) that we would have no access to a mind-independent reality even if it may exist .
realists , in contrast , hold that perceptions or sense data are caused by mind-independent objects .
an " anti-realist " who denies that other minds exist ( i .
e .
, a solipsist ) is different from an " anti-realist " who claims that there is no fact of the matter as to whether or not there are unobservable other minds ( i .
e .
, a logical behaviorist ) .
the indian philosopher nagarjuna ( c .
150–250 ce ) largely advanced existence concepts and founded the madhyamaka school of mahāyāna buddhism .
in eastern philosophy , anicca ( sanskrit " anitya " ) or " impermanence " describes existence .
it refers to the fact that all conditioned things ( sankhara ) are in a constant state of flux .
in reality there is no thing that ultimately ceases to exist ; only the appearance of a thing ceases as it changes from one form to another .
imagine a leaf that falls to the ground and decomposes .
while the appearance and relative existence of the leaf ceases , the components that formed the leaf become particulate material that goes on to form new plants .
buddhism teaches a middle way , avoiding the extreme views of eternalism and nihilism .
the middle way recognizes there are vast differences between the way things are perceived to exist and the way things really exist .
the differences are reconciled in the concept of shunyata by addressing the existing object's served purpose for the subject's identity in being .
what exists is in non-existence , because the subject changes .
trailokya elaborates on three kinds of existence , those of desire , form , and formlessness in which there are karmic rebirths .
taken further to the trikaya doctrine , it describes how the buddha exists .
in this philosophy , it is accepted that buddha exists in more than one absolute way .
economy of cuba cuba has a planned economy dominated by state-run enterprises .
most industries are owned and operated by the government and most of the labor force is employed by the state .
following the fall of the soviet union , the communist party encouraged the formation of worker co-operatives and self-employment .
in the year *num* , public sector employment was *num* % and private sector employment , mainly composed of self-employment , was *num* % compared to the *num* ratio of *num* % to *num* % .
investment is restricted and requires approval by the government .
the government sets most prices and rations goods to citizens .
in *num* , cuba ranked *ord* out of *num* countries with a human development index of *num* .

housing and transportation costs are low .
cubans receive government subsidized education , health care and food subsidies .
the country achieved a more even distribution of income since the cuban revolution , which was followed by an economic embargo by the united states .
following the collapse of the soviet union , cuba's gdp declined by *num* % between *num* and *num* , partially due to loss of soviet subsidies and to a crash in sugar prices in the early 1990s .
cuba retains high levels of healthcare and education .
although cuba belonged to the high-income countries of latin america since the 1870s , income inequality was high , accompanied by capital outflows to foreign investors .
the country's economy had grown rapidly in the early part of the century , fueled by the sale of sugar to the united states .
prior to the cuban revolution , cuba ranked fifth in the hemisphere in per capita income , third in life expectancy , second in per capita ownership of automobiles and telephones , first in the number of television sets per inhabitant .
its income per capita in *num* was reportedly *num* % of the u .
s .

its proximity to the united states made it a familiar holiday destination for wealthy americans .
their visits for gambling , horse racing and golfing made tourism an important economic sector .
tourism magazine " cabaret quarterly " described havana as " a mistress of pleasure , the lush and opulent goddess of delights .
" according to perez , " havana was then what las vegas has become .
" cuban dictator fulgencio batista had plans to line the malecon , havana's famous walkway by the water , with hotels and casinos to attract even more tourists .
today hotel havana riviera is the only hotel that was built before the revolutionary government took control .
cuba had a one-crop economy ( sugar cane ) whose domestic market was constricted .
its population was characterized by chronic unemployment and deep poverty .
united states monopolies like bethlehem steel corporation and speyer gained control over valuable national resources .

the gains from these investments were reaped by american businessmen leading to discontent among the cuban people .
in the 1950s , most cuban children were not in school .
*num* percent of urban homes had electricity , but only *num* percent of rural homes did .
only *num* percent of rural homes had running water .
nearly half the rural population was illiterate as was about *num* percent of the total population .
poverty and unemployment in rural areas triggered migration to havana .
more than *num* percent of the cuban workforce in *num* were either underemployed or unemployed .
public education in cuba has always been free .
after passing the required entrance examination to your particular course of study , even attendance at the university of havana was tuition free , except for the cost of books .
after the cuban revolution , the new government placed the reconstruction of the education system along marxist ideological lines as a top priority .
on march *num* , *num* , fidel castro seized control of the cuban telephone company , which was a subsidiary of the international telephone and telecommunications corporation .
this was the first of many nationalizations made by the new government , the assets seized totaled *num* billion usd .
after the *num* revolution , citizens were not required to pay a personal income tax ( their salaries being regarded as net of any taxes ) .
the government also began to subsidize healthcare and education for all citizens ; this action created strong national support for the new revolutionary government .
after the ussr and cuba reestablished their diplomatic relations in may *num* , the ussr began to buy cuban sugar in exchange for oil .
when oil refineries like , shell , texaco , and esso refused to refine soviet oil , castro nationalized that industry as well , taking over the refineries on the island .
days later in response , the united states cut the cuban sugar quota completely , eisenhower was quoted saying " this action amounts to economic sanctions against , cuba .
now we must look ahead to other moves - economic , diplomatic , and strategic " .
on february *num* , *num* , kennedy expanded the united states ' embargo to cover almost all u .

in *num* , fidel castro attempted to motivate the cuban people to harvest *num* million tons of sugar , in spanish known as la zafra , in order to increase their exports and grow their economy .
with the help of the majority of the cuban population the country was able to produce *num* .
*num* million tons of sugar .
in july *num* , after the harvest was over , castro took responsibility for the failure and later that same year he blamed the sugar industry minister saying “those technocrats , geniuses , super-scientists assured me that they knew what to do in order to produce the ten million tons .
but it was proven , first , that they did not know how to do it and , second , that they exploited the rest of the economy by receiving large amounts of resources .
.
.
while there are factories that could have improved with a better distribution of those resources that were allocated to the ten-million-ton plan” .
during the revolutionary period cuba was one of the few developing countries to provide foreign aid to other countries .
foreign aid began with the construction of six hospitals in peru in the early 1970s .
it expanded later in the 1970s to the point where some *num* cubans worked in overseas assignments .
cubans built housing , roads , airports , schools and other facilities in angola , ethiopia , laos , guinea , tanzania and other countries .
by the end of *num* , *num* , *num* cuban workers had helped build projects in some *num* asian , african and latin american countries .
for nicaragua in *num* , cuba pledged to provide over $130 million worth of agricultural and machinery equipment , as well as some *num* technicians , doctors and teachers .
in *num* cuba defaulted on its $10 .
*num* billion debt to the paris club .
in *num* cuba stopped making payments on that debt .
in *num* cuba defaulted on $750 million in japanese loans .
although the soviet union offered subsidies to cuba beginning shortly after the revolution , comparative economic data from *num* showed that the amount of soviet aid was in line with the amount of western aid to other latin american countries .
the cuban gross domestic product declined at least *num* % between *num* and *num* due to the loss of *num* % of its trading partners and soviet subsidies .
this loss of subsidies coincided with a collapse in world sugar prices .
sugar had done well from 1985–90 and crashed precipitously in 1990–91 and did not recover for five years .
cuba had been insulated from world sugar prices by soviet price guarantees .
however , the cuban economy began to boost again following a rapid improvement in trade and diplomatic relations between cuba and venezuela following the election of hugo chavez in venezuela in *num* , who became cuba's most important trading partner and diplomatic ally .
this era was referred to as the " special period in peacetime " later shortened to " special period " .
a " canadian medical association journal " paper claimed that " the famine in cuba during the special period was caused by political and economic factors similar to the ones that caused a famine in north korea in the mid-1990s , on the grounds that both countries were run by authoritarian regimes that denied ordinary people the food to which they were entitled to when the public food distribution collapsed and priority was given to the elite classes and the military .
" other reports painted an equally dismal picture , describing cubans having to resort to eating anything they could find , from havana zoo animals to domestic cats .
but although the collapse of centrally planned economies in the soviet union and other countries of the eastern bloc subjected cuba to severe economic difficulties , which led to a drop in calories per day from *num* in *num* to *num* in *num* , mortality rates were not strongly affected thanks to the priority given on maintaining a social safety net .
the government undertook several reforms to stem excess liquidity , increase labor incentives and alleviate serious shortages of food , consumer goods and services .
to alleviate the economic crisis , the government introduced a few market-oriented reforms including opening to tourism , allowing foreign investment , legalizing the u .
s .
dollar and authorizing self-employment for some *num* occupations .
( this policy was later partially reversed , so that while the u .
s .
dollar is no longer accepted in businesses , it remains legal for cubans to hold the currency .
) these measures resulted in modest economic growth .
the liberalized agricultural markets introduced in october *num* , at which state and private farmers sell above-quota production at free market prices , broadened legal consumption alternatives and reduced black market prices .
government efforts to lower subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink the money supply caused the semi-official exchange rate for the cuban peso to move from a peak of *num* to the dollar in the summer of *num* to *num* to the dollar by year-end *num* .
the drop in gdp apparently halted in *num* , when cuba reported *num* .
*num* % growth , followed by increases of *num* .
*num* % in *num* and *num* .
*num* % in *num* .
growth slowed again in *num* and *num* to *num* .
*num* % and *num* .
*num* % respectively .
one of the key reasons given was the failure to notice that sugar production had become uneconomic .
reflecting on the special period cuban president fidel castro later admitted that many mistakes had been made , " the country had many economists and it is not my intention to criticize them , but i would like to ask why we hadn’t discovered earlier that maintaining our levels of sugar production would be impossible .
the soviet union had collapsed , oil was costing $40 a barrel , sugar prices were at basement levels , so why did we not rationalize the industry ? " living conditions in *num* remained well below the *num* level .
due to the continued growth of tourism , growth began in *num* with a *num* .
*num* % increase in gdp .
growth then picked up , with a growth in gdp of *num* .
*num* % in *num* according to government figures .
in *num* the cuban economy grew by *num* .
*num* % , higher than the latin american average .
accordingly , the cumulative growth in gdp since *num* stood at *num* .
*num* % .
however , from *num* , the state started to impose income taxes on self-employed cubans .
cuba ranked third in the region in *num* in gdp per capita , surpassed only by venezuela and uruguay .
it had descended to *ord* , *ord* or *ord* place in the region by *num* .
cuban social indicators suffered less .
every year the united nation holds a vote asking countries to choose if the united states is justified in their economic embargo against cuba and whether it should be lifted .
*num* was the first year that the united states abstained from the vote , rather than voting no , " since *num* the us and israel have constantly voted against the resolution – occasionally supported by the marshall islands , palau , uzbekistan , albania and romania " .
in *num* , " the new economic reforms were introduced , effectively creating a new economic system , referred by some as the " new cuban economy " since then , over four hundred thousand cubans have signed up to be entrepreneurs .
as of *num* , the government lists *num* official jobs no longer under their control—such as taxi driver , construction worker and shopkeeper .
workers may purchase licenses to work as a mule driver , palm tree trimmer , well-digger , button covered and " dandy"—gentleman in traditional elegant white suit and hat .
despite these openings cuba maintains nationalized companies for the distribution of all essential amenities ( water , power , .
.
.
) and other essential services to ensure a healthy population ( education , health care ) .
imports were double exports and doctors earned £15 per month .
families supplement incomes with extra jobs .
after *num* , half the country's sugar mills closed and tourists now ride factory steam locomotives .
more than *num* , *num* farmers lease land from the government for bonus crops .
before , home-owners were allowed to swap properties ; legalized buying and selling then created a real-estate boom .
in *num* a havana fast-food burger pizza restaurant , la pachanga , started in the owner's home , serves *num* , *num* meals on a saturday at £3 , the weekly government wage .
in *num* , raúl castro's administration hinted that the purchase of computers , dvd players and microwaves would become legal .
however , monthly wages remain less than *num* u .
s .
dollars .
mobile phones , which had been restricted to cubans working for foreign companies and government officials , were legalized in *num* .
in *num* , fidel castro , in agreement with raúl castro's reformist sentiment , admitted that the cuban model based on the old soviet model of centralized planning was no longer sustainable .
they encouraged the creation of a co-operative variant of socialism where the state plays a less active role in the economy and the formation of worker-owned co-operatives and self-employment enterprises .
to remedy cuba's economic structural distortions and inefficiencies , the sixth congress approved expansion of the internal market and access to global markets on april *num* , *num* .
a comprehensive list of changes is : on december *num* , *num* a new credit policy allowed cuban banks to finance entrepreneurs and individuals wishing to make major purchases to do home improvements in addition to farmers .
" cuban banks have long provided loans to farm cooperatives , they have offered credit to new recipients of farmland in usufruct since *num* and in *num* they began making loans to individuals for business and other purposes " .
the system of rationed food distribution known in cuba was known as the " libreta de abastecimiento " ( " supplies booklet " ) .
as of *num* ration books at bodegas still procured rice , oil , sugar and matches , above government average wage £15 monthly .
raul castro signed law *num* in september *num* in order to create a special economic zone in the port city of mariel , the first in the country .
on *num* october *num* the dual currency system was set to be ended eventually .
as of *num* , the dual currency was still being used in cuba .
as of *num* , *num* % of electricity was produced from fossil fuels .
solar panels were introduced in some rural areas to reduce blackouts , brownouts and use of kerosene .
citizens were encouraged to swap inefficient lamps with newer models to reduce consumption .
a power tariff reduced inefficient use as of august *num* , off-shore petroleum exploration of promising formations in the gulf of mexico had been unproductive with two failures reported .
additional exploration is planned .
in *num* , cuba produced an estimated *num* .
*num* billion kwh of electricity and consumed *num* .
*num* billion kwh with no exports or imports .
in a *num* estimate , *num* .
*num* % of its energy production is fossil fuel , *num* .
*num* % is hydroelectric and *num* .
*num* % is other production .
in both *num* and *num* estimates , the country produced *num* , *num* bbl / d of oil and consumes *num* , *num* bbl / d with *num* , *num* bbl / d of imports , as well as *num* , *num* , *num* bbl proved reserves of oil .
venezuela is cuba's primary source of oil .
in *num* , cuba produced and consumed an estimated *num* million cu m of natural gas , with no cu m of exports or imports and *num* .
*num* billion cu m of proved reserves .
the energy revolution is a program executed by cuba in *num* .
this program focused on developing the country's socio-economic status and transition cuba into an energy-efficient economy with diverse energy resources .
cuba's energy sector lacks the resources to produce optimal amounts of power .
in fact , one of the issues the energy revolution program faces comes from cuba's power production suffering from the absence of investment and the ongoing trade sanctions imposed by the united states .
likewise , the energy sector has received a multimillion-dollar investment distributed among a network of power resources .
however , customers are experiencing rolling blackouts of power from energy companies in order to preserve electricity during cuba's economic crisis .
furthermore , an outdated electricity grid that's been damaged by hard hitting hurricanes , caused the energy crisis in *num* and continued to be a major issue during the energy revolution .
cuba responded to this situation by providing a variety of different types of energy resources .
in fact , *num* small diesel generators , *num* fuel oil generators , *num* diesel generators , *num* .
*num* million incandescent bulbs for energy saving lamps , *num* .
*num* million fans , *num* .
*num* million electric pressure cookers , *num* .
*num* million electric rice cookers , *num* .
*num* million electric water pumps , *num* .
*num* million domestic refrigerators and *num* .
*num* million televisions were distributed among territories .
the electrical grid was restored to only *num* % until *num* .
alternative energy has emerged as a major priority as the government has promoted wind and solar power .
the crucial challenge the energy revolution program will face is developing sustainable energy in cuba but , take into account a country that's continuing to develop , an economic sanction and the detrimental effects of hurricanes that hit this country .
cuba produces sugarcane , tobacco , citrus , coffee , rice , potatoes , beans and livestock .
as of *num* cuba imported about 70–80 % of its food .
and 80–84 % of the food it rations to the public .
raúl castro ridiculed the bureaucracy that shackled the agriculture sector .
in total , industrial production accounted for almost *num* % of cuban gdp , or us$6 .
*num* billion and employed *num* % of the population , or *num* , *num* , *num* people , in *num* .
a rally in sugar prices in *num* stimulated investment and development of sugar processing .
in *num* cuba's biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry was gaining in importance .
among the products sold internationally are vaccines against various viral and bacterial pathogens .
for example , the drug heberprot-p was developed as a cure for diabetic foot ulcer and had success in many developing countries .
cuba has also done pioneering work on the development of drugs for cancer treatment .
scientists such as v .
verez-bencomo were awarded international prizes for their contributions in biotechnology and sugar cane .
in the mid-1990s tourism surpassed sugar , long the mainstay of the cuban economy , as the primary source of foreign exchange .
havana devotes significant resources to building tourist facilities and renovating historic structures .
cuban officials estimate roughly *num* .
*num* million tourists visited cuba in *num* yielding about $1 .
*num* billion in gross revenues .
in *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* foreign visitors arrived in cuba .
revenue from tourism reached us $1 .
*num* billion .
by *num* , some *num* million visitors brought nearly £2 billion yearly .
the growth of tourism has had social and economic repercussions .
this led to speculation of the emergence of a two-tier economy and the fostering of a state of tourist apartheid .
this situation was exacerbated by the influx of dollars during the 1990s , potentially creating a dual economy based on the dollar ( the currency of tourists ) on the one hand and the peso on the other .
scarce imported goods – and even some of local manufacture , such as rum and coffee – could be had at dollar-only stores , but were hard to find or unavailable at peso prices .
as a result , cubans who earned only in the peso economy , outside the tourist sector , were at a disadvantage .
those with dollar incomes based upon the service industry began to live more comfortably .
this widened the gulf between cubans ' material standards of living , in conflict with the cuban government's long term socialist policies .
cuba has a small retail sector .
a few large shopping centers operated in havana as of september *num* but charged us prices .
pre-revolutionary commercial districts were largely shut down .
the majority of stores are small dollar stores , bodegas , agro-mercados ( farmers ' markets ) and street stands .
the financial sector remains heavily regulated and access to credit for entrepreneurial activity is seriously impeded by the shallowness of the financial market .
the netherlands receives the largest share of cuban exports ( *num* % ) , *num* to *num* % of which go through indiana finance bv , a company owned by the van ' t wout family , who have close personal ties with fidel castro .
currently , this trend can be seen in other colonial caribbean communities who have direct political ties with the global economy .
cuba's primary import partner is venezuela .
the second largest trade partner is canada , with a *num* % share of the cuban export market .
cuba began courting foreign investment in the special period .
foreign investors must form joint ventures with the cuban government .
the sole exception to this rule are venezuelans , who are allowed to hold *num* % ownership in businesses due to an agreement between cuba and venezuela .
cuban officials said in early *num* that *num* joint ventures had begun .
many of these are loans or contracts for management , supplies , or services normally not considered equity investment in western economies .
investors are constrained by the u .
s .
-cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act that provides sanctions for those who traffic in property expropriated from u .
s .
citizens .
cuba's average tariff rate is *num* percent .
the country's planned economy deters foreign trade and investment .
the state maintains strict capital and exchange controls .
cuba has two official currencies , both of which are called peso .
one is sometimes called the " national currency " ( or cup ) the other is the convertible peso ( or cuc , often called " dollar " in the spoken language ) .
there are currently *num* cup per cuc .
in *num* the possession and use of us dollars was legalised , and by *num* the us dollar was in widespread use in the country .
to capture the hard currency flowing into the island through tourism and remittances – estimated at $500–800 million annually – the government set up state-run " dollar stores " throughout cuba that sold " luxury " food , household and clothing items , compared with basic necessities , which could be bought using national pesos .
as such , the standard of living diverged between those who had access to dollars and those without .
jobs that could earn dollar salaries or tips from foreign businesses and tourists became highly desirable .
it was common to meet doctors , engineers , scientists and other professionals working in restaurants or as taxicab drivers .
however , in response to stricter economic sanctions by the us and because the authorities were pleased with cuba's economic recovery , the cuban government decided in october *num* to remove us dollars from circulation .
in its place , the convertible peso was created , which although not internationally traded , has a value pegged to the us dollar *num* : *num* .
a *num* % surcharge is levied for cash conversions from us dollars to the convertible peso , which does not apply to other currencies , so it acts as an encouragement for tourists to bring currencies such as euros , pounds sterling or canadian dollars into cuba .
an increasing number of tourist zones accept euros .
owners of small private restaurants ( " paladares " ) originally could seat no more than *num* people and can only employ family members .
set monthly fees must be paid regardless of income earned and frequent inspections yield stiff fines when any of the many self-employment regulations are violated .
as of *num* , more than *num* , *num* farmers had signed up to lease land from the government for bonus crops .
before , home-owners were only allowed to swap ; once buying and selling were allowed , prices rose .
in cities , " urban agriculture " farms small parcels .
growing organopónicos ( organic gardens ) in the private sector has been attractive to city-dwelling small producers who sell their products where they produce them , avoiding taxes and enjoying a measure of government help from the ministry of agriculture ( minagri ) in the form of seed houses and advisers .
typical wages range from *num* non-convertible cuban pesos a month , for a factory worker , to *num* per month for a doctor , or a range of around 17–30 us dollars per month .
however , the human development index of cuba still ranks much higher than the vast majority of latin american nations .
after cuba lost soviet subsidies in *num* , malnutrition resulted in an outbreak of diseases .
despite this , the poverty level reported by the government is one of the lowest in the developing world , ranking *ord* out of *num* countries , *ord* in latin america and *ord* among all countries .
pensions are among the smallest in the americas at $9 .
*num* / month .
in *num* , raúl castro increased minimum pensions by *num* dollars , which he said was to recompense for those who have " dedicated a great part of their lives to working .
.
.
and who remain firm in defense of socialism " .
the relationship cultivated between cuba and venezuela in recent years resulted in agreements in which venezuela provides cheap oil in exchange for cuban " missions " of doctors to bolster the venezuelan health care system .
cuba has the second-highest per capita number of physicians in the world ( behind italy ) .
the country sends tens of thousands of doctors to other countries as aid , as well as to obtain favorable trade terms .
in nominal terms , the venezuelan subsidy is higher than whatever subsidy the soviet union gave to cuba , with the cuban state receiving cheap oil and the cuban economy receiving around $6 billion annually .
according to mesa-lago , a cuban-born us economist .
" if this help stops , industry is paralysed , transportation is paralysed and you'll see the effects in everything from electricity to sugar mills , " he said .
from an economic standpoint , cuba relies much more on venezuela than venezuela does on cuba .
as of *num* , venezuela accounted for *num* .
*num* % of cuba's gdp while cuba only accounted for roughly *num* % of venezuela's .
because of this reliance , the most recent economic crisis in venezuela ( 2012-present ) , with inflation nearing *num* % and gdp shrinking by *num* % in *num* , cuba is not receiving their amount of payment and heavily subsidized oil .
further budget cuts are in the plans for *num* marking a third straight year .
in *num* cuba's economic freedom score was *num* .
*num* , making its economy one of the world's least free .
its overall score was *num* .
*num* point higher than last year , with deteriorations in trade freedom , fiscal freedom , monetary freedom and freedom from corruption counterbalanced by an improvement in business freedom .
cuba ranked least free of *num* countries in the south and central america / caribbean region and its overall score was significantly lower than the regional average .
over the 20-year history of the index , cuba's economic freedom remained stagnant near the bottom of the “repressed” category .
its overall score improvement was less than *num* point over the past two decades , with score gains in fiscal freedom and freedom from corruption offset by double-digit declines in business freedom and investment freedom .
despite some progress in restructuring the state sector since *num* , the private sector remained constrained by heavy regulations and tight state controls .
the heritage foundation states that open-market policies were not in place to spur growth in trade and investment and the lack of competition continued to stifle dynamic economic expansion .
a watered-down reform package endorsed by the party trimmed the number of state workers and expanded the list of approved professions , but many details of the reform remained obscure .
as of *num* , cuba had $47 .
*num* billion in revenues and $50 .
*num* billion in expenditures with *num* .
*num* % of gdp in public debt , an account balance of $513 million and $4 .
*num* billion in reserves of foreign exchange and gold .
government spending is around *num* percent of gdp and public debt is around *num* percent of the domestic economy .
despite reforms , the government continues to play a large role in the economy .
the top individual income tax rate is *num* percent .
the top corporate tax rate is *num* percent ( *num* percent for wholly foreign-owned companies ) .
other taxes include a tax on property transfers and a sales tax .
the overall tax burden is *num* .
*num* percent of gdp .

elbląg elbląg ( ; ; old prussian : " elbings " ) is a city in northern poland on the eastern edge of the żuławy region with *num* , *num* inhabitants ( *num* december *num* ) .
it is the capital of elbląg county and has been assigned ( since *num* ) to the warmian-masurian voivodeship .
previously it was the capital of elbląg voivodeship ( 1975–1998 ) and a county seat within gdańsk voivodeship ( 1945–1975 ) .
elbląg is one of the oldest cities in the province .
its history dates back to *num* , when the teutonic order constructed their fortified stronghold on the banks of a nearby river .
the castle subsequently served as the official seat of the teutonic order masters .
elbląg became part of the hanseatic league , which contributed much to the city's wealth .
through the hansa agreement , the city was linked to other major ports like danzig ( gdańsk ) , lübeck and amsterdam .
after the defeat of the teutonic knights at the battle of grunwald and conclusion of the second peace of thorn in *num* , the city was annexed by poland .
it then flourished and turned into a significant trading point , but its growth was eventually hindered by the second northern war and the swedish deluge .
the city was transferred to prussia after the first partition of poland in *num* .
its trading role greatly weakened , until the era of industrialization , which occurred in the *ord* century .
it was then that the famous elbląg canal was commissioned .
after world war ii the city again became part of poland .
the war casualties were catastrophic , especially the severe destruction of the old town district , one of the grandest and most beautiful in east prussia .
today , elbląg has over *num* , *num* inhabitants and is a " vibrant city with an attractive tourist base " .
it serves as an academic and financial center and among its numerous historic monuments is the market gate from *num* and st .
nicholas cathedral .
elbląg is also known for its archaeological sites , museums and the largest brewery in the country .
the elbląg canal , built in 1825–44 under prussia , is a tourist site of elbląg .
the canal is believed to be one of the most important monuments related to the history of engineering and has been named one of the seven wonders of poland .
the canal was also named one of poland's official national historic monuments ( " pomnik historii " ) in *num* .
its listing is maintained by the national heritage board of poland .
"elbląg " derives from the earlier german-language " elbing " , which is the name by which the teutonic knights knew both the river here and the citadel they established on its banks in *num* .
the purpose of the citadel was to prevent the old prussian settlement of truso from being reoccupied , the german crusaders being at war with the pagan prussians .
the citadel was named after the river , itself of uncertain etymology .
one traditional etymology connects it to the name of the helveconae , a germanic tribe mentioned in ancient greek and latin sources , but the etymology or language of the tribal name remains unknown .
the oldest known mention of the river or town elbing is in the form " ylfing " in the report of a sailor wulfstan from the end of the *ord* century , in " " which was written in anglo-saxon in king alfred's reign .
elbing was almost completely destroyed at the end of world war ii .
the city became the polish elbląg after the war , when the area was ceded to poland under border changes promulgated at the potsdam conference .
parts of the inner city were gradually rebuilt , and around *num* rebuilding was begun in a style emulating the previous architecture , in many cases over the same foundations and utilizing old bricks and portions of the same walls .
the western suburbs of the old city have not been reconstructed .
the modern city adjoins about half the length of the river between lake drużno and elbląg bay ( " zatoka elbląska " , an arm of the vistula lagoon ) , and spreads out on both banks , though mainly on the eastern side .
to the east is the elbląg upland ( " wysoczyzna elbląska " ) , a dome pushed up by glacial compression , *num* km in diameter and high at its greatest elevation .
it gives the appearance of ridges and parkland .
views to the west show flat fields extending to the horizon ; this part of the vistula delta ( " żuławy wiślane " ) is used mainly for agricultural purposes .
to the south are the marshes and swamps of drużno .
the elbląg river has been left in a more natural state through the city , but elsewhere it is a controlled channel with branches .
one of them , the jagiellonski channel ( " kanał jagielloński " ) , leads to the nogat river , along which navigation to gdańsk is common .
the elbląg canal ( " kanał elbląski " ) connecting lake drużno with drwęca river and lake jeziorak is a popular tourist site .
elbląg is not a deep-water port .
the draft of vessels using its waterways must be no greater than by law .
the turning area at elbląg is diameter and a pilot is required for large vessels .
deep water vessels cannot manoeuvre ; in that sense , elbląg has become a subsidiary port of gdańsk .
traffic of smaller vessels at elbląg is within the river and very marginal , while larger vessels cannot reach the open baltic sea because the channel , once built in east-prussia to go through the peninsula , has belonged to russia since *num* .
the city features three quay complexes , movable cranes , and railways .
elbląg is located about south-east of gdańsk and south-west of kaliningrad , russia .
the city is a port on the river elbląg , which flows into the vistula lagoon about to the north , thus giving the city access to the baltic sea via the russian-controlled strait of baltiysk .
the old town ( ) is located on the river elbląg connecting lake drużno to the vistula lagoon , about from the lagoon and from gdańsk .
the settlement was first mentioned as " ilfing " in " " , an anglo-saxon chronicle written in king alfred's reign using information from a viking who had visited the area .
during the middle ages , the viking settlement of truso was located on lake drużno , near the current site of elbląg in historical pogesania ; the settlement burned down in the *ord* century .
early in the *ord* century the teutonic knights conquered the region , built a castle , and founded elbing on the lake , with a population mostly from lübeck ( today the lake , now much smaller , no longer reaches the city ) .
after the defeat of the teutonic knights and the destruction of the castle by the inhabitants , the city successively came under the sovereignty of the polish crown ( *num* ) , the kingdom of prussia ( *num* ) , and germany ( *num* ) .
elbing was heavily damaged in world war ii , and its german citizens were expelled upon the war's end .
the city became part of poland in *num* and was repopulated with polish citizens .
the seaport of truso was first mentioned ca .
*num* by wulfstan of hedeby , an anglo-saxon sailor , travelling on the south coast of the baltic sea at the behest of king alfred the great of england .
the exact location of truso was not known for a long time , as the seashore has significantly changed , but most historians trace the settlement inside or near to modern elbląg on lake drużno .
truso was located at territory already known to the roman empire and earlier .
it was an important seaport serving the vistula river bay on the early medieval baltic sea trade routes which led from birka in the north to the island of gotland and to visby in the baltic sea .
from there , traders continued further south to carnuntum along the amber road .
the ancient amber road led further southwest and southeast to the black sea and eventually to asia .
the east-west trade route went from truso , along the baltic sea to jutland , and from there inland by river to hedeby , a large trading center in jutland .
the main goods of truso were amber , furs , and slaves .
archaeological finds in *num* and diggings in the 1920s placed truso at gut hansdorf .
a large burial field was also found at elbing .
recent polish diggings have found burned beams and ashes and thousand-year-old artifacts in an area of about *num* hectares .
many of these artifacts are now displayed at the muzeum w elblągu .
attempts to conquer prussian land began in *num* , when bolesław i the brave , at the urging of the pope , sent a contingent of soldiers and a missionary ( adalbert of prague ) to the pagan prussians , a non-slavic people , on a crusade of conquest and conversion .
the crusade encompassed much of the baltic sea coast , including danzig ( present day gdańsk ) , and other areas of the coast up to sambia .
starting in *num* additional crusades were called for by konrad of masovia , who mainly sought to conquer prussian territory , rather than actually convert the indigenous prussians .
despite heroic efforts , old prussian sovereignty would eventually collapse after a succession of wars instigated by pope honorius iii and his frequent calls for crusade .
before the prussians and their neighbors to the west , the pomeranians , were finally brought to heel , polish rulers and the duchy of masovia , both by then christianised peoples , would be continually frustrated in their attempts at northern expansion .
aside from minor border raids , major campaigns against the prussians would be launched in *num* , *num* , and *num* .
after a particularly sound defeat by prussian forces in *num* , polish forces in chełmno , the seat of christian of oliva and the duchy of masovia , were forced onto the defensive .
in *num* duke konrad i of masovia summoned the teutonic knights for assistance ; by *num* they had secured chełmno ( culm ) and begun claiming conquered territories for themselves under the authority of the holy roman empire , although these claims were rejected by the poles , whose ambition had been to conquer prussia all along .
the teutonic order's strategy was to move down the vistula and secure the delta , establishing a barrier between the prussians and danzig .
the victorious teutonic knights built a castle at elbing .
the chronicon terrae prussiae describes the conflict in the vicinity of lake drusen ( now drużno ) shortly before the founding of elbing : truso did not disappear suddenly to be replaced with the citadel and town of elbing during the prussian crusade .
it had already burned down in the tenth century , with the population dispersed in the area .
the chronicon terrae prussiae describes the founding of elbing under the leadership of hermann balk .
after building two ships , the pilgerim ( pilgrim ) and the vridelant ( friedland ) , with the assistance of margrave henry iii of margraviate of meissen , the teutonic knights used them to clear the vistula lagoon ( " frisches haff " ) and the vistula spit of prussians : apparently the river was in pomesania , which the knights had just finished clearing , but the bay was in pogesania .
the first elbing was placed in pogesania : both landings were amphibious operations conducted from the ships .
the " chronicon " relates that they were in use for many years and then were sunk in lake drusen .
in *num* the dominican order was invited to build a monastery on a grant of land .
pomesania was not secured , however , and from 1240-1242 the order began building a brick castle on the south side of the settlement .
it may be significant that elbing's first industry was the same as truso's had been : manufacture of amber and bone artifacts for export .
in *num* william of modena created the diocese of pomesania and three others .
they were at first only ideological constructs , but the tides of time turned them into reality in that same century .
the foundation of elbing was perhaps not the end of the old prussian story in the region .
in *num* a manuscript listing a vocabulary of the baltic old prussian language , named the elbing-prussian dictionary ( ) , or more commonly in english just elbing vocabulary , was found among some manuscripts from a merchant's house .
it contained *num* words in a dialect now termed pomesanian with their equivalents in an early form of german .
the origin of the vocabulary remains unknown .
its format is like that of modern travel dictionaries ; i .
e .
, it may have been used by german speakers to communicate with old prussians , but the specific circumstances are only speculative .
the manuscript became the codex neumannianus .
it disappeared after a british bombing raid destroyed the library at elbing but before then facsimiles had been made .
the date of the mss was estimated at ca .
*num* , but it was a copy .
there is no evidence concerning the provenance of the original , except that it must have been in pomesanian .
in *num* the town was granted a constitution under lübeck law , used in maritime circumstances , instead of magdeburg rights common in other cities in central europe .
this decision of the order was in keeping with its general strategy of espousing the trade association that in *num* would become the hanseatic league .
the order seized on this association early and used it to establish bases throughout the baltic .
the order's involvement in the league was somewhat contradictory .
in whatever cities they founded the ultimate authority was the commander of the town , who kept office in the citadel , typically used as a prison .
lübeck law , on the other hand , provided for self-government of the town .
membership in the hanseatic league meant having important trading contacts with england , flanders , france , and the netherlands .
the city received numerous merchant privileges from the rulers of england , poland , pomerania , and the teutonic order .
for instance , the privilege of the old town ( , ) was upgraded in *num* , while in *num* it was granted an emporium privilege for grains , metals , and forest products .
except for the citadel and churches , elbing at the time was more of a small village by modern standards .
its area was .
it featured a wharf , a marketplace and five streets , as well as a number of churches .
the castle was completed in *num* .
in *num* fire destroyed the entire settlement except for the churches , which were of brick .
a new circuit wall was started immediately .
from *num* to *num* elbląg was rebuilt .
a separate settlement called new town ( ) was founded ca .
*num* and received lübeck rights in *num* .
in *num* the black death struck the town , toward the end of the european plague .
after the population recovered it continued building up the city and in *num* a crane was built for the port .
the german-language " elbinger rechtsbuch " , written in elbing , prussia documented among other laws for the first time polish common law .
the german-language polish laws are based on the sachsenspiegel and were written down to aid the judges .
it is thus the oldest source for documented polish common law and is in polish referred to as the " księga elbląska " ( book of elbląg ) .
it was written down in the second half of the *ord* century .
in *num* several western and eastern prussian towns formed the prussian confederation , which led the revolt of prussia against the rule of the teutonic knights in *num* .
for assistance against the order , the confederation asked for help from king casimir iv of poland ; casimir's subsequent claiming of prussia led to the thirteen years ' war .
after the section of prussians and polish victory over the teutonic order , the city became part of the autonomous province of royal prussia under the suzerainty of the polish crown in the second peace of thorn .
the city was known to the polish crown by its polish name elbląg .
with the creation of the polish–lithuanian commonwealth in *num* , the city was brought under direct control of the polish crown .
with the *ord* century protestant reformation the burghers became lutherans and the first lutheran gymnasium was established in elbląg in *num* .
from *num* elbing / elbląg had close trade relations with england , to which the city accorded free trade .
english , scottish , and irish merchants settled in the city .
they formed the scottish reformed church of elbląg and became elbing citizens , aiding lutheran sweden in the thirty years ' war .
the rivalry of nearby danzig interrupted trading links several times .
by *num* elbląg had left the hanseatic league owing to its close business dealings with england .
famous inhabitants of the city at that time included native sons hans von bodeck and samuel hartlib .
during the thirty years ' war , swedish chancellor axel oxenstierna brought the moravian brethren refugee john amos comenius to elbląg for six years ( 1642–1648 ) .
in *num* johann stobäus , who composed with johann eccard , published the " preussische fest-lieder " , a number of evangelical prussian songs .
in *num* the city recorder daniel barholz noted that the city council employed " bernsteindreher " , or " paternostermacher " , licensed and guilded amber craftsmen who worked on prayer beads , rosaries , and many other items made of amber .
members of the barholz family became mayors and councillors .
during the thirty years ' war , the vistula lagoon was the main southern baltic base of king gustavus adolphus of sweden , who was hailed as the protector of the protestants .
by *num* the vistula lagoon had gone to elector frederick william of brandenburg-prussia , but was returned in *num* .
the poet christian wernicke was born in *num* in elbing , while gottfried achenwall became famous for his teachings in natural law and human rights law .
in 1700–1710 it was occupied by swedish troops .
in *num* it was besieged , taken by storm on february *num* , *num* by russian troops with support of prussian artillery .
the city was handed over to polish king augustus ii in *num* .
the imperial cartographer johann friedrich endersch completed a map of warmia ( ) in *num* and also made a copper etching of the galley named " the city of elbing " ( ) .
during the war of the polish succession in *num* , elbing / elbląg and danzig were placed under military occupation by russia and saxony .
the town came again under occupation by russia from 1758-1762 during the seven years ' war .
during the first partition of poland in *num* , resulting in the re-unification of prussia , the city state was annexed by king frederick the great of the kingdom of prussia .
elbing became part of the new prussian province of west prussia in *num* .
in the *num* provincial reorganization following the napoleonic wars , elbing and its hinterland were included within regierungsbezirk danzig in west prussia .
elbing industrialized under the sovereignty of the hohenzollern kings in berlin .
in *num* the first steamship was built by ignatz grunau .
in *num* ferdinand schichau started the schichau-werke company in elbing as well as another shipyard in danzig later on .
schichau constructed the " borussia " , the first screw-vessel in germany .
schichau-werke built hydraulic machinery , ships , steam engines , and torpedoes .
after the inauguration of the railway to königsberg in *num* , elbing's industry began to grow .
schichau worked together with his son-in-law carl h .
zise , who continued the industrial complex after schichau's death .
schichau erected large complexes for his many thousands of workers .
georg steenke , an engineer from königsberg , connected elbing near the baltic sea with the southern part of prussia by building the oberländischer kanal ( elbląg canal ) .
elbing became part of the prussian-led german empire in *num* during the unification of germany .
as elbing became an industrial city , the social democratic party of germany ( spd ) frequently received the majority of votes ; in the *num* reichstag elections the spd received *num* % of the vote .
after world war i , most of west prussia became part of the second polish republic .
elbing was joined to german east prussia , and was separated from weimar germany by the polish corridor .
during the nazi germany era ( 1933–1945 ) , three subcamps of the stutthof concentration camp were located near the town : " elbing " , " elbing ( org .
todt ) " , and " elbing ( schinau ) " .
these were closed and many of the german inhabitants of elbing forced to flee as the soviet red army approached the city toward the end of world war ii ( see evacuation of east prussia ) .
laid under siege since january *num* , *num* , about *num* % of the city infrastructure was destroyed , including most of the historical city center .
the town was captured by the soviet red army during the night of february *num* / *num* , *num* .
during the first days of the siege most of the population of approximately *num* , *num* persons fled .
after the end of war , in spring *num* , the region together with the town of elbing became part of poland as a result of the potsdam conference .
almost all germans who remained or returned were expelled by the communist regime during the following months .
the city was settled with poles from the eastern borderlands , which were annexed by the soviet union .
after the expulsion of most of the german population , the city was repopulated and given the polish name " elbląg " .
an intense expunging of german cultural and linguistic identity was carried out by the communist authorities throughout the former german city .
new communist era history books referred to elblag as part of " the recovered territories " to justify the expulsions of the previous inhabitants .
of the new inhabitants , *num* % were poles expelled from polish areas annexed by the soviet union from central poland .
parts of the damaged historical city center were completely demolished , with the bricks being used to rebuild warsaw and gdańsk .
the communist authorities had originally planned that the old town , utterly destroyed during the fighting since january *num* , *num* , would be built over with blocks of flats ; however , economic difficulties thwarted this effort .
two churches were reconstructed and the remaining ruins of the old town were torn down in the 1960s .
along with tricity and szczecin , elbląg was the scene of rioting in the coastal cities in *num* ( see also polish *num* protests ) .
since *num* the german minority population has had a modest resurgence , with the elbinger deutsche minderheit organization counting around *num* members in *num* .
restoration of the old town began after *num* .
since the beginning of the restoration , an extensive archaeological programme has been carried out .
most of the city's heritage was destroyed during the construction of basements in the *ord* century or during world war ii , but the backyards and latrines of the houses remained largely unchanged , and have provided information on the city's history .
in some instances , private investors have incorporated parts of preserved stonework into new architecture .
by *num* , approximately *num* % of the old town had been reconstructed .
the city museum presents many pieces of art and items of everyday use , including the only *ord* century binoculars preserved in europe .
elbląg is also home to the elbrewery , poland's largest brewery , which belongs to the żywiec group ( heineken ) .
the history of the elblag brewing tradition dates back to *num* , when teutonic master siegfried von leuchtwangen granted brewing privileges to the town of elbing .
the present brewery was founded in *num* as the elbinger aktien-brauerei .
in the early 1900s , the brewery was the exclusive supplier of pilsner beer to the court of german emperor wilhelm ii .
until world war ii there were many gothic , renaissance and baroque houses in elbląg's old town ; some of them are reconstructed .
brainfuck brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in *num* by urban müller , and is notable for its extreme minimalism .
the language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer .
while it is fully turing complete , it is not intended for practical use , but to challenge and amuse programmers .
brainfuck simply requires one to break commands into microscopic steps .
the language's name is a reference to the slang term " brainfuck " , which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one's understanding .
in *num* , urban müller , a swiss physics student , took over a small online archive for amiga software .
the archive grew more popular , and was soon mirrored around the world .
today , it is the world's largest amiga archive , known as aminet .
müller designed brainfuck with the goal of implementing it with the smallest possible compiler , inspired by the 1024-byte compiler for the false programming language .
müller's original compiler was implemented in machine language and compiled to a binary with a size of *num* bytes .
he uploaded the first brainfuck compiler to aminet in *num* .
the program came with a " readme " file , which briefly described the language , and challenged the reader " who can program anything useful with it ? : ) " .
müller also included an interpreter and some quite elaborate examples .
a second version of the compiler used only *num* bytes .
as aminet grew , the compiler became popular among the amiga community , and in time it was implemented for other platforms .
several brainfuck compilers have been made smaller than *num* bytes , and one is only *num* bytes .
except for its two i / o commands , brainfuck is a minor variation of the formal programming language p′′ created by corrado böhm in *num* , which in turn is explicitly based on the turing machine .
in fact , using six symbols equivalent to the respective brainfuck commands codice_1 , codice_2 , codice_3 , codice_4 , codice_5 , codice_6 , böhm provided an explicit program for each of the basic functions that together serve to compute any computable function .
so the first " brainfuck " programs appear in böhm's *num* paper – and they were programs sufficient to prove turing completeness .
a version with explicit memory addressing rather without stack and a conditional jump was introduced by joachim lambek in *num* under the name of the infinite abacus , consisting of an infinite number of cells and two instructions : he proves the infinite abacus can compute any computable recursive function by programming kleene set of basic μ-recursive function .
his machine was simulated by melzac's machine modeling computation via arithmetic rather than logic mimicking a human operator moving pebbles on an abacus , hence the requirement that all numbers must be positive .
melzac , whose one instruction set computer is equivalent to an infinite abacus , gives programs for multiplication , gcd , n prime number , representation in base b , sorting by magnitude , and shows how to simulate an arbitrary turing machine .
the language consists of eight commands , listed below .
a brainfuck program is a sequence of these commands , possibly interspersed with other characters ( which are ignored ) .
the commands are executed sequentially , with some exceptions : an instruction pointer begins at the first command , and each command it points to is executed , after which it normally moves forward to the next command .
the program terminates when the instruction pointer moves past the last command .
the brainfuck language uses a simple machine model consisting of the program and instruction pointer , as well as an array of at least *num* , *num* byte cells initialized to zero ; a movable data pointer ( initialized to point to the leftmost byte of the array ) ; and two streams of bytes for input and output ( most often connected to a keyboard and a monitor respectively , and using the ascii character encoding ) .
the eight language commands each consist of a single character : codice_5 and codice_6 match as parentheses usually do : each codice_5 matches exactly one codice_6 and vice versa , the codice_5 comes first , and there can be no unmatched codice_5 or codice_6 between the two .
brainfuck programs can be translated into c using the following substitutions , assuming codice_16 is of type codice_17 and has been initialized to point to an array of zeroed bytes : as the name suggests , brainfuck programs tend to be difficult to comprehend .
this is partly because any mildly complex task requires a long sequence of commands , and partly it is because the program's text gives no direct indications of the program's state .
these , as well as brainfuck's inefficiency and its limited input / output capabilities , are some of the reasons it is not used for serious programming .
nonetheless , like any turing complete language , brainfuck is theoretically capable of computing any computable function or simulating any other computational model , if given access to an unlimited amount of memory .
a variety of brainfuck programs have been written .
although brainfuck programs , especially complicated ones , are difficult to write , it is quite trivial to write an interpreter for brainfuck in a more typical language such as c due to its simplicity .
there even exist brainfuck interpreters written in the brainfuck language itself .
brainfuck is an example of a so-called turing tarpit : it can be used to write " any " program , but it is not practical to do so , because brainfuck provides so little abstraction that the programs get very long or complicated .
as a first , simple example , the following code snippet will add the current cell's value to the next cell : each time the loop is executed , the current cell is decremented , the data pointer moves to the right , that next cell is incremented , and the data pointer moves left again .
this sequence is repeated until the starting cell is *num* .
this can be incorporated into a simple addition program as follows : the following program prints " hello world ! " and a newline to the screen : for " readability " , this code has been spread across many lines and blanks and comments have been added .
brainfuck ignores all characters except the eight commands codice_18 so no special syntax for comments is needed ( as long as the comments do not contain the command characters ) .
the code could just as well have been written as : this program enciphers its input with the rot13 cipher .
to do this , it must map characters a-m ( ascii 65-77 ) to n-z ( 78-90 ) , and vice versa .
also it must map a-m ( 97-109 ) to n-z ( 110-122 ) and vice versa .
it must map all other characters to themselves ; it reads characters one at a time and outputs their enciphered equivalents until it reads an eof ( here assumed to be represented as either -1 or " no change " ) , at which point the program terminates .
the basic approach used is as follows .
calling the input character " x " , divide " x"-1 by *num* , keeping quotient and remainder .
unless the quotient is *num* or *num* , just output " x " , having kept a copy of it during the division .
if the quotient is *num* or *num* , divide the remainder ( ( " x"-1 ) modulo *num* ) by *num* ; if the quotient here is *num* , output " x"+13 ; if *num* , output " x"-13 ; if *num* , output " x " .
regarding the division algorithm , when dividing " y " by " z " to get a quotient " q " and remainder " r " , there is an outer loop which sets " q " and " r " first to the quotient and remainder of *num* / "z " , then to those of *num* / "z " , and so on ; after it has executed " y " times , this outer loop terminates , leaving " q " and " r " set to the quotient and remainder of " y" / "z " .
( the dividend " y " is used as a diminishing counter that controls how many times this loop is executed .
) within the loop , there is code to increment " r " and decrement " y " , which is usually sufficient ; however , every " z"th time through the outer loop , it is necessary to zero " r " and increment " q " .
this is done with a diminishing counter set to the divisor " z " ; each time through the outer loop , this counter is decremented , and when it reaches zero , it is refilled by moving the value from " r " back into it .
partly because urban müller did not write a thorough language specification , the many subsequent brainfuck interpreters and compilers have come to use slightly different dialects of brainfuck .
in the classic distribution , the cells are of 8-bit size ( cells are bytes ) , and this is still the most common size .
however , to read non-textual data , a brainfuck program may need to distinguish an end-of-file condition from any possible byte value ; thus 16-bit cells have also been used .
some implementations have used 32-bit cells , 64-bit cells , or bignum cells with practically unlimited range , but programs that use this extra range are likely to be slow , since storing the value " n " into a cell requires ω ( " n " ) time as a cell's value may only be changed by incrementing and decrementing .
in all these variants , the codice_19 and codice_20 commands still read and write data in bytes .
in most of them , the cells wrap around , i .
e .
incrementing a cell which holds its maximal value ( with the codice_1 command ) will bring it to its minimal value and vice versa .
the exceptions are implementations which are distant from the underlying hardware , implementations that use bignums , and implementations that try to enforce portability .
it is usually easy to write brainfuck programs that do not ever cause integer wraparound or overflow , and therefore don't depend on cell size .
generally this means avoiding increment of +255 ( unsigned 8-bit wraparound ) , or avoiding overstepping the boundaries of [ -128 , +127 ] ( signed 8-bit wraparound ) ( since there are no comparison operators , a program cannot distinguish between a signed and unsigned two's complement fixed-bit-size cell and negativeness of numbers is a matter of interpretation ) .
for more details on integer wraparound , see the integer overflow article .
in the classic distribution , the array has *num* , *num* cells , and the pointer begins at the leftmost cell .
even more cells are needed to store things like the millionth fibonacci number , and the easiest way to make the language turing complete is to make the array unlimited on the right .
a few implementations extend the array to the left as well ; this is an uncommon feature , and therefore portable brainfuck programs do not depend on it .
when the pointer moves outside the bounds of the array , some implementations will give an error message , some will try to extend the array dynamically , some will not notice and will produce undefined behavior , and a few will move the pointer to the opposite end of the array .
some tradeoffs are involved : expanding the array dynamically to the right is the most user-friendly approach and is good for memory-hungry programs , but it carries a speed penalty .
if a fixed-size array is used it is helpful to make it very large , or better yet let the user set the size .
giving an error message for bounds violations is very useful for debugging but even that carries a speed penalty unless it can be handled by the operating system's memory protections .
different operating systems ( and sometimes different programming environments ) use subtly different versions of ascii .
the most important difference is in the code used for the end of a line of text .
ms-dos and microsoft windows use a crlf , i .
e .
a *num* followed by a *num* , in most contexts .
unix and its descendants ( including gnu / linux and mac os x ) and amigas use just *num* , and older macs use just *num* .
it would be difficult if brainfuck programs had to be rewritten for different operating systems .
however , a unified standard was easy to create .
urban müller's compiler and his example programs use *num* , on both input and output ; so do a large majority of existing brainfuck programs ; and *num* is also more convenient to use than crlf .
thus , brainfuck implementations should make sure that brainfuck programs that assume newline=10 will run properly ; many do so , but some do not .
this assumption is also consistent with most of the world's sample code for c and other languages , in that they use ' \n ' , or *num* , for their newlines .
on systems that use crlf line endings , the c standard library transparently remaps " \n " to " \r\n " on output and " \r\n " to " \n " on input for streams not opened in binary mode .
the behavior of the " codice_19 " command when an end-of-file condition has been encountered varies .
some implementations set the cell at the pointer to *num* , some set it to the c constant eof ( in practice this is usually -1 ) , some leave the cell's value unchanged .
there is no real consensus ; arguments for the three behaviors are as follows .
setting the cell to *num* avoids the use of negative numbers , and makes it marginally more concise to write a loop that reads characters until eof occurs .
this is a language extension devised by panu kalliokoski .
setting the cell to -1 allows eof to be distinguished from any byte value ( if the cells are larger than bytes ) , which is necessary for reading non-textual data ; also , it is the behavior of the c translation of " codice_19 " given in müller's readme file .
however , it is not obvious that those c translations are to be taken as normative .
leaving the cell's value unchanged is the behavior of urban müller's brainfuck compiler .
this behavior can easily coexist with either of the others ; for instance , a program that assumes eof=0 can set the cell to *num* before each " codice_19 " command , and will then work correctly on implementations that do either eof=0 or eof="no change " .
it is so easy to accommodate the " no change " behavior that any brainfuck programmer interested in portability should do so .
many people have created brainfuck equivalents ( languages with commands that directly map to brainfuck ) or brainfuck derivatives ( languages that extend its behavior or map it into new semantic territory ) .
chalmers university of technology chalmers university of technology ( , often shortened to chalmers ) is a swedish university located in gothenburg that focuses on research and education in technology , natural science , architecture , maritime and other management areas .
the university was founded in *num* following a donation by william chalmers , a director of the swedish east india company .
he donated part of his fortune for the establishment of an " industrial school " .
chalmers was run as a private institution until *num* , when the institute became a state-owned university .
in *num* , the school was incorporated as an aktiebolag under the control of the swedish government , the faculty and the student union .
chalmers is one of only three universities in sweden which are named after a person , the other two being karolinska institutet and linnaeus university .
beginning *num* may *num* , chalmers has *num* departments .
furthermore , chalmers is home to eight areas of advance and six national competence centers in key fields such as materials , mathematical modelling , environmental science , and vehicle safety .
chalmers university of technology's research infrastructure includes everything from advanced real or virtual labs to large databases , computer capacity for large-scale calculations and research facilities .
approximately *num* % of sweden's graduate engineers and architects are educated at chalmers .
each year , around *num* post graduate degrees are awarded as well as *num* graduate degrees .
about *num* , *num* post-graduate students attend programmes at the university , and many students are taking master of science engineering programmes and the master of architecture programme .
since *num* , all master's programmes are taught in english for both national and international students .
this was a result of the adaptation to the bologna process that started in *num* at chalmers ( as the first technical university in sweden ) .
currently , about *num* % of all students at chalmers come from countries outside sweden to enroll in a master's or phd program .
around *num* , *num* students also attend bachelor of science engineering programmes , merchant marine and other undergraduate courses at campus lindholmen .
chalmers also shares some students with gothenburg university in the joint it university project .
the it university focuses exclusively on information technology and offers bachelor's and master's programmes with degrees issued from either chalmers or gothenburg university , depending on the programme .
chalmers confers honorary doctoral degrees to people outside the university who have shown great merit in their research or in society .
chalmers is an aktiebolag with *num* shares à *num* , *num* sek , all of which are owned by the chalmers university of technology foundation , a private foundation , which appoints the university board and the president .
the foundation has its members appointed by the swedish government ( *num* to *num* seats ) , the departments appoints one member , the student union appoints one member and the president automatically gains one chair .
each department is led by a department head , usually a member of the faculty of that department .
the faculty senate represents members of the faculty when decisions are taken .
in *num* , the school moved from the city center to the new gibraltar campus , named after the mansion which owned the grounds , where it is now located .
the lindholmen college campus was created in the early 1990s and is located on the island hisingen .
campus johanneberg and campus lindholmen , as they are now called , are connected by bus lines .
traditions include the graduation ceremony and the cortège procession , an annual public event .
chalmers has partnerships with major industries mostly in the gothenburg region such as ericsson , volvo , and skf .
the university has general exchange agreements with many european and u .
s .
universities and maintains a special exchange program agreement with national chiao tung university ( nctu ) in taiwan where the exchange students from the two universities maintains offices for , among other things , helping local students with applying and preparing for an exchange year as well as acting as representatives .
it contributes also to the top industrial managers for europe ( time ) network .
a close collaboration between the department of computer science and engineering at chalmers and icvr at eth zurich is being established .
as of *num* , chalmers university of technology is a member of the idea league network .
in *num* , a benchmarking report from mit ranks chalmers top ten in the world of engineering education .
chalmers has also achieved the highest reputation for swedish universities by the kantar sifo's reputation index .
in the *num* international professional ranking of higher education institutions , which is established on the basis of the number of alumni holding a post of chief executive officer ( ceo ) or equivalent in one of the fortune global *num* companies , chalmers university of technology ranked *ord* in the world , ranking *ord* in sweden and *ord* in europe .
in the latest qs world university rankings ( *num* ) , the university was ranked *ord* in the world ( overall ) .
in the latest times higher education world university rankings ( *num* ) , chalmers ranked 201-250 of all global universities .
in the latest academic ranking of world universities ( *num* ) , the university was ranked between places 201-300 of all universities in the world .
although the official swedish title for the head is " rektor " , the university now uses " president " as the english translation .
commonwealth of england the commonwealth was the period from *num* to *num* when england and wales , later along with ireland and scotland , were ruled as a republic following the end of the second english civil war and the trial and execution of charles i .
the republic's existence was declared through " an act declaring england to be a commonwealth " , adopted by the rump parliament on *num* may *num* .
power in the early commonwealth was vested primarily in the parliament and a council of state .
during the period , fighting continued , particularly in ireland and scotland , between the parliamentary forces and those opposed to them , as part of what is now referred to as the third english civil war .
in *num* , after the forcible dissolution of the rump parliament , the army council adopted the instrument of government which made oliver cromwell lord protector of a united " commonwealth of england , scotland and ireland " , inaugurating the period now usually known as the protectorate .
after cromwell's death , and following a brief period of rule under his son , richard cromwell , the protectorate parliament was dissolved in *num* and the rump parliament recalled , the start of a process that led to the restoration of the monarchy in *num* .
the term commonwealth is sometimes used for the whole of *num* to *num* – a period referred to by monarchists as the interregnum – although for other historians , the use of the term is limited to the years prior to cromwell's formal assumption of power in *num* .
the rump was created by pride's purge of those members of the long parliament who did not support the political position of the grandees in the new model army .
just before and after the execution of king charles i on *num* january *num* , the rump passed a number of acts of parliament creating the legal basis for the republic .
with the abolition of the monarchy , privy council and the house of lords , it had unchecked executive and legislative power .
the english council of state , which replaced the privy council , took over many of the executive functions of the monarchy .
it was selected by the rump , and most of its members were mps .
however , the rump depended on the support of the army with which it had a very uneasy relationship .
after the execution of charles i , the house of commons abolished the monarchy and the house of lords .
it declared the people of england " and of all the dominions and territories thereunto belonging " to be henceforth under the governance of a " commonwealth " , effectively a republic .
in pride's purge , all members of parliament ( including most of the political presbyterians ) who would not accept the need to bring the king to trial had been removed .
thus the rump never had more than two hundred members ( less than half the number of the commons in the original long parliament ) .
they included : supporters of religious independents who did not want an established church and some of whom had sympathies with the levellers ; presbyterians who were willing to countenance the trial and execution of the king ; and later admissions , such as formerly excluded mps who were prepared to denounce the newport treaty negotiations with the king .
most rumpers were gentry , though there was a higher proportion of lesser gentry and lawyers than in previous parliaments .
less than one-quarter of them were regicides .
this left the rump as basically a conservative body whose vested interests in the existing land ownership and legal systems made it unlikely to want to reform them .
for the first two years of the commonwealth , the rump faced economic depression and the risk of invasion from scotland and ireland .
by *num* cromwell and the army had largely eliminated these threats .
there were many disagreements amongst factions of the rump .
some wanted a republic , but others favoured retaining some type of monarchical government .
most of england's traditional ruling classes regarded the rump as an illegal government made up of regicides and upstarts .
however , they were also aware that the rump might be all that stood in the way of an outright military dictatorship .
high taxes , mainly to pay the army , were resented by the gentry .
limited reforms were enough to antagonise the ruling class but not enough to satisfy the radicals .
despite its unpopularity , the rump was a link with the old constitution , and helped to settle england down and make it secure after the biggest upheaval in its history .
by *num* , france and spain had recognised england's new government .
though the church of england was retained , episcopacy was suppressed and the act of uniformity *num* was repealed in september *num* .
mainly on the insistence of the army , many independent churches were tolerated , although everyone still had to pay tithes to the established church .
some small improvements were made to law and court procedure ; for example , all court proceedings were now conducted in english rather than in law french or latin .
however , there were no widespread reforms of the common law .
this would have upset the gentry , who regarded the common law as reinforcing their status and property rights .
the rump passed many restrictive laws to regulate people's moral behaviour , such as closing down theatres and requiring strict observance of sunday .
this antagonised most of the gentry .
cromwell , aided by thomas harrison , forcibly dismissed the rump on *num* april *num* , for reasons that are unclear .
theories are that he feared the rump was trying to perpetuate itself as the government , or that the rump was preparing for an election which could return an anti-commonwealth majority .
many former members of the rump continued to regard themselves as england's only legitimate constitutional authority .
the rump had not agreed to its own dissolution ; their legal , constitutional view it was unlawful was based on charles ' concessionary act prohibiting the dissolution of parliament without its own consent ( on *num* may *num* , leading to the entire commonwealth being the latter years of the long parliament in their majority view ) .
the dissolution of the rump was followed by a short period in which cromwell and the army ruled alone .
nobody had the constitutional authority to call an election , but cromwell did not want to impose a military dictatorship .
instead , he ruled through a ' nominated assembly ' which he believed would be easy for the army to control since army officers did the nominating .
barebone's parliament was opposed by former rumpers and ridiculed by many gentries as being an assembly of ' inferior ' people .
however , over *num* of its *num* members were lesser gentry or of higher social status .
( an exception was praise-god barebone , a baptist merchant after whom the assembly got its derogatory nickname .
) many were well educated .
the assembly reflected the range of views of the officers who nominated it .
the radicals ( approximately *num* ) included a hard core of fifth monarchists who wanted to be rid of common law and any state control of religion .
the moderates ( approximately *num* ) wanted some improvements within the existing system and might move to either the radical or conservative side depending on the issue .
the conservatives ( approximately *num* ) wanted to keep the status quo ( since common law protected the interests of the gentry , and tithes and advowsons were valuable property ) .
cromwell saw barebone's parliament as a temporary legislative body which he hoped would produce reforms and develop a constitution for the commonwealth .
however , members were divided over key issues , only *num* had previous parliamentary experience , and although many had some legal training , there were no qualified lawyers .
cromwell seems to have expected this group of ' amateurs ' to produce reform without management or direction .
when the radicals mustered enough support to defeat a bill which would have preserved the status quo in religion , the conservatives , together with many moderates , surrendered their authority back to cromwell who sent soldiers to clear the rest of the assembly .
barebone's parliament was over .
commonwealth government under the barebones was officially by a council of state and parliament .
in *num* , oliver cromwell became lord protector under england's first written constitution the instrument of government , and then under the second and last written full constitutions , known as the humble petition and advice of *num* .
this meant executive power solely vested in the lord protector under a written and rewritten constitution that mandated that he summon triennial parliaments that should sit for several months each year .
on *num* april *num* , under the terms of the tender of union , the " ordinance for uniting scotland into one commonwealth with england " was issued by the lord protector and proclaimed in scotland by the military governor of scotland , general george monck , *ord* duke of albemarle .
the ordinance declared that " the people of scotland should be united with the people of england into one commonwealth and under one government " and decreed that a new " arms of the commonwealth " , incorporating the saltire , should be placed on " all the public seals , seals of office , and seals of bodies civil or corporate , in scotland " as " a badge of this union " .
on the death of oliver cromwell in *num* , his son , richard cromwell , inherited the title , lord protector .
internal divisions among the republican faction and quiet lobbying by moderates led to his resignation , the end of the protectorate and a second brief spell of commonwealth government by a council of state and parliament .
the protectorate might have continued if cromwell's son richard , who was made lord protector on his father's death , had been capable of carrying on his father's policies .
richard cromwell's main weakness was that he did not have the confidence of the new model army .
after seven months the grandees in the new model army removed him and , on *num* may *num* , they reinstalled the rump parliament .
charles fleetwood was appointed a member of the committee of safety and of the council of state , and one of the seven commissioners for the army .
on *num* june he was nominated lord-general ( commander-in-chief ) of the army .
however , his power was undermined in parliament , which chose to disregard the army's authority in a similar fashion to the pre–civil war parliament .
on *num* october *num* the commons cashiered general john lambert and other officers , and installed fleetwood as chief of a military council under the authority of the speaker .
the next day lambert ordered that the doors of the house be shut and the members kept out .
on *num* october a " committee of safety " was appointed , of which fleetwood and lambert were members .
lambert was appointed major-general of all the forces in england and scotland , fleetwood being general .
lambert was now sent , by the committee of safety , with a large force to meet george monck , who was in command of the english forces in scotland , and either negotiate with him or force him to come to terms .
it was into this atmosphere that general george monck marched south with his army from scotland .
lambert's army began to desert him , and he returned to london almost alone .
on *num* february *num* , monck reinstated the presbyterian members of the long parliament ' secluded ' by pride , so that they could prepare legislation for a new parliament .
fleetwood was deprived of his command and ordered to appear before parliament to answer for his conduct .
on *num* march lambert was sent to the tower , from which he escaped a month later .
lambert tried to rekindle the civil war in favour of the commonwealth by issuing a proclamation calling on all supporters of the " good old cause " to rally on the battlefield of edgehill .
but he was recaptured by colonel richard ingoldsby , a regicide who hoped to win a pardon by handing lambert over to the new regime .
the long parliament dissolved itself on *num* march .
on *num* april *num* , in response to a secret message sent by monck , charles ii issued the declaration of breda , which made known the conditions of his acceptance of the crown of england .
monck organised the convention parliament , which met for the first time on *num* april .
on *num* may it proclaimed that king charles ii had been the lawful monarch since the execution of charles i in january *num* .
charles returned from exile on *num* may .
he entered london on *num* may , his birthday .
to celebrate " his majesty's return to his parliament " *num* may was made a public holiday , popularly known as oak apple day .
he was crowned at westminster abbey on *num* april *num* .
floating-point arithmetic in computing , floating-point arithmetic ( fp ) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision .
for this reason , floating-point computation is often found in systems which include very small and very large real numbers , which require fast processing times .
a number is , in general , represented approximately to a fixed number of significant digits ( the significand ) and scaled using an exponent in some fixed base ; the base for the scaling is normally two , ten , or sixteen .
a number that can be represented exactly is of the following form : where significand is an integer , base is an integer greater than or equal to two , and exponent is also an integer .
for example : the term " floating point " refers to the fact that a number's radix point ( " decimal point " , or , more commonly in computers , " binary point " ) can " float " ; that is , it can be placed anywhere relative to the significant digits of the number .
this position is indicated as the exponent component , and thus the floating-point representation can be thought of as a kind of scientific notation .
a floating-point system can be used to represent , with a fixed number of digits , numbers of different orders of magnitude : e .
g .
the distance between galaxies or the diameter of an atomic nucleus can be expressed with the same unit of length .
the result of this dynamic range is that the numbers that can be represented are not uniformly spaced ; the difference between two consecutive representable numbers grows with the chosen scale .
over the years , a variety of floating-point representations have been used in computers .
in *num* , the ieee *num* standard for floating-point arithmetic was established , and since the 1990s , the most commonly encountered representations are those defined by the ieee .
the speed of floating-point operations , commonly measured in terms of flops , is an important characteristic of a computer system , especially for applications that involve intensive mathematical calculations .
a floating-point unit ( fpu , colloquially a math coprocessor ) is a part of a computer system specially designed to carry out operations on floating-point numbers .
a number representation specifies some way of encoding a number , usually as a string of digits .
there are several mechanisms by which strings of digits can represent numbers .
in common mathematical notation , the digit string can be of any length , and the location of the radix point is indicated by placing an explicit " point " character ( dot or comma ) there .
if the radix point is not specified , then the string implicitly represents an integer and the unstated radix point would be off the right-hand end of the string , next to the least significant digit .
in fixed-point systems , a position in the string is specified for the radix point .
so a fixed-point scheme might be to use a string of *num* decimal digits with the decimal point in the middle , whereby " *num* " would represent *num* .
*num* .
in scientific notation , the given number is scaled by a power of *num* , so that it lies within a certain range—typically between *num* and *num* , with the radix point appearing immediately after the first digit .
the scaling factor , as a power of ten , is then indicated separately at the end of the number .
for example , the orbital period of jupiter's moon io is seconds , a value that would be represented in standard-form scientific notation as seconds .
floating-point representation is similar in concept to scientific notation .
logically , a floating-point number consists of : to derive the value of the floating-point number , the " significand " is multiplied by the " base " raised to the power of the " exponent " , equivalent to shifting the radix point from its implied position by a number of places equal to the value of the exponent—to the right if the exponent is positive or to the left if the exponent is negative .
using base-10 ( the familiar decimal notation ) as an example , the number , which has ten decimal digits of precision , is represented as the significand together with *num* as the exponent .
to determine the actual value , a decimal point is placed after the first digit of the significand and the result is multiplied by to give , or .
in storing such a number , the base ( *num* ) need not be stored , since it will be the same for the entire range of supported numbers , and can thus be inferred .
symbolically , this final value is : where is the significand ( ignoring any implied decimal point ) , is the precision ( the number of digits in the significand ) , is the base ( in our example , this is the number " ten " ) , and is the exponent .
historically , several number bases have been used for representing floating-point numbers , with base two ( binary ) being the most common , followed by base ten ( decimal floating point ) , and other less common varieties , such as base sixteen ( hexadecimal floating point ) , eight ( octal floating point ) , base three ( balanced ternary floating point ) and even base .
a floating-point number is a rational number , because it can be represented as one integer divided by another ; for example is ( *num* / *num* ) ×1000 or / *num* .
the base determines the fractions that can be represented ; for instance , *num* / *num* cannot be represented exactly as a floating-point number using a binary base , but *num* / *num* can be represented exactly using a decimal base ( , or ) .
however , *num* / *num* cannot be represented exactly by either binary ( *num* .
*num* .
.
.
) or decimal ( *num* .
*num* .
.
.
) , but in base *num* , it is trivial ( *num* .
*num* or 1×3 ) .
the occasions on which infinite expansions occur depend on the base and its prime factors .
the way in which the significand ( including its sign ) and exponent are stored in a computer is implementation-dependent .
the common ieee formats are described in detail later and elsewhere , but as an example , in the binary single-precision ( 32-bit ) floating-point representation , formula_4 , and so the significand is a string of *num* bits .
for instance , the number π's first *num* bits are : in this binary expansion , let us denote the positions from *num* ( leftmost bit , or most significant bit ) to *num* ( rightmost bit ) .
the 24-bit significand will stop at position *num* , shown as the underlined bit above .
the next bit , at position *num* , is called the " round bit " or " rounding bit " .
it is used to round the 33-bit approximation to the nearest 24-bit number ( there are specific rules for halfway values , which is not the case here ) .
this bit , which is in this example , is added to the integer formed by the leftmost *num* bits , yielding : when this is stored in memory using the ieee *num* encoding , this becomes the significand .
the significand is assumed to have a binary point to the right of the leftmost bit .
so , the binary representation of π is calculated from left-to-right as follows : where is the precision ( in this example ) , is the position of the bit of the significand from the left ( starting at and finishing at here ) and is the exponent ( in this example ) .
it can be required that the most significant digit of the significand of a non-zero number be non-zero ( except when the corresponding exponent would be smaller than the minimum one ) .
this process is called " normalization " .
for binary formats ( which uses only the digits and ) , this non-zero digit is necessarily .
therefore , it does not need to be represented in memory ; allowing the format to have one more bit of precision .
this rule is variously called the " leading bit convention " , the " implicit bit convention " , the " hidden bit convention " , or the " assumed bit convention " .
the floating-point representation is by far the most common way of representing in computers an approximation to real numbers .
however , there are alternatives : in *num* , leonardo torres y quevedo designed an electro-mechanical version of charles babbage's analytical engine , and included floating-point arithmetic .
in *num* , konrad zuse of berlin completed the z1 , the first binary , programmable mechanical computer ; it uses a 24-bit binary floating-point number representation with a 7-bit signed exponent , a 17-bit significand ( including one implicit bit ) , and a sign bit .
the more reliable relay-based z3 , completed in *num* , has representations for both positive and negative infinities ; in particular , it implements defined operations with infinity , such as formula_11 , and it stops on undefined operations , such as formula_12 .
zuse also proposed , but did not complete , carefully rounded floating-point arithmetic that includes formula_13 and nan representations , anticipating features of the ieee standard by four decades .
in contrast , von neumann recommended against floating-point numbers for the *num* ias machine , arguing that fixed-point arithmetic is preferable .
the first " commercial " computer with floating-point hardware was zuse's z4 computer , designed in 1942–1945 .
in *num* , bell laboratories introduced the mark v , which implemented decimal floating-point numbers .
the pilot ace has binary floating-point arithmetic , and it became operational in *num* at national physical laboratory , uk .
thirty-three were later sold commercially as the english electric deuce .
the arithmetic is actually implemented in software , but with a one megahertz clock rate , the speed of floating-point and fixed-point operations in this machine were initially faster than those of many competing computers .
the mass-produced ibm *num* followed in *num* ; it introduced the use of a biased exponent .
for many decades after that , floating-point hardware was typically an optional feature , and computers that had it were said to be " scientific computers " , or to have " scientific computation " ( sc ) capability ( see also extensions for scientific computation ( xsc ) ) .
it was not until the launch of the intel i486 in *num* that " general-purpose " personal computers had floating-point capability in hardware as a standard feature .
the univac *num* / *num* series , introduced in *num* , supported two floating-point representations : the ibm *num* , also introduced in *num* , supports single-precision and double-precision representations , but with no relation to the univac's representations .
indeed , in *num* , ibm introduced hexadecimal floating-point representations in its system / *num* mainframes ; these same representations are still available for use in modern z / architecture systems .
however , in *num* , ibm included ieee-compatible binary floating-point arithmetic to its mainframes ; in *num* , ibm also added ieee-compatible decimal floating-point arithmetic .
initially , computers used many different representations for floating-point numbers .
the lack of standardization at the mainframe level was an ongoing problem by the early 1970s for those writing and maintaining higher-level source code ; these manufacturer floating-point standards differed in the word sizes , the representations , and the rounding behavior and general accuracy of operations .
floating-point compatibility across multiple computing systems was in desperate need of standardization by the early 1980s , leading to the creation of the ieee *num* standard once the 32-bit ( or 64-bit ) word had become commonplace .
this standard was significantly based on a proposal from intel , which was designing the i8087 numerical coprocessor ; motorola , which was designing the *num* around the same time , gave significant input as well .
in *num* , mathematician and computer scientist william kahan was honored with the turing award for being the primary architect behind this proposal ; he was aided by his student ( jerome coonen ) and a visiting professor ( harold stone ) .
among the x86 innovations are these : a floating-point number consists of two fixed-point components , whose range depends exclusively on the number of bits or digits in their representation .
whereas components linearly depend on their range , the floating-point range linearly depends on the significand range and exponentially on the range of exponent component , which attaches outstandingly wider range to the number .
on a typical computer system , a " double precision " ( 64-bit ) binary floating-point number has a coefficient of *num* bits ( including *num* implied bit ) , an exponent of *num* bits , and *num* sign bit .
since *num* = *num* , the complete range of floating-point numbers in this format is from approximately *num* ≈ *num* to *num* ≈ *num* ( see ieee *num* ) .
the number of normalized floating-point numbers in a system ( " b " , " p " , " l " , " u " ) where is formula_14 .
there is a smallest positive normalized floating-point number , which has a *num* as the leading digit and *num* for the remaining digits of the significand , and the smallest possible value for the exponent .
there is a largest floating-point number , which has " b " − *num* as the value for each digit of the significand and the largest possible value for the exponent .
in addition , there are representable values strictly between −ufl and ufl .
namely , positive and negative zeros , as well as denormalized numbers .
the ieee standardized the computer representation for binary floating-point numbers in ieee *num* ( a .
k .
a .
iec *num* ) in *num* .
this first standard is followed by almost all modern machines .
it was revised in *num* .
ibm mainframes support ibm's own hexadecimal floating point format and ieee 754-2008 decimal floating point in addition to the ieee *num* binary format .
the cray t90 series had an ieee version , but the sv1 still uses cray floating-point format .
the standard provides for many closely related formats , differing in only a few details .
five of these formats are called " basic formats " and others are termed " extended formats " ; three of these are especially widely used in computer hardware and languages : increasing the precision of the floating point representation generally reduces the amount of accumulated round-off error caused by intermediate calculations .
less common ieee formats include : any integer with absolute value less than *num* can be exactly represented in the single precision format , and any integer with absolute value less than *num* can be exactly represented in the double precision format .
furthermore , a wide range of powers of *num* times such a number can be represented .
these properties are sometimes used for purely integer data , to get 53-bit integers on platforms that have double precision floats but only 32-bit integers .
the standard specifies some special values , and their representation : positive infinity ( +∞ ) , negative infinity ( −∞ ) , a negative zero ( −0 ) distinct from ordinary ( " positive " ) zero , and " not a number " values ( nans ) .
comparison of floating-point numbers , as defined by the ieee standard , is a bit different from usual integer comparison .
negative and positive zero compare equal , and every nan compares unequal to every value , including itself .
all values except nan are strictly smaller than +∞ and strictly greater than −∞ .
finite floating-point numbers are ordered in the same way as their values ( in the set of real numbers ) .
floating-point numbers are typically packed into a computer datum as the sign bit , the exponent field , and the significand or mantissa , from left to right .
for the ieee *num* binary formats ( basic and extended ) which have extant hardware implementations , they are apportioned as follows : while the exponent can be positive or negative , in binary formats it is stored as an unsigned number that has a fixed " bias " added to it .
values of all 0s in this field are reserved for the zeros and subnormal numbers ; values of all 1s are reserved for the infinities and nans .
the exponent range for normalized numbers is [ −126 , *num* ] for single precision , [ −1022 , *num* ] for double , or [ −16382 , *num* ] for quad .
normalized numbers exclude subnormal values , zeros , infinities , and nans .
in the ieee binary interchange formats the leading *num* bit of a normalized significand is not actually stored in the computer datum .
it is called the " hidden " or " implicit " bit .
because of this , single precision format actually has a significand with *num* bits of precision , double precision format has *num* , and quad has *num* .
for example , it was shown above that π , rounded to *num* bits of precision , has : the sum of the exponent bias ( *num* ) and the exponent ( *num* ) is *num* , so this is represented in single precision format as in the ieee *num* standard , zero is signed , meaning that there exist both a " positive zero " ( +0 ) and a " negative zero " ( −0 ) .
in most run-time environments , positive zero is usually printed as " *num* " and the negative zero as " -0 " .
the two values behave as equal in numerical comparisons , but some operations return different results for +0 and −0 .
for instance , *num* / ( −0 ) returns negative infinity , while *num* / +0 returns positive infinity ( so that the identity *num* / ( *num* / ±∞ ) = ±∞ is maintained ) .
other common functions with a discontinuity at " x"=0 which might treat +0 and −0 differently include log ( " x " ) , signum ( " x " ) , and the principal square root of for any negative number " y " .
as with any approximation scheme , operations involving " negative zero " can occasionally cause confusion .
for example , in ieee *num* , " x " = " y " does not always imply *num* / "x " = *num* / "y " , as *num* = −0 but *num* / *num* ≠ *num* / −0 .
subnormal values fill the underflow gap with values where the absolute distance between them is the same as for adjacent values just outside the underflow gap .
this is an improvement over the older practice to just have zero in the underflow gap , and where underflowing results were replaced by zero ( flush to zero ) .
modern floating-point hardware usually handles subnormal values ( as well as normal values ) , and does not require software emulation for subnormals .
the infinities of the extended real number line can be represented in ieee floating-point datatypes , just like ordinary floating-point values like *num* , *num* .
*num* , etc .
they are not error values in any way , though they are often ( but not always , as it depends on the rounding ) used as replacement values when there is an overflow .
upon a divide-by-zero exception , a positive or negative infinity is returned as an exact result .
an infinity can also be introduced as a numeral ( like c's " infinity " macro , or " ∞ " if the programming language allows that syntax ) .
ieee *num* requires infinities to be handled in a reasonable way , such as ieee *num* specifies a special value called " not a number " ( nan ) to be returned as the result of certain " invalid " operations , such as *num* / *num* , ∞×0 , or sqrt ( −1 ) .
in general , nans will be propagated i .
e .
most operations involving a nan will result in a nan , although functions that would give some defined result for any given floating-point value will do so for nans as well , e .
g .
nan ^ *num* = *num* .
there are two kinds of nans : the default " quiet " nans and , optionally , " signaling " nans .
a signaling nan in any arithmetic operation ( including numerical comparisons ) will cause an " invalid " exception to be signaled .
the representation of nans specified by the standard has some unspecified bits that could be used to encode the type or source of error ; but there is no standard for that encoding .
in theory , signaling nans could be used by a runtime system to flag uninitialized variables , or extend the floating-point numbers with other special values without slowing down the computations with ordinary values , although such extensions are not common .
it is a common misconception that the more esoteric features of the ieee *num* standard discussed here , such as extended formats , nan , infinities , subnormals etc .
, are only of interest to numerical analysts , or for advanced numerical applications ; in fact the opposite is true : these features are designed to give safe robust defaults for numerically unsophisticated programmers , in addition to supporting sophisticated numerical libraries by experts .
the key designer of ieee *num* , william kahan notes that it is incorrect to " .
.
.
[ deem ] features of ieee standard *num* for binary floating-point arithmetic that .
.
.
[ are ] not appreciated to be features usable by none but numerical experts .
the facts are quite the opposite .
in *num* those features were designed into the intel *num* to serve the widest possible market .
.
.
error-analysis tells us how to design floating-point arithmetic , like ieee standard *num* , moderately tolerant of well-meaning ignorance among programmers " .
by their nature , all numbers expressed in floating-point format are rational numbers with a terminating expansion in the relevant base ( for example , a terminating decimal expansion in base-10 , or a terminating binary expansion in base-2 ) .
irrational numbers , such as π or √2 , or non-terminating rational numbers , must be approximated .
the number of digits ( or bits ) of precision also limits the set of rational numbers that can be represented exactly .
for example , the number *num* cannot be exactly represented if only eight decimal digits of precision are available .
when a number is represented in some format ( such as a character string ) which is not a native floating-point representation supported in a computer implementation , then it will require a conversion before it can be used in that implementation .
if the number can be represented exactly in the floating-point format then the conversion is exact .
if there is not an exact representation then the conversion requires a choice of which floating-point number to use to represent the original value .
the representation chosen will have a different value from the original , and the value thus adjusted is called the " rounded value " .
whether or not a rational number has a terminating expansion depends on the base .
for example , in base-10 the number *num* / *num* has a terminating expansion ( *num* .
*num* ) while the number *num* / *num* does not ( *num* .
*num* .
.
.
) .
in base-2 only rationals with denominators that are powers of *num* ( such as *num* / *num* or *num* / *num* ) are terminating .
any rational with a denominator that has a prime factor other than *num* will have an infinite binary expansion .
this means that numbers which appear to be short and exact when written in decimal format may need to be approximated when converted to binary floating-point .
for example , the decimal number *num* .
*num* is not representable in binary floating-point of any finite precision ; the exact binary representation would have a " *num* " sequence continuing endlessly : where , as previously , " s " is the significand and " e " is the exponent .
when rounded to *num* bits this becomes which is actually *num* .
*num* in decimal .
as a further example , the real number π , represented in binary as an infinite sequence of bits is but is when approximated by rounding to a precision of *num* bits .
in binary single-precision floating-point , this is represented as " s" = *num* .
*num* with " e" = *num* .
this has a decimal value of whereas a more accurate approximation of the true value of π is the result of rounding differs from the true value by about *num* .
*num* parts per million , and matches the decimal representation of π in the first *num* digits .
the difference is the discretization error and is limited by the machine epsilon .
the arithmetical difference between two consecutive representable floating-point numbers which have the same exponent is called a unit in the last place ( ulp ) .
for example , if there is no representable number lying between the representable numbers *num* .
45a70c22 and *num* .
45a70c24 , the ulp is 2×16 , or *num* .
for numbers with a base-2 exponent part of *num* , i .
e .
numbers with an absolute value higher than or equal to *num* but lower than *num* , an ulp is exactly *num* or about *num* in single precision , and exactly *num* or about *num* in double precision .
the mandated behavior of ieee-compliant hardware is that the result be within one-half of a ulp .
rounding is used when the exact result of a floating-point operation ( or a conversion to floating-point format ) would need more digits than there are digits in the significand .
ieee *num* requires " correct rounding " : that is , the rounded result is as if infinitely precise arithmetic was used to compute the value and then rounded ( although in implementation only three extra bits are needed to ensure this ) .
there are several different rounding schemes ( or " rounding modes " ) .
historically , truncation was the typical approach .
since the introduction of ieee *num* , the default method ( " round to nearest , ties to even " , sometimes called banker's rounding ) is more commonly used .
this method rounds the ideal ( infinitely precise ) result of an arithmetic operation to the nearest representable value , and gives that representation as the result .
in the case of a tie , the value that would make the significand end in an even digit is chosen .
the ieee *num* standard requires the same rounding to be applied to all fundamental algebraic operations , including square root and conversions , when there is a numeric ( non-nan ) result .
it means that the results of ieee *num* operations are completely determined in all bits of the result , except for the representation of nans .
( " library " functions such as cosine and log are not mandated .
) alternative rounding options are also available .
ieee *num* specifies the following rounding modes : alternative modes are useful when the amount of error being introduced must be bounded .
applications that require a bounded error are multi-precision floating-point , and interval arithmetic .
the alternative rounding modes are also useful in diagnosing numerical instability : if the results of a subroutine vary substantially between rounding to + and − infinity then it is likely numerically unstable and affected by round-off error .
for ease of presentation and understanding , decimal radix with *num* digit precision will be used in the examples , as in the ieee *num* " decimal32 " format .
the fundamental principles are the same in any radix or precision , except that normalization is optional ( it does not affect the numerical value of the result ) .
here , " s " denotes the significand and " e " denotes the exponent .
a simple method to add floating-point numbers is to first represent them with the same exponent .
in the example below , the second number is shifted right by three digits , and one then proceeds with the usual addition method : in detail : this is the true result , the exact sum of the operands .
it will be rounded to seven digits and then normalized if necessary .
the final result is note that the lowest three digits of the second operand ( *num* ) are essentially lost .
this is round-off error .
in extreme cases , the sum of two non-zero numbers may be equal to one of them : in the above conceptual examples it would appear that a large number of extra digits would need to be provided by the adder to ensure correct rounding ; however , for binary addition or subtraction using careful implementation techniques only two extra " guard " bits and one extra " sticky " bit need to be carried beyond the precision of the operands .
another problem of loss of significance occurs when two nearly equal numbers are subtracted .
in the following example " e" = *num* ; " s" = *num* .
*num* and " e" = *num* ; " s" = *num* .
*num* are representations of the rationals *num* .
*num* and *num* .
*num* .
the best representation of this difference is " e" = −1 ; " s" = *num* .
*num* , which differs more than *num* % from " e" = −1 ; " s" = *num* .
*num* .
in extreme cases , all significant digits of precision can be lost ( although gradual underflow ensures that the result will not be zero unless the two operands were equal ) .
this " cancellation " illustrates the danger in assuming that all of the digits of a computed result are meaningful .
dealing with the consequences of these errors is a topic in numerical analysis ; see also accuracy problems .
to multiply , the significands are multiplied while the exponents are added , and the result is rounded and normalized .
similarly , division is accomplished by subtracting the divisor's exponent from the dividend's exponent , and dividing the dividend's significand by the divisor's significand .
there are no cancellation or absorption problems with multiplication or division , though small errors may accumulate as operations are performed in succession .
in practice , the way these operations are carried out in digital logic can be quite complex ( see booth's multiplication algorithm and division algorithm ) .
for a fast , simple method , see the horner method .
floating-point computation in a computer can run into three kinds of problems : prior to the ieee standard , such conditions usually caused the program to terminate , or triggered some kind of trap that the programmer might be able to catch .
how this worked was system-dependent , meaning that floating-point programs were not portable .
( note that the term " exception " as used in ieee *num* is a general term meaning an exceptional condition , which is not necessarily an error , and is a different usage to that typically defined in programming languages such as a c++ or java , in which an " exception " is an alternative flow of control , closer to what is termed a " trap " in ieee *num* terminology ) .
here , the required default method of handling exceptions according to ieee *num* is discussed ( the ieee *num* optional trapping and other " alternate exception handling " modes are not discussed ) .
arithmetic exceptions are ( by default ) required to be recorded in " sticky " status flag bits .
that they are " sticky " means that they are not reset by the next ( arithmetic ) operation , but stay set until explicitly reset .
the use of " sticky " flags thus allows for testing of exceptional conditions to be delayed until after a full floating-point expression or subroutine : without them exceptional conditions that could not be otherwise ignored would require explicit testing immediately after every floating-point operation .
by default , an operation always returns a result according to specification without interrupting computation .
for instance , *num* / *num* returns +∞ , while also setting the divide-by-zero flag bit ( this default of ∞ is designed so as to often return a finite result when used in subsequent operations and so be safely ignored ) .
the original ieee *num* standard , however , failed to recommend operations to handle such sets of arithmetic exception flag bits .
so while these were implemented in hardware , initially programming language implementations typically did not provide a means to access them ( apart from assembler ) .
over time some programming language standards ( e .
g .
, c99 / c11 and fortran ) have been updated to specify methods to access and change status flag bits .
the *num* version of the ieee *num* standard now specifies a few operations for accessing and handling the arithmetic flag bits .
the programming model is based on a single thread of execution and use of them by multiple threads has to be handled by a means outside of the standard ( e .
g .
c11 specifies that the flags have thread-local storage ) .
ieee *num* specifies five arithmetic exceptions that are to be recorded in the status flags ( " sticky bits " ) : the default return value for each of the exceptions is designed to give the correct result in the majority of cases such that the exceptions can be ignored in the majority of codes .
" inexact " returns a correctly rounded result , and " underflow " returns a denormalized small value and so can almost always be ignored .
" divide-by-zero " returns infinity exactly , which will typically then divide a finite number and so give zero , or else will give an " invalid " exception subsequently if not , and so can also typically be ignored .
for example , the effective resistance of n resistors in parallel ( see fig .
*num* ) is given by formula_17 .
if a short-circuit develops with formula_18 set to *num* , formula_19 will return +infinity which will give a final formula_20 of *num* , as expected ( see the continued fraction example of for another example ) .
"overflow " and " invalid " exceptions can typically not be ignored , but do not necessarily represent errors : for example , a root-finding routine , as part of its normal operation , may evaluate a passed-in function at values outside of its domain , returning nan and an " invalid " exception flag to be ignored until finding a useful start point .
the fact that floating-point numbers cannot precisely represent all real numbers , and that floating-point operations cannot precisely represent true arithmetic operations , leads to many surprising situations .
this is related to the finite precision with which computers generally represent numbers .
for example , the non-representability of *num* .
*num* and *num* .
*num* ( in binary ) means that the result of attempting to square *num* .
*num* is neither *num* .
*num* nor the representable number closest to it .
in 24-bit ( single precision ) representation , *num* .
*num* ( decimal ) was given previously as " e" = −4 ; " s" = *num* , which is squaring this number gives squaring it with single-precision floating-point hardware ( with rounding ) gives but the representable number closest to *num* .
*num* is also , the non-representability of π ( and π / *num* ) means that an attempted computation of tan ( π / *num* ) will not yield a result of infinity , nor will it even overflow .
it is simply not possible for standard floating-point hardware to attempt to compute tan ( π / *num* ) , because π / *num* cannot be represented exactly .
this computation in c : / * enough digits to be sure we get the correct approximation .
* / double pi = *num* .
*num* ; double z = tan ( pi / *num* .
*num* ) ; will give a result of *num* .
*num* .
in single precision ( using the tanf function ) , the result will be −22877332 .
*num* .
by the same token , an attempted computation of sin ( π ) will not yield zero .
the result will be ( approximately ) *num* .
*num* in double precision , or −0 .
*num* in single precision .
while floating-point addition and multiplication are both commutative ( " a " + " b " = " b " + " a " and " a " × " b " = " b " × " a " ) , they are not necessarily associative .
that is , ( " a " + " b " ) + " c " is not necessarily equal to " a " + ( " b " + " c " ) .
using 7-digit significand decimal arithmetic : they are also not necessarily distributive .
that is , ( " a " + " b " ) × " c " may not be the same as " a " × " c " + " b " × " c " : in addition to loss of significance , inability to represent numbers such as π and *num* .
*num* exactly , and other slight inaccuracies , the following phenomena may occur : "machine precision " is a quantity that characterizes the accuracy of a floating-point system , and is used in backward error analysis of floating-point algorithms .
it is also known as unit roundoff or " machine epsilon " .
usually denoted ε , its value depends on the particular rounding being used .
with rounding to zero , whereas rounding to nearest , this is important since it bounds the " relative error " in representing any non-zero real number x within the normalized range of a floating-point system : backward error analysis , the theory of which was developed and popularized by james h .
wilkinson , can be used to establish that an algorithm implementing a numerical function is numerically stable .
the basic approach is to show that although the calculated result , due to roundoff errors , will not be exactly correct , it is the exact solution to a nearby problem with slightly perturbed input data .
if the perturbation required is small , on the order of the uncertainty in the input data , then the results are in some sense as accurate as the data " deserves " .
the algorithm is then defined as " backward stable " .
stability is a measure of the sensitivity to rounding errors of a given numerical procedure ; by contrast , the condition number of a function for a given problem indicates the inherent sensitivity of the function to small perturbations in its input and is independent of the implementation used to solve the problem .
as a trivial example , consider a simple expression giving the inner product of ( length two ) vectors formula_25 and formula_26 , then and so which is the sum of two slightly perturbed ( on the order of ε ) input data , and so is backward stable .
for more realistic examples in numerical linear algebra , see higham *num* and other references below .
although , as noted previously , individual arithmetic operations of ieee *num* are guaranteed accurate to within half a ulp , more complicated formulae can suffer from larger errors due to round-off .
the loss of accuracy can be substantial if a problem or its data are ill-conditioned , meaning that the correct result is hypersensitive to tiny perturbations in its data .
however , even functions that are well-conditioned can suffer from large loss of accuracy if an algorithm numerically unstable for that data is used : apparently equivalent formulations of expressions in a programming language can differ markedly in their numerical stability .
one approach to remove the risk of such loss of accuracy is the design and analysis of numerically stable algorithms , which is an aim of the branch of mathematics known as numerical analysis .
another approach that can protect against the risk of numerical instabilities is the computation of intermediate ( scratch ) values in an algorithm at a higher precision than the final result requires , which can remove , or reduce by orders of magnitude , such risk : ieee *num* quadruple precision and extended precision are designed for this purpose when computing at double precision .
for example , the following algorithm is a direct implementation to compute the function a ( x ) = ( x−1 ) / ( exp ( x−1 ) − *num* ) which is well-conditioned at *num* .
*num* , however it can be shown to be numerically unstable and lose up to half the significant digits carried by the arithmetic when computed near *num* .
*num* .
double a ( double x ) if , however , intermediate computations are all performed in extended precision ( e .
g .
by setting line [ *num* ] to c99 long double ) , then up to full precision in the final double result can be maintained .
alternatively , a numerical analysis of the algorithm reveals that if the following non-obvious change to line [ *num* ] is made : then the algorithm becomes numerically stable and can compute to full double precision .
to maintain the properties of such carefully constructed numerically stable programs , careful handling by the compiler is required .
certain " optimizations " that compilers might make ( for example , reordering operations ) can work against the goals of well-behaved software .
there is some controversy about the failings of compilers and language designs in this area : c99 is an example of a language where such optimizations are carefully specified so as to maintain numerical precision .
see the external references at the bottom of this article .
a detailed treatment of the techniques for writing high-quality floating-point software is beyond the scope of this article , and the reader is referred to , and the other references at the bottom of this article .
kahan suggests several rules of thumb that can substantially decrease by orders of magnitude the risk of numerical anomalies , in addition to , or in lieu of , a more careful numerical analysis .
these include : as noted above , computing all expressions and intermediate results in the highest precision supported in hardware ( a common rule of thumb is to carry twice the precision of the desired result i .
e .
compute in double precision for a final single precision result , or in double extended or quad precision for up to double precision results ) ; and rounding input data and results to only the precision required and supported by the input data ( carrying excess precision in the final result beyond that required and supported by the input data can be misleading , increases storage cost and decreases speed , and the excess bits can affect convergence of numerical procedures : notably , the first form of the iterative example given below converges correctly when using this rule of thumb ) .
brief descriptions of several additional issues and techniques follow .
as decimal fractions can often not be exactly represented in binary floating-point , such arithmetic is at its best when it is simply being used to measure real-world quantities over a wide range of scales ( such as the orbital period of a moon around saturn or the mass of a proton ) , and at its worst when it is expected to model the interactions of quantities expressed as decimal strings that are expected to be exact .
an example of the latter case is financial calculations .
for this reason , financial software tends not to use a binary floating-point number representation .
the " decimal " data type of the c# and python programming languages , and the decimal formats of the ieee 754-2008 standard , are designed to avoid the problems of binary floating-point representations when applied to human-entered exact decimal values , and make the arithmetic always behave as expected when numbers are printed in decimal .
expectations from mathematics may not be realized in the field of floating-point computation .
for example , it is known that formula_39 , and that formula_40 , however these facts cannot be relied on when the quantities involved are the result of floating-point computation .
the use of the equality test ( codice_2 ) requires care when dealing with floating-point numbers .
even simple expressions like codice_3 will , on most computers , fail to be true ( in ieee *num* double precision , for example , codice_4 is approximately equal to -4 .
44089209850063e-16 ) .
consequently , such tests are sometimes replaced with " fuzzy " comparisons ( codice_5 , where epsilon is sufficiently small and tailored to the application , such as *num* .
0e−13 ) .
the wisdom of doing this varies greatly , and can require numerical analysis to bound epsilon .
values derived from the primary data representation and their comparisons should be performed in a wider , extended , precision to minimize the risk of such inconsistencies due to round-off errors .
it is often better to organize the code in such a way that such tests are unnecessary .
for example , in computational geometry , exact tests of whether a point lies off or on a line or plane defined by other points can be performed using adaptive precision or exact arithmetic methods .
small errors in floating-point arithmetic can grow when mathematical algorithms perform operations an enormous number of times .
a few examples are matrix inversion , eigenvector computation , and differential equation solving .
these algorithms must be very carefully designed , using numerical approaches such as iterative refinement , if they are to work well .
summation of a vector of floating-point values is a basic algorithm in scientific computing , and so an awareness of when loss of significance can occur is essential .
for example , if one is adding a very large number of numbers , the individual addends are very small compared with the sum .
this can lead to loss of significance .
a typical addition would then be something like the low *num* digits of the addends are effectively lost .
suppose , for example , that one needs to add many numbers , all approximately equal to *num* .
after *num* of them have been added , the running sum is about *num* ; the lost digits are not regained .
the kahan summation algorithm may be used to reduce the errors .
round-off error can affect the convergence and accuracy of iterative numerical procedures .
as an example , archimedes approximated π by calculating the perimeters of polygons inscribing and circumscribing a circle , starting with hexagons , and successively doubling the number of sides .
as noted above , computations may be rearranged in a way that is mathematically equivalent but less prone to error ( numerical analysis ) .
two forms of the recurrence formula for the circumscribed polygon are : here is a computation using ieee " double " ( a significand with *num* bits of precision ) arithmetic : while the two forms of the recurrence formula are clearly mathematically equivalent , the first subtracts *num* from a number extremely close to *num* , leading to an increasingly problematic loss of significant digits .
as the recurrence is applied repeatedly , the accuracy improves at first , but then it deteriorates .
it never gets better than about *num* digits , even though 53-bit arithmetic should be capable of about *num* digits of precision .
when the second form of the recurrence is used , the value converges to *num* digits of precision .
allotropy allotropy or allotropism ( ) is the property of some chemical elements to exist in two or more different forms , in the same physical state , known as " allotropes " of the elements .
allotropes are different structural modifications of an element ; the atoms of the element are bonded together in a different manner .
for example , the allotropes of carbon include diamond ( the carbon atoms are bonded together in a tetrahedral lattice arrangement ) , graphite ( the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a hexagonal lattice ) , graphene ( single sheets of graphite ) , and fullerenes ( the carbon atoms are bonded together in spherical , tubular , or ellipsoidal formations ) .
the term " allotropy " is used for elements only , not for compounds .
the more general term , used for any crystalline material , is polymorphism .
allotropy refers only to different forms of an element within the same phase ( i .
e .
: solid , liquid or gas states ) ; differences in these states alone would not constitute examples of allotropy .
for some elements , allotropes have different molecular formulae despite difference in phase ; for example , two allotropes of oxygen ( dioxygen , o , and ozone , o ) can both exist in the solid , liquid and gaseous states .
other elements do not maintain distinct allotropes in different phases ; for example , phosphorus has numerous solid allotropes , which all revert to the same p form when melted to the liquid state .
the concept of allotropy was originally proposed in *num* by the swedish scientist baron jöns jakob berzelius ( 1779–1848 ) .
the term is derived .
after the acceptance of avogadro's hypothesis in *num* , it was understood that elements could exist as polyatomic molecules , and two allotropes of oxygen were recognized as o and o .
in the early *ord* century , it was recognized that other cases such as carbon were due to differences in crystal structure .
by *num* , ostwald noted that the allotropy of elements is just a special case of the phenomenon of polymorphism known for compounds , and proposed that the terms allotrope and allotropy be abandoned and replaced by polymorph and polymorphism .
although many other chemists have repeated this advice , iupac and most chemistry texts still favour the usage of allotrope and allotropy for elements only .
allotropes are different structural forms of the same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical behaviours .
the change between allotropic forms is triggered by the same forces that affect other structures , i .
e .
, pressure , light , and temperature .
therefore , the stability of the particular allotropes depends on particular conditions .
for instance , iron changes from a body-centered cubic structure ( ferrite ) to a face-centered cubic structure ( austenite ) above *num* °c , and tin undergoes a modification known as tin pest from a metallic form to a semiconductor form below *num* .
*num* °c ( *num* .
*num* °f ) .
as an example of allotropes having different chemical behaviour , ozone ( o ) is a much stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen ( o ) .
typically , elements capable of variable coordination number and / or oxidation states tend to exhibit greater numbers of allotropic forms .
another contributing factor is the ability of an element to catenate .
examples of allotropes include : among the metallic elements that occur in nature in significant quantities ( *num* up to u , without tc and pm ) , almost half ( *num* ) are allotropic at ambient pressure : li , be , na , ca , ti , mn , fe , co , sr , y , zr , sn , la , ce , pr , nd , sm , gd , tb , dy , yb , hf , tl , th , pa and u .
some phase transitions between allotropic forms of technologically relevant metals are those of ti at *num* °c , fe at *num* °c and *num* °c , co at *num* °c , zr at *num* °c , sn at *num* °c and u at *num* °c and *num* °c .
in *num* , the concept of nanoallotropy was proposed by prof .
rafal klajn of the organic chemistry department of the weizmann institute of science .
nanoallotropes , or allotropes of nanomaterials , are nanoporous materials that have the same chemical composition ( e .
g .
, au ) , but differ in their architecture at the nanoscale ( that is , on a scale *num* to *num* times the dimensions of individual atoms ) .
such nanoallotropes may help create ultra-small electronic devices and find other industrial applications .
the different nanoscale architectures translate into different properties , as was demonstrated for surface-enhanced raman scattering performed on several different nanoallotropes of gold .
a two-step method for generating nanoallotropes was also created .
book of enos the book of enos is the fourth book of the book of mormon .
according to the text it was written by enos , a nephite prophet .
the short book consists of a single chapter and relates enos ' conversion after praying all day and all night , and his subsequent dialogue with the lord .
it also discusses the redemption of the nephites and their enemies , the lamanites .
the narrative of the book of enos is often used in the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints as an example of faith .
one time enos was hunting in the woods and he remembered the gospel according to his father , and he got on his knees and cried all day and into the night for the salvation of his soul .
then the voice of god told enos that his sins were forgiven .
enos believed the voice , but he was curious about how the forgiveness was actually accomplished .
god told enos he was forgiven because he had faith in christ , even though he never heard or saw christ , and indeed it would be far in the future before he came in the flesh .
enos then prayed for the salvation of the nephites , but god said they would be blessed or cursed according to how they obeyed the commandments .
enos , fearing that the nephites would refuse to obey the commandments of god , then prayed for the lamanites who oppressed them , that at least they would avoid destruction .
and he prayed that god would preserve a record of the nephites so that someday the lamanites too might be brought to salvation , even though anything the nephites said and did now in enos ' time would have nothing to do with salvation on that future day , but only faith in christ , whose death and resurrection would be in the past instead of the future .
nevertheless , god made a covenant with enos that he would bring the records of the nephites to the lamanites in due time .
enos took up the mantle of prophet and went among his people the nephites lest they be destroyed as god had warned .
enos does not say whether he was successful at converting the nephites back to the true faith , but he does say the nephites failed to convert the lamanites back to the true faith .
he characterized the lamanites as having a hatred that was fixed .
the lamanites were led by their evil nature to become a wild and bloodthirsty people .
they were full of idolatry and filthiness and fed upon beasts of prey .
they dwelt in tents , wandered about in the wilderness , wore a short skin girdle about their loins and their heads were shaven .
their skill was in the bow , and in the cimeter , and the ax .
many of them ate nothing except raw meat .
they were continually seeking to destroy the nephites who tilled the land , grew fruit in orchards , and tended flocks of cattle and goats and horses .
list of games based on dune a number of games have been published which are based on the " dune " universe created by frank herbert .
to date , there have been five licensed " dune"-related video games released .
there have also been many " dune"-based muds ( multi-user dimension ) and browser-based online games , all created and run by fans .
1992's " dune " from cryo interactive / virgin interactive blends adventure with strategy .
loosely following the story of the *num* novel " dune " and using many visual elements from the *num* film of the same name by david lynch , the game casts the player as paul atreides , with the ultimate goal of driving the harkonnens from the planet dune and taking control of its valuable export , the spice .
key to success is the management of spice mining , military forces , and ecology as the player amasses allies and skills .
"dune ii : the building of a dynasty " , later retitled " dune ii : battle for arrakis " for the mega drive / genesis port , was released in december *num* from westwood studios / virgin interactive .
often considered to be the first " mainstream modern real-time strategy game " , " dune ii " established many conventions of the genre .
only loosely connected to the plot of the novels or films , the game pits three interplanetary houses — the atreides , the harkonnens , and the ordos — against each other for control of the planet arrakis and its valuable spice , all while fending off the destructive natural forces of the harsh desert planet itself .
"dune *num* " , a *num* remake of " dune ii " from intelligent games / westwood studios / virgin interactive , added improved graphics and live-action cutscenes .
though gameplay is similar to its predecessor , " dune *num* " features an enhanced storyline and functionality .
"emperor : battle for dune " ( intelligent games / westwood studios / electronic arts ) was released on june *num* , *num* .
a sequel to " dune *num* " , the real-time strategy game features 3d graphics and live-action cutscenes and casts players as atreides , harkonnens , or ordos .
released in *num* by cryo interactive / dreamcatcher interactive , " frank herbert's dune " is a 3d video game based on the *num* sci fi channel miniseries of the same name .
as paul muad'dib atreides , the player must become leader of the fremen , seize control of dune , and defeat the evil baron harkonnen .
the game was not a commercial or critical success , and cryo subsequently filed for bankruptcy in july *num* .
in *num* , cryonetworks disclosed information about " dune generations " , an online , 3d real-time strategy game set in the " dune " universe .
an official website for the upcoming game featured concept images , a brief background story and description of the persistent gameworld , and a list of frequently asked questions .
the game would be constructed using cryo's own online multimedia development framework scol .
within " the infrastructure of a permanent and massive multiplayer world that exists online , " " dune generations " would let players assume control of a dynasty in the " dune " universe , with the goal of first mastering the natural resources of their own homeworlds and ultimately rising in power and influence through conflicts and alliances with other player dynasties .
each of the three available dynasty types — traders , soldiers , or mercenaries — would provide a different playing experience , all with the long-term goal of gaining control of arrakis and its valuable spice .
a preview video trailer was released in november *num* .
the game was still in the alpha testing stage in february *num* , and the project was ultimately halted after cryo filed for bankruptcy in july *num* .
the " dune wars " mod is a total conversion of " " to the " dune " setting .
the mod was featured by tom chick in the relauched tom vs bruce series .
in *num* an updated version of the mod called " dune wars : revival " was released .
based on the pennmush text environment the popular multi-user shared hallucination , dunemush , began in december *num* and ran through august *num* .
another mush , dune iii , was later created on mushpark .
its timeline was set *num* years prior to that of the novel , and ran for a few years before closing in *num* .
around since *num* , dune mud is a text based virtual environment that promotes the hack and slash gameplay mechanic .
started in september *num* , sss is a game starting in the year *num* a .

the age of pretenders has ended but the imperium is still clawing its way back to prominence under emperor corrin xiii .
rife with intrigue this message board game features functioning landsraad and choam councils as well as a flourishing imperial news system and many robust , unique houses from cadets of the emperor's family all the way down to individuals with something to prove .
in june *num* the game began its campaign to re-take ix , marking a major plot point .
lhop people the lhop or doya people are a little-known tribe of southwest bhutan .
the bhutanese believe them to be the aboriginal inhabitants of the country .
the lhop are found in the low valleys of dorokha gewog , samtse and near phuntsholing in the duars .
the dress of the lhop resembles the lepcha , but they bear little similarity with the bhutia in the north and the toto in the west .
the doya trace their descent matrilineally , marry their cross cousins , and embalm the deceased who are then placed in a foetal position in a circular sarcophagus above the ground .
they follow a blend of tibetan buddhism mixed with animism .

he served until september *num* , and then attended yale university , graduating in *num* .
he moved his family to west texas where he entered the oil business and became a millionaire by the age of *num* in *num* .
after founding his own oil company , bush was defeated in his first run for the united states senate in *num* , but won election to the house of representatives from in *num* .
he was reelected in *num* but was defeated for election to the senate in *num* .
in *num* , president richard nixon appointed bush as ambassador to the united nations , and he became chairman of the republican national committee in *num* .
the following year , president gerald ford appointed him chief of the liaison office in china and later made him the director of central intelligence .
bush ran for president in *num* , was defeated in the republican primary by ronald reagan , and then as reagan's running mate bush became vice-president after the ticket's election .
during his eight-year tenure as vice president , bush headed task forces on deregulation and the war on drugs .
bush in *num* defeated democratic opponent michael dukakis , becoming the first incumbent vice president to be elected president in *num* years .
foreign policy drove the bush presidency ; military operations were conducted in panama and the persian gulf , the berlin wall fell in *num* , and the soviet union dissolved two years later .
bush also signed the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) , which created a trade bloc consisting of the united states , canada , and mexico .
domestically , bush reneged on and signed a bill to increase taxes .
he lost the *num* presidential election to democrat bill clinton following an economic recession and the decreased importance of foreign policy in a post–cold war political climate .
after leaving office in *num* , bush was active in humanitarian activities , often alongside clinton , his former opponent .
with george w .
bush's victory in the *num* presidential election , bush and his son became the second father–son pair to serve as president , following john adams and john quincy adams .
george herbert walker bush was born at *num* adams street in milton , massachusetts on june *num* , *num* to prescott sheldon bush and dorothy ( walker ) bush .
the bush family moved from milton to greenwich , connecticut shortly after his birth .
bush was named after his maternal grandfather george herbert walker , who was known as " pop " , and young bush was called " poppy " as a tribute to his namesake .
bush began his formal education at the greenwich country day school , then attended phillips academy in andover , massachusetts beginning in *num* , where he held a number of leadership positions which included president of the senior class , secretary of the student council , president of the community fund-raising group , a member of the editorial board of the school newspaper , and captain of the varsity baseball and soccer teams .
six months after the united states entered world war ii following japan's attack on pearl harbor , bush enlisted in the u .
s .
navy immediately after he graduated from phillips academy on his *ord* birthday .
he became a naval aviator , taking training for aircraft carrier operations aboard uss " sable " .
after completing the *ord* course , he was commissioned as an ensign in the naval reserve at naval air station corpus christi on june *num* , *num* , just three days before his *ord* birthday , which made him one of the youngest aviators in the navy .
in september *num* , he was assigned to torpedo squadron *num* ( vt-51 ) as the photographic officer .
the following year , his squadron was based in as a member of air group *num* , where his lanky physique earned him the nickname " skin " .
during this time , the task force was victorious at the battle of the philippine sea , one of the largest air battles of world war ii .
bush was promoted to lieutenant ( junior grade ) on august *num* , *num* , and " san jacinto " commenced operations against the japanese in the bonin islands .
he piloted one of the four grumman tbm avengers of vt-51 that attacked the japanese installations on chichijima on september *num* , *num* .
his crew included radioman second class john delaney and lt .
( jg ) william white .
his aircraft was hit by flak during the attack , but bush successfully released bombs and scored several hits .
with his engine ablaze , he flew several miles from the island , where he and one other crew member bailed out ; the other man's parachute did not open .
bush spent four hours in an inflated raft , protected by fighter aircraft circling above , until the submarine came to his rescue .
he remained in " finback " for the next month and participated in the rescue of other aviators .
several of those shot down during the attack were executed , and their livers were eaten by their captors .
this experience shaped bush profoundly , leading him to ask , " why had i been spared and what did god have for me ? " in november *num* , bush returned to " san jacinto " and participated in operations in the philippines until his squadron was replaced and sent home to the united states .
by *num* he had flown *num* combat missions for which he received the distinguished flying cross , three air medals , and the presidential unit citation awarded to " san jacinto " .
he was then reassigned to a training wing for torpedo bomber crews at norfolk navy base , virginia .
his final assignment was to the new torpedo squadron vt-153 based at naval air station grosse ile , michigan .
he was honorably discharged from the navy in september *num* , one month after the surrender of japan .
when bush was still in the navy , he married barbara pierce ( 1925–2018 ) in rye , new york , on january *num* , *num* .
the marriage produced six children : george w .
( b .
*num* ) , robin ( 1949–1953 ) , jeb ( b .
*num* ) , neil ( b .
*num* ) , marvin ( b .
*num* ) , and doro ( b .
*num* ) .
at the time of his wife's death on april *num* , *num* , george h .
w .
had been married to barbara for *num* years ; theirs was the longest presidential marriage in american history .
they had become the longest-married presidential couple in *num* when their marriage surpassed the 54-year ( 1764–1818 ) marriage of john and abigail adams .
after bush received his military discharge , he enrolled at yale university .
he earned an undergraduate degree in economics on an accelerated program that enabled him to graduate in two and a half years , rather than the usual four .
he was a member of the delta kappa epsilon fraternity and was elected its president .
he also captained the yale baseball team and played in the first two college world series as a left-handed first baseman .
bush was the team captain during his senior year in *num* , and he met babe ruth before a game ; the event took place only weeks before ruth's death .
like his father , he was also a member of the yale cheerleading squad .
late in his junior year , he was initiated into the skull and bones secret society ; his father prescott bush had been initiated into the same society in *num* .
he was elected to phi beta kappa when he graduated from yale in *num* with a bachelor of arts degree in economics .
after graduating from yale , bush moved his young family to west texas .
his father's business connections proved useful as he ventured into the oil business , starting as an oil field equipment salesman for dresser industries , a subsidiary of brown brothers harriman & co .
, where prescott bush had served on the board of directors for *num* years .
while working for dresser , bush lived in various places with his family : odessa , texas ; ventura , bakersfield and compton , california ; and midland , texas .
according to eldest son george w .
bush , then age two , the family lived in one of the few duplexes in odessa with an indoor bathroom , which they " shared with a couple of hookers " .
bush started the bush-overbey oil development company in *num* and in *num* co-founded the zapata petroleum corporation , an oil company that drilled in the permian basin in texas .
in *num* , he was named president of the zapata offshore company , a subsidiary which specialized in offshore drilling .
shortly after the subsidiary became independent in *num* , bush moved the company and his family from midland to houston .
beginning in *num* or *num* , bush was a clandestine employee or agent of the united states central intelligence agency using as cover his work in the petroleum production business .
in that role , he appears to have been associated with cia-affiliated anti-castro cubans who had been involved in the failed bay of pigs invasion .
when confronted with a *num* federal bureau of investigation memorandum evidencing his being a cia operative , bush issued a non-denial denial .
bush continued serving as president of the company until *num* , and later chairman until *num* , when he won election to the u .
s .
house of representatives .
by that time , bush had become a millionaire .
bush's career in politics began on february *num* , *num* when he was elected chairman of the harris county , texas republican party .
the following year , he ran against incumbent democrat ralph w .
yarborough in the u .
s .
senate race .
he was a young conservative republican in contrast to the aging liberal democrat yarborough , and campaigned against pending civil rights legislation , believing it gave too much power to the federal government .
bush lost the election *num* % to *num* % , though he did outpoll republican presidential nominee barry goldwater , who lost by an overwhelming margin to lyndon b .
johnson .
bush and the harris county republicans played a role in the development of the new republican party of the late *ord* century .
bush worked to absorb the john birch society members , who were trying to take over the party .
also , as a result of the civil rights movement , democrats in the south who were committed to segregation left their party , and though these " country club republicans " had differing ideological beliefs , they found common ground in hoping to expel the democrats from power .
in *num* , bush was elected to a seat in the united states house of representatives from the *ord* district of texas ; he won *num* percent of the ballots cast in a race against democrat frank briscoe , the district attorney of harris county .
bush was the first house republican to represent his houston district , including his residence in the tanglewood ; his voting record in the house was generally conservative : bush voted for the civil rights act of *num* , although it was generally unpopular in his district .
he supported the nixon administration's vietnam policies , but broke with republicans on the issue of birth control , which he supported .
despite being a first-term congressman , bush was appointed to the powerful united states house committee on ways and means , where he voted to abolish the military draft .
he was elected to a second term in *num* .
in *num* , nixon convinced bush to relinquish his house seat in order to run for the senate against ralph yarborough , who was a fierce nixon critic .
in the republican primary , bush easily defeated conservative robert j .
morris by a margin of *num* .
*num* % to *num* .
*num* % .
nixon went to longview , texas , to campaign for bush and gubernatorial candidate paul eggers , a dallas lawyer who was a close friend of u .
s .
senator john g .
tower .
former congressman lloyd bentsen , a more moderate democrat and native of mission in south texas , defeated yarborough in the democratic primary .
yarborough endorsed bentsen , who went on to defeat bush , *num* .
*num* to *num* .
*num* % .
following his *num* loss , bush was well known as a prominent republican businessman from the southern sun belt .
nixon appreciated the sacrifice bush had made of his congressional position and nominated him united states ambassador to the united nations .
he was confirmed unanimously by the senate in *num* and served for two years .
his ambassadorship was marked by a defeat on the china question .
on october *num* , *num* , the general assembly voted to expel the republic of china and replace it with the people's republic of china .
many delegates hissed at bush when he got up to speak , and then cheered and danced after defeating his motion to require a two-thirds supermajority .
the resolution then won a two-thirds supermajority anyway , as the united states lost the support of every nato country .
although bush condemned the " gladiatorial ugliness " of the debate , he advocated friendly relations with the chinese delegation .
two months later , bush even placed himself in the position of depending on a chinese veto in the *num* secretary-general selection .
however he did not tell the chinese , who unexpectedly abstained and allowed kurt waldheim to be selected as the next secretary-general of the united nations .
after bob dole resigned as chairman of the republican national committee in *num* , nixon named bush to the position .
bush took over in january *num* and held this position as the watergate scandal grew more damaging to nixon .
he initially defended nixon steadfastly , but as nixon's complicity became clear he focused more on defending the republican party .
as chairman , bush formally requested that nixon eventually resign for the good of the party .
when nixon did this on august *num* , *num* , bush noted in his diary that " there was an aura of sadness , like somebody died .
.
.
the [ resignation ] speech was vintage nixon—a kick or two at the press—enormous strains .
one couldn't help but look at the family and the whole thing and think of his accomplishments and then think of the shame .
.
.
[ president gerald ford's swearing-in offered ] indeed a new spirit , a new lift .
" president gerald ford appointed bush to be chief of the u .
s .
liaison office in the people's republic of china .
since the united states maintained diplomatic relations with the republic of china ( taiwan ) instead of the people's republic of china , bush did not hold the diplomatic rank of ambassador .
however , bush performed as an ambassador , ignoring instructions from henry kissinger to stay away from diplomatic functions .
the *num* months that he spent in china were seen as beneficial for china–united states relations .
after ford assumed the presidency , bush was under serious consideration for being nominated as vice president .
ford eventually narrowed his list to nelson rockefeller and bush .
white house chief of staff donald rumsfeld reportedly preferred rockefeller over bush .
rockefeller was finally named and confirmed .
ford again passed over bush when he chose bob dole to replace rockefeller on the *num* presidential ticket .
in *num* ford brought bush back to washington to become director of central intelligence ( dci ) , replacing william colby .
he served in this role for *num* days , from january *num* , *num* , to january *num* , *num* .
the central intelligence agency ( cia ) had been rocked by a series of revelations , including those based on investigations by the church committee regarding illegal and unauthorized activities by the cia , and bush was credited with helping to restore the agency's morale .
in his capacity as dci , bush gave national security briefings to jimmy carter both as a presidential candidate and as president-elect , and discussed the possibility of remaining in that position in a carter administration , but did not do so .
he was succeeded by deputy director of central intelligence e .
henry knoche , who served as acting director of central intelligence until stansfield turner was confirmed .
during bush's year in charge of the cia , the u .
s .
national security apparatus actively supported operation condor operations and right-wing military dictatorships in latin america .
in *num* , the cia headquarters in langley , virginia , was named " george bush center for intelligence " in his honor .
after democrat jimmy carter took power in *num* , bush became chairman on the executive committee of the first international bank in houston .
he later spent a year as a part-time professor of administrative science at rice university's jones school of business beginning in *num* , the year it opened ; bush said of his time there , " i loved my brief time in the world of academia .
" between *num* and *num* , he was a director of the council on foreign relations foreign policy organization .
bush decided in the late 1970s that he was going to run for president in *num* ; in *num* , he attended *num* political events ( " cattle calls " ) and traveled more than to campaign for the nation's highest office .
in the contest for the republican party nomination , bush stressed his wide range of government experience , while competing against rivals senator howard baker of tennessee , senator bob dole of kansas , congressman john anderson of illinois ( who would later run as an independent ) , congressman phil crane , also of illinois , former governor john connally of texas , former minnesota governor harold stassen , and the front-runner ronald reagan , a noted former actor and the former governor of california .
at the outset of the *num* primary race , bush focused heavily on winning the january *num* iowa caucuses , including *num* visits to the state ; five months earlier he had won the iowa straw poll .
reagan , however , far ahead in the polls , campaigned little .
bush represented the centrist wing in the gop , whereas reagan represented conservatives .
bush famously labeled reagan's supply side-influenced plans for massive tax cuts " voodoo economics " .
his strategy proved useful , to some degree , as he won in iowa with *num* .
*num* % to reagan's *num* .
*num* % .
after the win , bush stated that his campaign was full of momentum , or " the big mo " .
as a result of the loss , reagan replaced his campaign manager , reorganized his staff , and concentrated on the new hampshire primary .
the two men agreed to a debate in the state , organized by " the nashua telegraph " , but paid for by the reagan campaign .
reagan invited the other four candidates as well , but bush refused to debate them , and eventually they left .
the debate proved to be a pivotal moment in the campaign ; when the moderator , john breen , ordered reagan's microphone turned off , his angry response , " i am paying for this microphone , " struck a chord with the public .
bush ended up losing new hampshire's primary with *num* % to reagan's *num* % .
bush lost most of the remaining primaries as well , and formally dropped out of the race in may of that year .
with his political future in doubt , bush sold his house in houston and bought his grandfather's estate in kennebunkport , maine , known as " walker's point " .
at the republican convention , reagan made the last-minute decision to select bush as his vice presidential nominee , placing him on the winning republican presidential ticket of *num* .
as vice president , bush generally maintained a low profile , recognizing the constitutional limits of the office ; he avoided decision-making or criticizing reagan in any way .
as had become customary , he and his wife moved into the vice president's residence at number one observatory circle , about two miles from the white house .
after selling their house in tanglewood , the bushes declared a room in the houstonian hotel in houston as their official voting address .
the bushes attended a large number of public and ceremonial events in their positions , including many state funerals , which became a common joke for comedians .
mrs .
bush found the funerals largely beneficial , saying , " george met with many current or future heads of state at the funerals he attended , enabling him to forge personal relationships that were important to president reagan .
" as the president of the senate , bush stayed in contact with members of congress and kept the president informed on occurrences on capitol hill .
on march *num* , *num* ( early into the administration ) , reagan was shot and seriously wounded by john hinckley jr .
in washington , d .
c .
bush was in fort worth , texas , and immediately flew back to washington d .
c .
because he was next in line to the presidency .
reagan's cabinet convened in the white house situation room , where they discussed various issues , including the availability of the " nuclear football " .
when bush's plane landed , he was advised by his aides to proceed directly to the white house by helicopter as an image of the government still functioning despite the attack .
bush rejected the idea , responding , " only the president lands on the south lawn .
" this made a positive impression on reagan , who recovered and returned to work within two weeks .
from then on , the two men would have regular thursday lunches in the oval office .
in november *num* , bush toured africa , the first instance of a high united states government official visiting the continent since the reagan administration began .
bush told reporters that while he would allow for heads of state to dictate how each meeting would transpire , there was an expectation on his part for discussions on the independence of namibia , adding that the united states was going to retain the position of no settlement in namibia until cuban troops in angola were withdrawn .
on november *num* , bush met with united states secretary of state george p .
shultz and yuri andropov in moscow , russia , to discuss human rights and arms reductions .
bush later said , " the meeting was frank , cordial and substantive .
it gave both sides the opportunity to exchange views on the state of their relations .
" at the end of january *num* , bush began a seven-day tour of western europe intended to promote the arms reduction commitment being advocated for by the reagan administration .
during a february *num* news conference in paris , bush said the united states ' invitations for the soviet union to consent to a reduction in medium-range missiles were supported by western europe , which he stated had also consented to the deployment of new american missiles starting in the latter part of the year .
the following day , bush defended american nuclear arms policy when answering british secretary general of the committee on nuclear disarmament bruce kent .
in september *num* , bush met with president of romania nicolae ceaușescu , insisting during the meeting that president reagan intended to push for arms reductions at the geneva talks with the soviet union .
shortly thereafter , bush said the united states wanted better relations with all countries within the eastern bloc , though he stressed that nato would retaliate in the event of any threatening of european military stability by the soviets , and he assailed the soviet union for the berlin wall and destroying the korean air lines jetliner .
in december *num* bush flew to el salvador and warned that country's military leaders to end their death squads and hold fully free elections or face the loss of u .
s .
aid .
" it is not just the president , it is not just me or the congress .
if these death-squad murders continue , you will lose the support of the american people and that would indeed be a tragedy .
" bush's aides feared for his safety and thought about calling the meeting off when they discovered apparent blood stains on the floor of the presidential palace of álvaro magaña .
bush was never told of the aides ' concerns and a tense meeting was held in which some of magaña's personnel brandished semiautomatic weapons and refused requests to take them outside .
on june *num* , *num* , bush cast a tie-breaking vote in the senate in favor of the 10-warhead mx missile system .
bush was assigned by reagan to chair two special task forces , on deregulation and international drug smuggling .
the deregulation task force reviewed hundreds of rules , making specific recommendations on which ones to amend or revise , in order to curb the size of the federal government .
the drug smuggling task force coordinated federal efforts to reduce the quantity of drugs entering the united states .
both were popular issues with conservatives , and bush , largely a moderate , began courting them through his work .
according to journalist seymour hersh , bush set up a covert military team which bypassed the cia and congressional oversight .
the team was led by vice-admiral arthur s .
moreau jr .
and carried out operations against terrorists , drug traffickers and soviet spies .
reagan and bush ran for reelection in *num* .
their democratic opponent , walter mondale , made history by choosing a woman , new york representative geraldine ferraro , as his running mate .
she and bush squared off in a single televised vice presidential debate .
ferraro represented a blue-collar district in queens , new york , serving as a contrast to the ivy-league educated bush .
this distinction and her popularity among female journalists left bush at a disadvantage .
regardless , the reagan-bush ticket won in a landslide against the mondale-ferraro ticket .
early into his second term as vice president , bush and his aides were planning a run for the presidency in *num* .
by the end of *num* , a committee had been established , and over two million dollars were raised for bush .
on july *num* , *num* , bush became the first vice president to serve as acting president when reagan underwent surgery to remove polyps from his colon ; bush served as the acting president for approximately eight hours .
in *num* , the reagan administration was shaken by a scandal when it was revealed that administration officials had secretly arranged weapon sales to iran during the iran–iraq war .
the officials had used the proceeds to fund the anti-communist contras in nicaragua , which was a direct violation of law .
the scandal became known as the iran–contra affair .
when news of the public embarrassment broke to the media , bush , like reagan , stated that he had been " out of the loop " and unaware of the diversion of funds , although this was later questioned .
bush began keeping a diary in late *num* , when the scandal was being investigated , and wrote several fake entries .
however , his diaries also stated " i'm one of the few people that know fully the details " and as a result of six pardons by bush , the independent counsel's final report on the iran–contra affair pointedly noted : " the criminal investigation of bush was regrettably incomplete .
" in the " nicaragua v .
united states " case , the international court of justice ( icj ) ruled that the u .
s .
had violated international law by supporting the contras in their rebellion against the nicaraguan government .
in march *num* , bush outlined the government's policy on the combating of terrorism .
in an interagency task force report presented to president reagan , bush publicly stated that the strategy of the federal government was to retaliate without " wantonly " terminating human lives .
in may *num* , bush underwent a procedure to remove a malignant growth from his left cheek .
his spokesman , marlin fitzwater , said that doctors had found the growth weeks earlier .
in september *num* , bush embarked on a month long trip to poland and european allied countries .
on september *num* , bush cast a tie breaking vote in the senate to save the strategic defense initiative from receiving an *num* million cut in funding .
on september *num* , bush delivered a televised address pledging that the us would forever be aligned with poland .
on july *num* , *num* , the guided missile cruiser accidentally shot down iran air flight *num* , killing *num* passengers .
bush said that he would " never apologize for the united states of america .
ever .
i don't care what the facts are .
" as early as *num* , bush had been planning a presidential run ; he entered the republican primaries for president of the united states in october *num* .
his challengers for the republican presidential nomination included u .
s .
senator bob dole of kansas , u .
s .
representative jack kemp of new york , former governor pete du pont of delaware , and conservative christian televangelist pat robertson .
bush was considered the early frontrunner for the nomination , but he came in third in the iowa caucus , behind winner dole and runner-up robertson .
much as reagan had done in *num* , bush reorganized his staff and concentrated on the new hampshire primary .
with dole ahead in new hampshire , bush ran television commercials portraying the senator as a tax raiser and rebounded to win the state's primary .
following the primary , bush and dole had a joint media appearance ; when the interviewer asked dole if he had anything to say to bush , dole said , in response to the ads , " yeah , stop lying about my record ! " in an angry tone .
this is thought to have hurt dole's campaign to bush's benefit .
bush continued seeing victory , winning many southern primaries as well .
once the multiple-state primaries such as super tuesday began , bush's organizational strength and fundraising lead were impossible for the other candidates to match , and the nomination was his .
as the *num* republican national convention approached , there was much speculation over whom bush would choose as his running mate .
he selected little-known u .
s .
senator dan quayle of indiana , who was favored by conservatives .
despite reagan's popularity , bush trailed democratic nominee michael dukakis , then governor of massachusetts , in most polls .
bush was occasionally criticized for his lack of eloquence when compared to reagan , but he delivered a well-received speech at the *num* republican national convention .
known as the " thousand points of light " speech , the presentation described bush's vision of america .
he endorsed the pledge of allegiance , capital punishment , and gun rights , and drew upon his long-standing christian beliefs to support both prayer in schools and oppose abortion .
the speech at the convention included bush's famous pledge : " .
" the general election campaign between bush and dukakis was described in *num* as one of the dirtiest in modern times .
bush pinned blame on dukakis for the pollution of boston harbor , as the governor of massachusetts .
bush also pointed out that dukakis was opposed to a law that would require all students to say the pledge of allegiance , a topic highlighted in bush's nomination acceptance speech .
dukakis ' unconditional opposition to capital punishment led to a pointed question during the presidential debates : moderator bernard shaw asked dukakis hypothetically if he would support the death penalty if his wife , kitty , were raped and murdered .
dukakis's response of " no " played into bush's characterization of dukakis as " soft on crime " , a theme the bush campaign exploited with a provocative , racially-charged television commercial about convicted felon willie horton .
bush defeated dukakis and his running mate , lloyd bentsen , in the electoral college , by *num* to *num* , with bentsen receiving one vote from a faithless elector .
in the nationwide popular vote , bush took *num* .
*num* % of the ballots cast while dukakis received *num* .
*num* % .
bush became the first serving vice president to be elected president since martin van buren in *num* , as well as the first person to succeed someone from his own party to the presidency via election to the office in his own right since herbert hoover in *num* .
bush was inaugurated on january *num* , *num* , succeeding ronald reagan .
he entered office at a period of change in the world ; the fall of the berlin wall came early in his presidency , and the collapse of the soviet union came in *num* .
he ordered military operations in panama and the persian gulf , and , at one point , was recorded as having a record-high approval rating of *num* % .
in his inaugural address , bush said : early in his term , bush faced the problem of what to do with leftover deficits spawned during the reagan years .
at $220 billion in *num* , the deficit had tripled since *num* .
bush was dedicated to curbing the deficit , believing that america could not continue to be a leader in the world without doing so .
he began an effort to persuade the democratic controlled congress to act on the budget ; with republicans believing that the best way was to cut government spending , and democrats convinced that the only way would be to raise taxes , bush faced problems when it came to consensus building .
in the wake of a struggle with congress , bush was forced by the democratic majority to raise tax revenues ; as a result , many republicans felt betrayed because bush had promised " no new taxes " in his *num* campaign .
perceiving a means of revenge , republican congressmen defeated bush's proposal , which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $500 billion over five years .
scrambling , bush accepted the democrats ' demands for higher taxes and more spending , which alienated him from republicans and gave way to a sharp decrease in popularity .
bush later said that he wished that he had never signed the bill .
near the end of the *ord* congress , the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers .
although he originally demanded a reduction in the capital gains tax , bush relented on this issue as well .
this agreement with the democratic leadership in congress proved to be a turning point in the bush presidency ; his popularity among republicans never fully recovered .
coming at around the same time as the budget deal , america entered into a mild recession , which lasted for six months .
many government programs , such as welfare , increased .
as the unemployment rate edged upward in *num* , bush signed a bill providing additional benefits for unemployed workers .
the year *num* was marked by many corporate reorganizations , which laid off a substantial number of workers .
many now unemployed were republicans and independents , who had believed that their jobs were secure .
by his second year in office , bush was told by his economic advisors to stop dealing with the economy , as they believed that he had done everything necessary to ensure his reelection .
by *num* , interest and inflation rates were the lowest in years , but by midyear the unemployment rate reached *num* .
*num* % , the highest since *num* .
in september *num* , the census bureau reported that *num* .
*num* % of all americans lived in poverty .
at a press conference in *num* , bush told reporters that he found foreign policy more enjoyable .
on april *num* , *num* , bush submitted to congress the educational excellence act of *num* , a seven-program education legislative proposal with the intent of achieving " a better-educated america .
" the proposal was opposed by republicans seeking to shrink government's role in education and met with a lack of enthusiasm by democrats .
a week after submitting the proposal , bush said his administration was seeking to provide waivers on " some regulations for poorer communities " and create " a kind of performance-driven partial deregulation of education " that would grant federal funding when schools showed high levels of accountability coupled with academic performance .

bush publicly resigned his life membership in the organization after receiving a form letter from the nra depicting agents of the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , and firearms as " jack-booted thugs .
" he called the nra letter a " vicious slander on good people .
" president bush devoted attention to voluntary service as a means of solving some of america's most serious social problems .
he often used the " thousand points of light " theme to describe the power of citizens to solve community problems .
in his *num* inaugural address , president bush said , " i have spoken of a thousand points of light , of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the nation , doing good .
" four years later , in his report to the nation on the points of light movement , president bush said , " points of light are the soul of america .
they are ordinary people who reach beyond themselves to touch the lives of those in need , bringing hope and opportunity , care and friendship .
by giving so generously of themselves , these remarkable individuals show us not only what is best in our heritage but what all of us are called to become .
" in *num* , the points of light foundation was created as a nonprofit organization in washington d .
c .
to promote this spirit of volunteerism .
in *num* , the points of light foundation merged with the hands on network with the goal of strengthening volunteerism , streamlining costs and services and deepening impact .

bush to highlight the role volunteer service plays in people's lives .
president bush created the daily point of light award in *num* to recognize ordinary americans from all walks of life taking direct and consequential voluntary action in their communities to solve serious social problems .
the president focused great attention on these individuals and organizations , both to honor them for their tremendous work and to call the nation to join them and multiply their efforts .
by the end of his administration , president bush had recognized *num* , *num* daily points of light representing all *num* states and addressing issues ranging from care for infants and teenagers with aids to adult illiteracy and from gang violence to job training for the homeless .
the daily point of light continues to be awarded by points of light and up until his death president bush continued to sign all of the awards .
on july *num* , *num* , president barack obama welcomed president bush to the white house to celebrate the *num* , *ord* daily point of light award .
they bestowed the award on floyd hammer and kathy hamilton of union , iowa , for their work founding outreach , a nonprofit which delivers free meals to hungry children in *num* countries .
bush made two appointments to the supreme court of the united states — david souter in *num* , and clarence thomas in *num* .
additionally , he appointed *num* judges to the united states courts of appeals and *num* judges to the united states district courts .
among these was vaughn walker , a gay man who ruled that california's proposition *num* amendment was unconstitutional .
bush also experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies , as *num* nominees for *num* federal appellate judgeships were not processed by the democratically-controlled senate judiciary committee .
in the 1980s , panamanian leader manuel noriega , a once u .
s .
-supportive leader who was later accused of spying for fidel castro and using panama to traffic drugs into the united states , was one of the most recognizable names in america and was constantly in the press .
the struggle to remove him from power began in the reagan administration , when economic sanctions were imposed on the country ; this included prohibiting american companies and government from making payments to panama and freezing $56 million in panamanian funds in american banks .
reagan sent more than *num* , *num* american troops to panama as well .
unlike reagan , bush was able to remove noriega from power , but his administration's unsuccessful post-invasion planning hindered the needs of panama during the establishment of the young democratic government .
in may *num* , panama held democratic elections , in which guillermo endara was elected president ; the results were then annulled by noriega's government .
in response , bush sent *num* , *num* more troops to the country , where they began conducting regular military exercises in panamanian territory ( in violation of prior treaties ) .
bush shuttered the u .
s .
embassy and removed the u .
s .
ambassador from the country , and dispatched additional troops to panama to prepare the way for an upcoming invasion .
noriega suppressed an october military coup attempt and massive protests in panama against him , but after a u .
s .
serviceman was shot by panamanian forces in december *num* , bush ordered *num* , *num* troops into the central american nation with an objective of removing noriega from power ; " operation just cause " was a large-scale american military operation , and the first in more than *num* years that was not related to the cold war .
the mission was controversial , but american forces achieved control of the country and endara assumed the presidency .
noriega surrendered to the united states and was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in april *num* .
president bush and first lady barbara bush visited panama in june *num* , to give support to the first post-invasion panamanian government .
the visit was marred by protests which broke into gunfire and tear gas , forcing bush to depart a rally .
bush met with soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev at the malta summit in december *num* , just after the fall of the berlin wall .
his administration had been under intense pressure to meet with the soviets , but not all initially found the conference to be a step in the right direction .
general brent scowcroft , among others , was apprehensive about the meeting , saying that it might be " premature " due to concerns that , according to condoleezza rice , " expectations [ would be ] set that something was going to happen , where the soviets might grandstand and force [ the u .
s .
] into agreements that would ultimately not be good for the united states .
" european leaders , including françois mitterrand and margaret thatcher , encouraged bush to meet with gorbachev .
although no agreements were signed , the meeting was received as an important step to the end of the cold war .
when asked about nuclear war , gorbachev responded , " i assured the president of the united states that the soviet union would never start a hot war against the united states of america , and we would like our relations to develop in such a way that they would open greater possibilities for cooperation .
.
.
this is just the beginning .
we are just at the very beginning of our road , long road to a long-lasting , peaceful period .
" another summit was held in july *num* , where the strategic arms reduction treaty ( start i ) was signed by bush and gorbachev in moscow .
the treaty took nine years to negotiate , and was the first major arms agreement since the signing of the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty by reagan and gorbachev in *num* .
the contentions in start would reduce the strategic nuclear weapons of the united states and the ussr by about *num* % over seven years , and the soviet union's land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles would be cut by *num* % .
bush described start as " a significant step forward in dispelling half a century of mistrust " .
bush and condoleezza rice were criticized for their very weak tone and miscalculation in the chicken kiev speech on august *num* , *num* , three weeks before the declaration of independence of ukraine , four months before the *num* .
*num* % -confirmed ukrainian independence referendum , and *num* days before the dissolution of the soviet union .
after the dissolution of the ussr , president bush and russian president boris yeltsin declared a u .
s .
–russian strategic partnership , marking the end of the cold war .
on august *num* , *num* , iraq , led by saddam hussein , invaded its oil-rich neighbor to the south , kuwait ; bush condemned the invasion and began rallying opposition to iraq in the united states and among european , asian , and middle eastern allies .
secretary of defense dick cheney traveled to saudi arabia to meet with king fahd , who requested united states military aid in the matter , fearing a possible invasion of his country as well .
the request was met initially with air force fighter jets .
iraq made attempts to negotiate a deal that would have allowed the country to take control of half of kuwait .
bush rejected this proposal and insisted on a complete withdrawal of iraqi forces .
the planning of a ground operation by u .
s .
-led coalition forces began forming in september *num* , headed by general norman schwarzkopf , jr .
.
bush spoke before a joint session of the united states congress regarding the authorization of air and land attacks , laying out four immediate objectives : " iraq must withdraw from kuwait completely , immediately , and without condition .
kuwait's legitimate government must be restored .
the security and stability of the persian gulf must be assured .
and american citizens abroad must be protected .
" he then outlined a fifth , long-term objective : " out of these troubled times , our fifth objective — a new world order — can emerge : a new era — freer from the threat of terror , stronger in the pursuit of justice , and more secure in the quest for peace .
an era in which the nations of the world , east and west , north and south , can prosper and live in harmony .
.
.
a world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle .
a world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice .
a world where the strong respect the rights of the weak .
" with the united nations security council opposed to iraq's violence , congress authorized the use of military force with a set goal of returning control of kuwait to the kuwaiti government , and protecting america's interests abroad .
early on the morning of january *num* , *num* , allied forces launched the first attack , which included more than *num* , *num* bombing runs by coalition aircraft .
this pace would continue for the next four weeks , until a ground invasion was launched on february *num* , *num* .
allied forces penetrated iraqi lines and pushed toward kuwait city , while on the west side of the country , forces were intercepting the retreating iraqi army .
bush made the decision to stop the offensive after a mere *num* hours .
critics labeled this decision premature , as hundreds of iraqi forces were able to escape ; bush responded by saying that he wanted to minimize u .
s .
casualties .
opponents further charged that bush should have continued the attack , pushing hussein's army back to baghdad , then removing him from power .
bush explained that he did not give the order to overthrow the iraqi government because it would have " incurred incalculable human and political costs .
.
.
we would have been forced to occupy baghdad and , in effect , rule iraq .
" bush's approval ratings skyrocketed after the successful offensive .
additionally , president bush and secretary of state baker felt the coalition victory had increased u .
s .
prestige abroad and believed there was a window of opportunity to use the political capital generated by the coalition victory to revitalize the arab-israeli peace process .
the administration immediately returned to arab-israeli peacemaking following the end of the gulf war ; this resulted in the madrid conference , later in *num* .
several iraqi families living in belgium who lost loved ones in the gulf war launched a lawsuit against george h .
w .
bush for committing what they claim are war crimes in the *num* amiriyah shelter bombing in baghdad , which killed more than *num* civilians .
the suit was brought under belgium's universal jurisdiction guarantees in march *num* .
according to the human rights watch , the amiriyah shelter bombing was " a serious violation of the laws of war .
" faced with a humanitarian disaster in somalia which was exacerbated by a complete breakdown in civil order , the united nations had created the unosom i mission in april *num* to aid the situation through humanitarian efforts , though the mission failed .
the bush administration proposed american aid to the region by assisting in creating a secure environment for humanitarian efforts and un security council resolution *num* was unanimously adopted by the security council on december *num* , *num* .
a lame duck president , bush launched operation restore hope the following day under which the united states would assume command in accordance with resolution *num* .
fighting would escalate and continue into the clinton administration .
during an april *num* , *num* appearance in the press room of the white house , bush announced that the u .
s .
would continue a deal with japan to produce the fsx advanced fighter jet .
he said that promises had been made that american jobs and technology would be safe and the proposal would bolster security for both the u .
s .
and japan .
on march *num* , *num* , bush met for an hour with former prime minister of japan noboru takeshita to discuss shared economic issues and " the fact that their solution will require extraordinary efforts on both sides of the pacific .
" on december *num* , *num* , japanese prime minister kiichi miyazawa apologized to the united states for the attack on pearl harbor .
the following day — the fiftieth anniversary of the attack — bush accepted japan's apology for the event that drew the united states into world war ii .
bush urged that progress be made in improving relations between the u .
s .
and japan .
on june *num* , *num* , white house press secretary marlin fitzwater confirmed president bush had sent prime minister of israel yitzhak shamir a letter in which he congratulated the latter on his election and urged him to support the proposed " shamir initiative for peace , " which would involve the participation of palestinian arabs in local elections .
on june *num* , bush suspended american dialogue with the palestine liberation organization for the latter's refusal to condemn the palestinian guerrilla raid of an israeli beach the previous month .
iraq attacked israel with scud missiles during the gulf war .
most israelis wanted the israeli military to retaliate , but president bush advised the israelis not to .
bush praised prime minister shamir for his leadership during the crisis .
on august *num* , *num* , following a meeting between president bush and prime minister yitzhak rabin , bush announced he would seek the approval of congress to bestow israel with up to $10billion in loan guarantees to assist the country with its absorbing of soviet union immigrants .
the bush administration and the progressive conservative prime minister of canada brian mulroney spearheaded the negotiations of the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) .
the agreement would eliminate the majority of tariffs on products that were traded among the united states , canada , and mexico .
this would encourage trade among the countries .
the treaty also restricted patents , copyrights , and trademarks , and outlined the removal of investment restrictions among the three countries .
president bush announced the completion of nafta during a white house rose garden appearance on august *num* , *num* , calling it the " beginning of a new era " .
the agreement came under heavy scrutiny amongst mainly democrats , who charged that nafta resulted in a loss of american jobs .
nafta also contained no provisions for labor rights ; according to the bush administration , the trade agreement would generate economic resources necessary to enable mexico's government to overcome problems of funding and enforcement of its labor laws .
bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the nafta trade talks .
such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to congress for a vote , thereby avoiding a situation in which the president would be required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that congress wished to change .
while initial signing was possible during his term , negotiations made slow , but steady , progress .
president clinton would go on to make the passage of nafta a priority for his administration , despite its conservative and republican roots—with the addition of two side agreements—to achieve its passage in *num* .
the treaty has since been defended , as well as criticized further .
the american economy has grown *num* % since the adoption of nafta in *num* , with *num* million new jobs created ; this was seen by some as evidence of nafta being beneficial to the united states .
with talk in early *num* regarding a possible american withdrawal from the treaty , carlos m .
gutierrez , the then united states secretary of commerce , wrote , " quitting nafta would send economic shock waves throughout the world , and the damage would start here at home .
" but john j .
sweeney , the then president of the afl-cio , wrote in " the boston globe " that " the u .
s .
trade deficit with canada and mexico ballooned to twelve times its pre-nafta size , reaching $111 billion in *num* .
" in keeping with tradition , bush issued a series of pardons during his last days in office .
on december *num* , *num* , he granted executive clemency to six former senior government officials implicated in the iran-contra scandal of the late 1980s , most prominently the former secretary of defense caspar weinberger .
bush described weinberger , who was scheduled to stand trial starting on january *num* , *num* , for criminal charges related to iran-contra , as a " true american patriot " .
in addition to weinberger , bush pardoned duane r .
clarridge , clair e .
george , who had been convicted to felonies in connection with the iran-contra scandal , robert c .
mcfarlane , elliott abrams , and alan fiers , all of whom had been indicted and / or convicted of criminal charges by an independent counsel headed by lawrence walsh , who headed the investigation of reagan administration officials ' criminal conduct in the iran-contra scandal .
in response to these bush pardons , lawrence walsh stated that " the iran-contra cover-up , which has continued for more than six years , has now been completed .
" walsh noted that in issuing the pardons bush may have been preempting being implicated himself in the crimes of iran-contra by evidence that was to come to light during the weinberger trial , and noted that there was a pattern of " deception and obstruction " by bush , weinberger and other senior reagan administration officials .
george h .
w .
bush received honorary degrees from several american and international universities , including : in *num* , " time " magazine named him the man of the year .
in *num* , the u .
s .
navy memorial foundation awarded bush its lone sailor award for his naval service and his subsequent government service .
in *num* , he was made an honorary knight grand cross of the order of the bath by queen elizabeth ii .
in *num* , he received the pga tour lifetime achievement award and was inducted into the world golf hall of fame two years later .
in early *num* , bush announced that he would seek a second term .
a coalition victory in the persian gulf war and high approval ratings made re-election seem likely .
as a result , many leading democrats declined to seek their party's presidential nomination .
on the negative side , bush's popularity was reduced by an economic recession and doubts of whether he properly ended the gulf war .
conservative political columnist pat buchanan challenged bush for the republican nomination .
he shocked political pundits by finishing second , with *num* % of the vote in the new hampshire primary .
bush responded by adopting more conservative positions on issues , in an attempt to undermine buchanan's base .
once he had secured the nomination , bush faced the democratic nominee , arkansas governor bill clinton .
clinton attacked bush as a politician who was not doing enough to assist the working middle-class and being " out of touch " with the common man , a notion reinforced by reporter andrew rosenthal's false report that bush was " astonished " to see a demonstration of a supermarket scanner .
in early *num* , the race took an unexpected twist when texas billionaire h .
ross perot launched a third party bid , claiming that neither republicans nor democrats could eliminate the deficit and make government more efficient .
his message appealed to voters across the political spectrum disappointed with both parties ' perceived fiscal irresponsibility .
perot later bowed out of the race for a short time , then reentered .
clinton had originally been in the lead , until perot reentered , tightening the race significantly .
as election day neared , the polls suggested that the race was a dead-heat , but clinton pulled out on top , with *num* electoral votes to bush's *num* votes .
perot won *num* % of the popular vote , one of the highest totals for a third party candidate in u .
s .
history , drawing equally from both major candidates , according to exit polls .
several key factors led to bush's defeat .
the ailing economy that arose from recession may have been the main factor in bush's loss .
on election day , *num* in *num* voters said that the economy was either " not so good " or " poor " .
on the eve of the *num* election unemployment reports of *num* .
*num* % ( the highest since *num* ) , and the economic recession overall contributed significantly to a sharp decline in bush's approval rating – to just *num* % .
conservative republicans pointed out that bush's *num* agreement to raise taxes contradicted his famous " " pledge .
in doing so , bush alienated many members of his conservative base , losing their support for his re-election .
according to one survey , of the voters who cited bush's broken " no new taxes " pledge as " very important " , two thirds voted for bill clinton .
bush had raised taxes in an attempt to address an increasing budget deficit , which has largely been attributed to the reagan tax cuts and military spending of the 1980s .
the tax revenue increase had not hurt his approval rating to the extent that it prevented it from reaching its highest level , *num* % , by february *num* , during the gulf war , and four months after the tax vote .
bush was widely seen as a " pragmatic caretaker " president who lacked a unified and compelling long-term theme in his efforts .
indeed , bush's sound bite where he refers to the issue of overarching purpose as " the vision thing " has become a metonym applied to other political figures accused of similar difficulties .
" he does not say why he wants to be there " , wrote columnist george will , " so the public does not know why it should care if he gets his way " .
his ivy league and prep school education led to warnings by advisors that his image was too " preppy " in *num* , which resulted in deliberate efforts in his *num* campaign to shed the image , including meeting voters at factories and shopping malls , abandoning set speeches .
bush's campaign director roger ailes and others were concerned that bush was seen as a " wimp .
" bush put that image to rest when he displayed evident fury during an interview with dan rather on january *num* , *num* .
his ability to gain broad international support for the gulf war and the war's result were seen as both a diplomatic and military triumph , rousing bipartisan approval , though his decision to withdraw without removing saddam hussein left mixed feelings , and attention returned to the domestic front and a souring economy .
a " new york times " article mistakenly depicted bush as being surprised to see a supermarket barcode reader ; the report of his reaction exacerbated the notion that he was " out of touch " .
amid the early 1990s recession , his image shifted from " conquering hero " to " politician befuddled by economic matters " .
although bush became the first elected republican president since hoover in *num* to lose a reelection bid ( facing a *num* % approval rating leading up to the *num* election ) , the mood did not last .
despite his defeat , bush climbed back from election day approval levels to leave office in *num* with a *num* % job approval rating .
by december *num* , *num* % of americans gave bush's presidency a positive rating .
upon leaving office , bush retired with his wife , barbara , and temporarily moved into a friend's house near the tanglewood community of houston as they prepared to build a permanent retirement house nearby .
ultimately they built their retirement house in the community of west oaks , near tanglewood .
they had a presidential office within the park laureate building on memorial drive .
mimi swartz of " national geographic " wrote that " the bushes are too studiously sedate to live in river oaks " .
they spent their summers at walker's point in kennebunkport , maine .
in *num* , bush was targeted in an assassination plot when he visited kuwait to commemorate the coalition's victory over iraq in the gulf war .
kuwaiti authorities arrested *num* people who were allegedly involved in using a car bomb in an attempt to kill bush .
through interviews with the suspects and examinations of the bomb's circuitry and wiring , the fbi established that the plot had been directed by the iraqi intelligence service .
a kuwaiti court later convicted all but one of the defendants .
two months later , clinton retaliated when he ordered the firing of *num* cruise missiles at iraqi intelligence service headquarters in baghdad .
the day before the strike , u .
s .
ambassador to the united nations madeleine albright went before the security council to present evidence of the iraqi plot .
after the missiles were fired , vice president al gore said the attack " was intended to be a proportionate response at the place where this plot " to assassinate bush " was hatched and implemented " .

proud father , is the way i would sum it all up .

the arabs would never have talked to us .

w .
bush " and " george bush senior " and colloquialisms such as " bush *num* " and " bush the elder " much more common .

w .
bush was traveling to minnesota for a speaking engagement on the day of the september *num* attacks .

ansary prize .
the kennedy foundation award was presented by jack schlossberg , the late president's grandson , to lauren bush lauren , who accepted on her grandfather's behalf .
the ansary prize was presented in houston with ansary , barbara lucas , ryan c .
crocker , dean of the bush school since january *num* , barbara bush , and curt viebranz in attendance with the former president .
bush directed $50 , *num* of the prize to the bush school of government and public service at texas a&m university , and $25 , *num* to fund an animation about the siege of yorktown for mount vernon .
viebranz and lucas represented mount vernon at the presentation .
on june *num* , *num* , bush fulfilled a long-standing promise by skydiving on his *ord* birthday .
he made the parachute jump from a helicopter near his home at *num* : *num* a .
m .
in kennebunkport , maine .
the jump marked the eighth time the past president skydived , including jumps on his *ord* and *ord* birthday as well .
he tweeted about the incident prior to the jump , saying " it's a wonderful day in maine — in fact , nice enough for a parachute jump .
" on december *num* , *num* , bush and former senator bob dole commemorated the *ord* anniversary of the attack on pearl harbor by appearing at the bush school of government and public service at texas a&m university .
bush supported his younger son jeb's *num* presidential bid .
jeb bush's campaign struggled however , and he withdrew from the race during the primaries .
neither george h .
w .
nor george w .
bush endorsed the eventual republican nominee , donald trump ; all three bushes emerged as frequent critics of trump's policies and speaking style , while trump frequently criticized george w .
bush's presidency .
george h .
w .
bush later said that he voted for the democratic nominee , hillary clinton , in the general election .
after trump won the election , bush sent him a congratulatory message .
on february *num* , *num* , george and barbara bush participated in the coin toss for super bowl li .

on september *num* , *num* , bush partnered with former presidents carter , clinton , george w .
bush , and obama to work with one america appeal to help the victims of hurricane harvey and hurricane irma in the gulf coast and texas communities .
bush was raised in the episcopal church , though by the end of his life his apparent religious beliefs are considered to have more in line with evangelical christian doctrine and practices .
he cited various moments in his life deepening of his faith , including his escape from japanese forces in *num* , and the death of his three-year-old daughter robin in *num* .
his faith was reflected in his thousand points of light speech , his support for prayer in schools , and his support for the pro-life movement ( following his election as vice president ) .
after his wife's death in april *num* , bush released a statement through his spokesman , saying in part , " we have faith she is in heaven , and we know life will go on — as she would have it .
so , cross the bushes off your worry list .
" on the day of his death , his friend james baker told bush that he was going to heaven .
bush replied " good .
that's where i want to go .
" in *num* , " the new york times " revealed that bush was suffering from graves ' disease , a non-contagious thyroid condition that his wife barbara also suffered from .
on february *num* , *num* , bush was standing at a reception for *num* minutes when he felt lightheaded .
he was admitted to a hospital with an irregular heartbeat .
when bush was released three days later , his doctors said that he had retained the irregularity in his heartbeat .
on march *num* , *num* , bush fainted on a golf course and was admitted to the eisenhower medical center in rancho mirage , california , but was released the following morning .
in july *num* , bush suffered a severe neck injury .
at age *num* in october that year , he was wearing a neck brace in his first public engagement since the accident when he threw the ceremonial first pitch for the houston astros at minute maid park .
bush wrote a letter to president-elect donald trump in january *num* to inform him that because of his poor health , he would not be able to attend trump's inauguration on january *num* ; he gave him his best wishes .
on january *num* , he was admitted to the intensive care unit at houston methodist hospital , where he was sedated for a procedure to treat an acute respiratory problem that was stemming from pneumonia .
three months later , he experienced a recurrence of pneumonia and was hospitalized .
on november *num* , *num* , bush became the longest-lived u .
s .
president when he surpassed the *num* years and *num* days lifespan of gerald ford , who died in december *num* .
upon ford's death bush had become both the nation's oldest living president as well as the oldest living vice president ; on june *num* , *num* he became the first u .
s .
president to reach the age of *num* .
on april *num* , *num* , the day after his wife's funeral bush was hospitalized with a blood infection .
the infection led to sepsis .
one month later , he was briefly hospitalized again , after experiencing fatigue and low blood pressure .
in december *num* , the nonprofit compassion international , revealed that bush secretly sponsored a boy in the philippines for ten years using a pseudonym .
he sponsored the boy from *num* until *num* , personally writing to timothy using the name george walker .
timothy only found out who his sponsor had been after he graduated from the program at *num* .
in october *num* , during the me too movement , actress heather lind accused bush of groping her and telling an inappropriate joke .
several other women subsequently made similar allegations , including christina baker kline and roslyn corrigan ( who was *num* years old at the time of the alleged incident in *num* ) .
bush apologized for these incidents through his spokesman , jim mcgrath .
at the time , an editorial writer for the " washington post " noted that some would relate his behavior to his vascular parkinsonism or other senility related conditions .
bush suffered from vascular parkinsonism , a form of parkinson's disease which had forced him to use a motorized scooter or wheelchair since at least *num* .
george h .
w .
bush died on november *num* , *num* , aged *num* , at his home in houston .
tributes and condolences were offered by former presidents jimmy carter , bill clinton , george w .
bush , barack obama and incumbent president donald trump .
bush laid in state in the rotunda of the u .
s .
capitol from december *num* through december *num* ; he was the *ord* u .
s .
president to be accorded this honor .
then , on december *num* , bush's casket was transferred from the capitol rotunda to washington national cathedral where a state funeral was held .
former president george w .
bush eulogized his father saying , former canadian prime minister brian mulroney ( 1984–1993 ) said , afterward , bush's casket was flown back to houston and then transported to st .
martin's episcopal church where a second service was held on december *num* .
following this his casket was brought by train to the george h .
w .
bush presidential library in college station , texas where he was buried next to his wife barbara and daughter robin .
according to " usa today " , the legacy of bush's presidency was defined by his victory over iraq after the invasion of kuwait , and for his presiding over the collapse of the ussr and unification of germany .
the paper said his political legacy would " continue years later through his son , george w .
bush , who became the *ord* president of the united states .
" matt picht from newsy also stressed bush's accomplishments as a foreign policy president , such as his decision to arrest and depose panamanian dictator manuel noriega - a popular move at the time , but according to picht , one which is now less fondly remembered .
according to presidential historian mark k .
updegrove , bush " cemented " the tradition of presidents leaving behind letters of support for their successors on the resolute desk .
while reagan had been the first modern president to do so in *num* , bush's move was significant in that his gesture of goodwill was made towards clinton , the man to whom bush had just lost the election .
the george bush presidential library is the nation's tenth presidential library and was built between *num* and *num* .
it contains the presidential and vice presidential papers of bush and the vice presidential papers of dan quayle .
it was dedicated on november *num* , *num* , and opened to the public shortly thereafter ; the architectural firm of hellmuth , obata and kassabaum designed the complex .
the george bush presidential library and museum is located on a site on the west campus of texas a&m university in college station , texas , on a plaza adjoining the presidential conference center and the texas a&m academic center .
the library operates under nara's administration and the provisions of the presidential libraries act of *num* .
the bush school of government and public service is a graduate public policy school at texas a&m university in college station , texas , which was established in *num* .
the graduate school is part of the presidential library complex , and offers four programs — two master's degree programs ( public service and administration , and international affairs ) and three certificate programs ( advanced international affairs , nonprofit management , and homeland security ) .
arctic fox the arctic fox preys on many small creatures such as lemmings , voles , ringed seal pups , fish , waterfowl , and seabirds .
it also eats carrion , berries , seaweed , and insects and other small invertebrates .
arctic foxes form monogamous pairs during the breeding season and they stay together to raise their young in complex underground dens .
occasionally , other family members may assist in raising their young .
natural predators of the arctic fox are golden eagles , polar bears , wolverines , red foxes , wolves , and grizzly bears .
arctic foxes must endure a temperature difference of up to 90-100 °c between the external environment and their internal core temperature .
to prevent heat loss , the arctic fox curls up tightly tucking its legs and head under its body and behind its furry tail .
this position gives the fox the smallest surface area to volume ratio and protects the least insulated areas .
arctic foxes also stay warm by getting out of the wind and residing in their dens .
although the arctic fox is active year-round and do not hibernate , they attempt to preserve fat by reducing their locomotor activity .
they build up their fat reserves in the autumn , sometimes increasing their body weight by more than *num* % .
this provides greater insulation during the winter and a source of energy when food is scarce .
in the spring , the arctic fox's attention switches to reproduction and a home for their potential offspring .
they live in large dens in frost-free , slightly raised ground .
these are complex systems of tunnels covering as much as and are often in eskers , long ridges of sedimentary material deposited in formerly glaciated regions .
these dens may be in existence for many decades and are used by many generations of foxes .
arctic foxes tend to select dens that are easily accessible with many entrances , and that are clear from snow and ice making it easier to burrow in .
the arctic fox builds and chooses dens that face southward towards the sun , which makes the den warmer .
arctic foxes prefer large , maze-like dens for predator evasion and a quick escape especially when red foxes are in the area .
natal dens are typically found in rugged terrain , which may provide more protection for the pups .
but , the parents will also relocate litters to nearby dens to avoid predators .
when red foxes are not in the region , arctic foxes will use dens that the red fox previously occupied .
shelter quality is more important to the arctic fox than the proximity of spring prey to a den .
the main prey in the tundra is lemmings , which is why the white fox is often called the “lemming fox .
” the white fox's reproduction rates reflect the lemming population density , which cyclically fluctuates every 3–5 years .
when lemmings are abundant , the white fox can give birth to *num* pups , but they often do not reproduce when food is scarce .
the “coastal fox” or blue fox lives in an environment where food availability is relatively consistent , and they will have up to *num* pups every year .
breeding usually takes place in april and may , and the gestation period is about *num* days .
litters may contain as many as *num* ( the largest litter size in the order carnivora ) .
the young emerge from the den when *num* to *num* weeks old and are weaned by *num* weeks of age .
arctic foxes are primarily monogamous and both parents will care for the offspring .
when predators and prey are abundant , arctic foxes are more likely to be promiscuous ( exhibited in both males and females ) and display more complex social structures .
larger packs of foxes consisting of breeding or non-breeding males or females can guard a single territory more proficiently to increase pup survival .
when resources are scarce , competition increases and the number of foxes in a territory decreases .
on the coasts of svalbard , the frequency of complex social structures is larger than inland foxes that remain monogamous due to food availability .
in scandinavia , there are more complex social structures compared to other populations due to the presence of the red fox .
also , conservationists are supplying the declining population with supplemental food .
one unique case , however , is iceland where monogamy is the most prevalent .
the older offspring ( 1-year-olds ) often remain within their parent's territory even though predators are absent and there are fewer resources , which may indicate kin selection in the fox .
arctic foxes generally eat any small animal they can find , including lemmings , voles , other rodents , hares , birds , eggs , fish , and carrion .
they scavenge on carcasses left by larger predators such as wolves and polar bears , and in times of scarcity even eat their feces .
in areas where they are present , lemmings are their most common prey , and a family of foxes can eat dozens of lemmings each day .
in some locations in northern canada , a high seasonal abundance of migrating birds that breed in the area may provide an important food source .
on the coast of iceland and other islands , their diet consists predominantly of birds .
during april and may , the arctic fox also preys on ringed seal pups when the young animals are confined to a snow den and are relatively helpless .
they also consume berries and seaweed , so they may be considered omnivores .
this fox is a significant bird-egg predator , consuming eggs of all except the largest tundra bird species .
when food is overabundant , the arctic fox buries ( caches ) the surplus as a reserve .
arctic foxes survive harsh winters and food scarcity by either hoarding food or storing body fat .
fat is deposited subcutaneously and viscerally in arctic foxes .
at the beginning of winter , the foxes have approximately *num* kj of energy storage from fat alone .
using the lowest bmr value measured in arctic foxes , an average sized fox ( *num* .
*num* kg ) would need *num* kj / day during the winter to survive .
arctic foxes can acquire goose eggs ( from greater snow geese in canada ) at a rate of *num* .
7–7 .
*num* eggs / h , and they store 80–97 % of them .
scats provide evidence that they eat the eggs during the winter after caching .
isotope analysis shows that eggs can still be eaten after a year , and the metabolizable energy of a stored goose egg only decreases by *num* % after *num* days ( a fresh egg has about *num* kj ) .
researchers have also noted that some eggs stored in the summer are accessed later the following spring prior to reproduction .
the arctic fox lives in some of the most frigid extremes on the planet , but they do not start to shiver until the temperature drops to .
among its adaptations for survival in the cold is its dense , multilayered pelage , which provides excellent insulation .
additionally , the arctic fox is the only canid whose foot pads are covered in fur .
there are two genetically distinct coat color morphs : white and blue .
in the winter the white morph is white in color and turns brown along the back with light grey around the abdomen in summer .
the blue morph is often a dark blue , brown , or grey color year-round .
although the blue allele is dominant over the white allele , *num* % of the arctic fox population is the white morph .
the fur of the arctic fox provides the best insulation of any mammal .
the fox has a low surface area to volume ratio , as evidenced by its generally compact body shape , short muzzle and legs , and short , thick ears .
since less of its surface area is exposed to the arctic cold , less heat escapes from its body .
the arctic fox has a functional hearing range between *num* hz–16 khz with a sensitivity that is ≤ *num* db in air , and an average peak sensitivity of *num* db at *num* khz .
overall , the arctic foxes hearing is less sensitive than the dog and the kit fox .
the arctic fox and the kit fox have a low upper-frequency limit compared to the domestic dog and other carnivores .
the arctic fox can easily hear lemmings burrowing under 4-5 inches of snow .
when it has located its prey , it pounces and punches through the snow to catch its victim .
the arctic fox also has a keen sense of smell .
they can smell carcasses that are often left by polar bears anywhere from 10–40 km .
it is possible that they use their sense of smell to also track down polar bears .
additionally , arctic foxes can smell and find frozen lemmings under 46–77 cm of snow , and can detect a subnivean seal lair under *num* cm of snow .
the arctic fox contains advantageous genes to overcome extreme cold and starvation periods .
transcriptome sequencing has identified two genes that are under positive selection : glycolipid transfer protein domain containing *num* ( gltpd1 ) and v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog *num* ( akt2 ) .
gltpd1 is involved in the fatty acid metabolism , while akt2 pertains to the glucose metabolism and insulin signaling .
the average mass specific bmr and total bmr are *num* % and *num* % lower in the winter than the summer .
the arctic fox decreases its bmr via metabolic depression in the winter to conserve fat storage and minimize energy requirements .
according to the most recent data , the lower critical temperature of the arctic fox is at −7 °c in the winter and *num* °c in the summer .
it was commonly believed that the arctic fox had a lower critical temperature below −40 °c .
however , some scientists have concluded that this stat is not accurate since it was never tested using the proper equipment .
about *num* % of the total body surface area of the arctic fox dissipates heat readily compared to red foxes at *num* % .
the regions that have the greatest heat loss are the nose , ears , legs , and feet , which is useful in the summer for thermal heat regulation .
also , the arctic fox has a beneficial mechanism in their nose for evaporative cooling like dogs , which keeps the brain cool during the summer and exercise .
the thermal conductivity of arctic fox fur in the summer and winter is the same ; however , the thermal conductance of the arctic fox in the winter is lower than the summer since fur thickness increases by *num* % .
in the summer , the thermal conductance of the arctic foxes body is *num* % higher than the winter , but their body core temperature is constant year-round .
one way that arctic foxes regulate their body temperature is by utilizing a countercurrent heat exchange in the blood of their legs .
arctic foxes can constantly keep their feet above the tissue freezing point ( −1 °c ) when standing on cold substrates without losing mobility or feeling pain .
they do this by increasing vasodilation and blood flow to a capillary rete in the pad surface , which is in direct contact with the snow rather than the entire foot .
they selectively vasoconstrict blood vessels in the center of the foot pad , which conserves energy and minimizes heat loss .
arctic foxes maintain the temperature in their paws independently from the core temperature .
if the core temperature drops , the pad of the foot will remain constantly above the tissue freezing point .
the average head-and-body length of the male is , with a range of , while the female averages with a range of .
in some regions , no difference in size is seen between males and females .
the tail is about long in both sexes .
the height at the shoulder is .
on average males weigh , with a range of , while females average , with a range of .
"vulpes lagopus " is a ' true fox ' belonging to the genus " vulpes " of the fox tribe vulpini , which consists of *num* extant species .
it is classified under the subfamily caninae of the canid family canidae .
although it has previously been assigned to its own monotypic genus " alopex " , recent genetic evidence now places it in the genus " vulpes " along with the majority of other foxes .
it was originally described by carl linnaeus in the *ord* edition of " systema naturae " in *num* as " canis lagopus " .
the type specimen was recovered from lapland , sweden .
the generic name " vulpes " is latin for " fox " .
the specific name " lagopus " is derived from ancient greek λαγώς ( " lagōs " , " hare " ) and πούς ( " pous " , " foot " ) , referring to the hair on its feet similar to those found in cold-climate species of hares .
looking at the most recent phylogeny , the arctic fox diverged from the domesticated dog ( " canis lupus familiaris " ) at approximately *num* mya .
the arctic fox and the red fox ( " vulpes vulpes " ) diverged approximately *num* .
17mya .
additionally , the arctic fox diverged from its sister group , the kit fox ( " vulpes macrotis " ) , at about *num* .
9mya .
the origins of the arctic fox have been described by the “out of tibet” hypothesis .
on the tibetan plateau , fossils of the extinct ancestral arctic fox ( " vulpes qiuzhudingi " ) from the early pliocene ( *num* .
08–3 .
*num* mya ) were found along with many other precursors of modern mammals that evolved during the pliocene ( *num* .
3–2 .
*num* mya ) .
it is believed that this ancient fox is the ancestor of the modern arctic fox .
globally , the pliocene was about 2–3 °c warmer than today , and the arctic during the summer in the mid-pliocene was *num* °c warmer .
by using stable carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of fossils , researchers claim that the tibetan plateau experienced tundra-like conditions during the pliocene and harbored cold-adapted mammals that later spread to north america and eurasia during the pleistocene epoch ( *num* .
*num* million-11 , *num* years ago ) .
besides the nominate subspecies , the common arctic fox , " v .
l .
lagopus " , four other subspecies of this fox have been described : the arctic fox has a circumpolar distribution and occurs in arctic tundra habitats in northern europe , northern asia , and north america .
its range includes greenland , iceland , fennoscandia , svalbard , jan mayen ( where it was hunted to extinction ) and other islands in the barents sea , northern russia , islands in the bering sea , alaska , and canada as far south as hudson bay .
in the late *ord* century , it was introduced into the aleutian islands southwest of alaska .
however , the population on the aleutian islands is currently being eradicated in conservation efforts to preserve the local bird population .
it mostly inhabits tundra and pack ice , but is also present in canadian boreal forests ( northeastern alberta , northern saskatchewan , northern manitoba , northern ontario , northern quebec , and newfoundland and labrador ) and the kenai peninsula in alaska .
they are found at elevations up to above sea level and have been seen on sea ice close to the north pole .
the arctic fox is the only land mammal native to iceland .
it came to the isolated north atlantic island at the end of the last ice age , walking over the frozen sea .
the arctic fox center in súðavík contains an exhibition on the arctic fox and conducts studies on the influence of tourism on the population .
its range during the last ice age was much more extensive than it is now , and fossil remains of the arctic fox have been found over much of northern europe and siberia .
the color of the fox's coat also determines where they are most likely to be found .
the white morph mainly lives inland and blends in with the snowy tundra , while the blue morph occupies the coasts because its dark color blends in with the cliffs and rocks .
during the winter , *num* .
*num* % of arctic foxes utilize commuting trips , which remain within the fox's home range .
commuting trips in arctic foxes last less than *num* days and occur between 0–2 .
*num* times a month .
nomadism is found in *num* .
*num* % of the foxes , and loop migrations ( where the fox travels to a new range , then returns to its home range ) are the least common at *num* .
*num* % .
arctic foxes in canada that undergo nomadism and migrations voyage from the canadian archipelago to greenland and northwestern canada .
the duration and distance traveled between males and females is not significantly different .
arctic foxes closer to goose colonies ( located at the coasts ) are less likely to migrate .
meanwhile , foxes experiencing low-density lemming populations are more likely to make sea ice trips .
residency is common in the arctic fox population so that they can maintain their territories .
migratory foxes have a mortality rate times higher than resident foxes .
nomadic behavior becomes more common as the foxes age .
the conservation status of the species is in general good and several hundred thousand individuals are estimated to remain in total .
the iucn has assessed it as being of " least concern " .
however , the scandinavian mainland population is acutely endangered , despite being legally protected from hunting and persecution for several decades .
the estimate of the adult population in all of norway , sweden , and finland is fewer than *num* individuals .
as a result , the populations of arctic fox have been carefully studied and inventoried in places such as the vindelfjällens nature reserve ( sweden ) , which has the arctic fox as its symbol .
the abundance of the arctic fox tends to fluctuate in a cycle along with the population of lemmings and voles ( a 3- to 4-year cycle ) .
the populations are especially vulnerable during the years when the prey population crashes , and uncontrolled trapping has almost eradicated two subpopulations .
the pelts of arctic foxes with a slate-blue coloration were especially valuable .
they were transported to various previously fox-free aleutian islands during the 1920s .
the program was successful in terms of increasing the population of blue foxes , but their predation of aleutian canada geese conflicted with the goal of preserving that species .
the arctic fox is losing ground to the larger red fox .
this has been attributed to climate change—the camouflage value of its lighter coat decreases with less snow cover .
red foxes dominate where their ranges begin to overlap by killing arctic foxes and their kits .
an alternative explanation of the red fox's gains involves the gray wolf .
historically , it has kept red fox numbers down , but as the wolf has been hunted to near extinction in much of its former range , the red fox population has grown larger , and it has taken over the niche of top predator .
in areas of northern europe , programs are in place that allow the hunting of red foxes in the arctic fox's previous range .
as with many other game species , the best sources of historical and large-scale population data are hunting bag records and questionnaires .
several potential sources of error occur in such data collections .
in addition , numbers vary widely between years due to the large population fluctuations .
however , the total population of the arctic fox must be in the order of several hundred thousand animals .
the world population of arctic foxes is thus not endangered , but two arctic fox subpopulations are .
one is on medny island ( commander islands , russia ) , which was reduced by some 85–90 % , to around *num* animals , as a result of mange caused by an ear tick introduced by dogs in the 1970s .
the population is currently under treatment with antiparasitic drugs , but the result is still uncertain .
the other threatened population is the one in fennoscandia ( norway , sweden , finland , and kola peninsula ) .
this population decreased drastically around the start of the *ord* century as a result of extreme fur prices , which caused severe hunting also during population lows .
the population has remained at a low density for more than *num* years , with additional reductions during the last decade .
the total population estimate for *num* is around *num* adults in sweden , *num* adults in finland , and *num* in norway .
from kola , there are indications of a similar situation , suggesting a population of around *num* adults .
the fennoscandian population thus numbers around *num* breeding adults .
even after local lemming peaks , the arctic fox population tends to collapse back to levels dangerously close to nonviability .
the arctic fox is classed as a " prohibited new organism " under new zealand's hazardous substances and new organisms act *num* , preventing it from being imported into the country .
calf a calf ( plural , calves ) is the young of domestic cattle .
calves are reared to become adult cattle , or are slaughtered for their meat , called veal , and for their calfskin .
the term " calf " is also used for some other species .
see " other animals " below .
"calf " is the term used from birth to weaning , when it becomes known as a " weaner " or " weaner calf " , though in some areas the term " calf " may be used until the animal is a yearling .
the birth of a calf is known as " calving " .
a calf that has lost its mother is an orphan calf , also known as a " poddy " or " poddy-calf " in british english .
" bobby calves " are young calves which are to be slaughtered for human consumption .
a " vealer " is a fat calf weighing less than about which is at about eight to nine months of age .
a young female calf from birth until she has had a calf of her own is called a " heifer" ( ) .
in the american old west , a motherless or small , runty calf was sometimes referred to as a " dogie , " ( pronounced with a long " o " ) .
the term " calf " is also used for some other species .
see " other animals " below .
calves may be produced by natural means , or by artificial breeding using artificial insemination or embryo transfer .
calves are born after a gestation of nine months .
they usually stand within a few minutes of calving , and suckle within an hour .
however , for the first few days they are not easily able to keep up with the rest of the herd , so young calves are often left hidden by their mothers , who visit them several times a day to suckle them .
by a week old the calf is able to follow the mother all the time .
some calves are ear tagged soon after birth , especially those that are stud cattle in order to correctly identify their dams ( mothers ) , or in areas ( such as the eu ) where tagging is a legal requirement for cattle .
a calf must have the very best of everything until it is at least eight months old if it is to reach its maximum potential .
typically when the calves are about two months old they are branded , ear marked , castrated and vaccinated .
the " single suckler " system of rearing calves is similar to that occurring naturally in wild cattle , where each calf is suckled by its own mother until it is weaned at about nine months old .
this system is commonly used for rearing beef cattle throughout the world .
cows kept on poor forage ( as is typical in subsistence farming ) produce a limited amount of milk .
a calf left with such a mother all the time can easily drink all the milk , leaving none for human consumption .
for dairy production under such circumstances , the calf's access to the cow must be limited , for example by penning the calf and bringing the mother to it once a day after partly milking her .
the small amount of milk available for the calf under such systems may mean that it takes a longer time to rear , and in subsistence farming it is therefore common for cows to calve only in alternate years .
in more intensive dairy farming , cows can easily be bred and fed to produce far more milk than one calf can drink .
in the " multi-suckler " system , several calves are fostered onto one cow in addition to her own , and these calves ' mothers can then be used wholly for milk production .
more commonly , calves of dairy cows are fed formula milk from a bottle or bucket from soon after birth .
purebred female calves of dairy cows are reared as replacement dairy cows .
most purebred dairy calves are produced by artificial insemination ( ai ) .
by this method each bull can serve very many cows , so only a very few of the purebred dairy male calves are needed to provide bulls for breeding .
the remainder of the male calves may be reared for beef or veal ; however , some extreme dairy breeds carry so little muscle that rearing the purebred male calves may be uneconomic , and in this case they are often killed soon after birth and disposed of .
only a proportion of purebred heifers are needed to provide replacement cows , so often some of the cows in dairy herds are put to a beef bull to produce crossbred calves suitable for rearing as beef .
veal calves may be reared entirely on milk formula and killed at about *num* or *num* weeks as " white " veal , or fed on grain and hay and killed at *num* to *num* weeks to produce red or pink veal .
a commercial steer or bull calf is expected to put on about per month .
a nine-month-old steer or bull is therefore expected to weigh about .
heifers will weigh at least at eight months of age .
calves are usually weaned at about eight to nine months of age , but depending on the season and condition of the dam , they might be weaned earlier .
they may be paddock weaned , often next to their mothers , or weaned in stockyards .
the latter system is preferred by some as it accustoms the weaners to the presence of people and they are trained to take feed other than grass .
small numbers may also be weaned with their dams with the use of weaning nose rings or nosebands which results in the mothers rejecting the calves ' attempts to suckle .
many calves are also weaned when they are taken to the large weaner auction sales that are conducted in the south eastern states of australia .
victoria and new south wales have yardings of up to *num* , *num* weaners ( calves ) for auction sale in one day .
the best of these weaners may go to the butchers .
others will be purchased by re-stockers to grow out and fatten on grass or as potential breeders .
in the united states these weaners may be known as " feeders " and would be placed directly into feedlots .
at about *num* months old a beef heifer reaches puberty if she is well grown .
calves suffer from few congenital abnormalities but the akabane virus is widely distributed in temperate to tropical regions of the world .
the virus is a teratogenic pathogen which causes abortions , stillbirths , premature births and congenital abnormalities , but occurs only during some years .
calf meat for human consumption is called veal , and is usually produced from the male calves of dairy cattle .
also eaten are calf's brains and calf liver .
the hide is used to make calfskin , or tanned into leather and called calf leather , or sometimes in the us " novillo " , the spanish term .
the fourth compartment of the stomach of slaughtered milk-fed calves is the source of rennet .
the intestine is used to make goldbeater's skin , and is the source of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase ( cip ) .
dairy cows can only produce milk after having calved , and dairy cows need to produce one calf each year in order to remain in production .
female calves will become a replacement dairy cow .
male dairy calves are generally reared for beef or veal ; relatively few are kept for breeding purposes .
in english the term " calf " is used by extension for the young of various other large species of mammal .
in addition to other bovid species ( such as bison , yak and water buffalo ) , these include the young of camels , dolphins , elephants , giraffes , hippopotamuses , larger deer ( such as moose , elk ( wapiti ) and red deer ) , rhinoceroses , porpoises , whales , walruses and larger seals .
however , common domestic species tend to have their own specific names , such as foal and lamb .
geotechnical engineering geotechnical engineering is the branch of civil engineering concerned with the engineering behavior of earth materials .
geotechnical engineering is important in civil engineering , but also has applications in military , mining , petroleum and other engineering disciplines that are concerned with construction occurring on the surface or within the ground .
geotechnical engineering uses principles of soil mechanics and rock mechanics to investigate subsurface conditions and materials ; determine the relevant physical / mechanical and chemical properties of these materials ; evaluate stability of natural slopes and man-made soil deposits ; assess risks posed by site conditions ; design earthworks and structure foundations ; and monitor site conditions , earthwork and foundation construction .
a typical geotechnical engineering project begins with a review of project needs to define the required material properties .
then follows a site investigation of soil , rock , fault distribution and bedrock properties on and below an area of interest to determine their engineering properties including how they will interact with , on or in a proposed construction .
site investigations are needed to gain an understanding of the area in or on which the engineering will take place .
investigations can include the assessment of the risk to humans , property and the environment from natural hazards such as earthquakes , landslides , sinkholes , soil liquefaction , debris flows and rockfalls .
a geotechnical engineer then determines and designs the type of foundations , earthworks , and / or pavement subgrades required for the intended man-made structures to be built .
foundations are designed and constructed for structures of various sizes such as high-rise buildings , bridges , medium to large commercial buildings , and smaller structures where the soil conditions do not allow code-based design .
foundations built for above-ground structures include shallow and deep foundations .
retaining structures include earth-filled dams and retaining walls .
earthworks include embankments , tunnels , dikes and levees , channels , reservoirs , deposition of hazardous waste and sanitary landfills .
geotechnical engineering is also related to coastal and ocean engineering .
coastal engineering can involve the design and construction of wharves , marinas , and jetties .
ocean engineering can involve foundation and anchor systems for offshore structures such as oil platforms .
the fields of geotechnical engineering and engineering geology are closely related , and have large areas of overlap .
however , the field of geotechnical engineering is a specialty of engineering , where the field of engineering geology is a specialty of geology .
coming from the fields of engineering and science , respectively , the two may approach the same subject , such as soil classification , with different methods .
humans have historically used soil as a material for flood control , irrigation purposes , burial sites , building foundations , and as construction material for buildings .
first activities were linked to irrigation and flood control , as demonstrated by traces of dykes , dams , and canals dating back to at least *num* bce that were found in ancient egypt , ancient mesopotamia and the fertile crescent , as well as around the early settlements of mohenjo daro and harappa in the indus valley .
as the cities expanded , structures were erected supported by formalized foundations ; ancient greeks notably constructed pad footings and strip-and-raft foundations .
until the *ord* century , however , no theoretical basis for soil design had been developed and the discipline was more of an art than a science , relying on past experience .
several foundation-related engineering problems , such as the leaning tower of pisa , prompted scientists to begin taking a more scientific-based approach to examining the subsurface .
the earliest advances occurred in the development of earth pressure theories for the construction of retaining walls .
henri gautier , a french royal engineer , recognized the " natural slope " of different soils in *num* , an idea later known as the soil's angle of repose .
a rudimentary soil classification system was also developed based on a material's unit weight , which is no longer considered a good indication of soil type .
the application of the principles of mechanics to soils was documented as early as *num* when charles coulomb ( a physicist , engineer , and army captain ) developed improved methods to determine the earth pressures against military ramparts .
coulomb observed that , at failure , a distinct slip plane would form behind a sliding retaining wall and he suggested that the maximum shear stress on the slip plane , for design purposes , was the sum of the soil cohesion , formula_1 , and friction formula_2 formula_3 , where formula_2 is the normal stress on the slip plane and formula_5 is the friction angle of the soil .
by combining coulomb's theory with christian otto mohr's 2d stress state , the theory became known as mohr-coulomb theory .
although it is now recognized that precise determination of cohesion is impossible because formula_1 is not a fundamental soil property , the mohr-coulomb theory is still used in practice today .
in the *ord* century henry darcy developed what is now known as darcy's law describing the flow of fluids in porous media .
joseph boussinesq ( a mathematician and physicist ) developed theories of stress distribution in elastic solids that proved useful for estimating stresses at depth in the ground ; william rankine , an engineer and physicist , developed an alternative to coulomb's earth pressure theory .
albert atterberg developed the clay consistency indices that are still used today for soil classification .
osborne reynolds recognized in *num* that shearing causes volumetric dilation of dense and contraction of loose granular materials .
modern geotechnical engineering is said to have begun in *num* with the publication of " erdbaumechanik " by karl terzaghi ( a mechanical engineer and geologist ) .
considered by many to be the father of modern soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering , terzaghi developed the principle of effective stress , and demonstrated that the shear strength of soil is controlled by effective stress .
terzaghi also developed the framework for theories of bearing capacity of foundations , and the theory for prediction of the rate of settlement of clay layers due to consolidation .
in his *num* book , donald taylor recognized that interlocking and dilation of densely packed particles contributed to the peak strength of a soil .
the interrelationships between volume change behavior ( dilation , contraction , and consolidation ) and shearing behavior were all connected via the theory of plasticity using critical state soil mechanics by roscoe , schofield , and wroth with the publication of " on the yielding of soils " in *num* .
critical state soil mechanics is the basis for many contemporary advanced constitutive models describing the behavior of soil .
geotechnical centrifuge modeling is a method of testing physical scale models of geotechnical problems .
the use of a centrifuge enhances the similarity of the scale model tests involving soil because the strength and stiffness of soil is very sensitive to the confining pressure .
the centrifugal acceleration allows a researcher to obtain large ( prototype-scale ) stresses in small physical models .
geotechnical engineers are typically graduates of a four-year civil engineering program and some hold a masters degree .
in the usa , geotechnical engineers are typically licensed and regulated as professional engineers ( pes ) in most states ; currently only california and oregon have licensed geotechnical engineering specialties .
the academy of geo-professionals ( agp ) began issuing diplomate , geotechnical engineering ( d .
ge ) certification in *num* .
state governments will typically license engineers who have graduated from an abet accredited school , passed the fundamentals of engineering examination , completed several years of work experience under the supervision of a licensed professional engineer , and passed the professional engineering examination .
in geotechnical engineering , soils are considered a three-phase material composed of : rock or mineral particles , water and air .
the voids of a soil , the spaces in between mineral particles , contain the water and air .
the engineering properties of soils are affected by four main factors : the predominant size of the mineral particles , the type of mineral particles , the grain size distribution , and the relative quantities of mineral , water and air present in the soil matrix .
fine particles ( fines ) are defined as particles less than *num* .
*num* mm in diameter .
some of the important properties of soils that are used by geotechnical engineers to analyze site conditions and design earthworks , retaining structures , and foundations are : formula_7 formula_8 geotechnical engineers and engineering geologists perform geotechnical investigations to obtain information on the physical properties of soil and rock underlying ( and sometimes adjacent to ) a site to design earthworks and foundations for proposed structures , and for repair of distress to earthworks and structures caused by subsurface conditions .
a geotechnical investigation will include surface exploration and subsurface exploration of a site .
sometimes , geophysical methods are used to obtain data about sites .
subsurface exploration usually involves in-situ testing ( two common examples of in-situ tests are the standard penetration test and cone penetration test ) .
in addition site investigation will often include subsurface sampling and laboratory testing of the soil samples retrieved .
the digging of test pits and trenching ( particularly for locating faults and slide planes ) may also be used to learn about soil conditions at depth .
large diameter borings are rarely used due to safety concerns and expense , but are sometimes used to allow a geologist or engineer to be lowered into the borehole for direct visual and manual examination of the soil and rock stratigraphy .
a variety of soil samplers exist to meet the needs of different engineering projects .
the standard penetration test ( spt ) , which uses a thick-walled split spoon sampler , is the most common way to collect disturbed samples .
piston samplers , employing a thin-walled tube , are most commonly used for the collection of less disturbed samples .
more advanced methods , such as ground freezing and the sherbrooke block sampler , are superior , but even more expensive .
atterberg limits tests , water content measurements , and grain size analysis , for example , may be performed on disturbed samples obtained from thick walled soil samplers .
properties such as shear strength , stiffness hydraulic conductivity , and coefficient of consolidation may be significantly altered by sample disturbance .
to measure these properties in the laboratory , high quality sampling is required .
common tests to measure the strength and stiffness include the triaxial shear and unconfined compression test .
surface exploration can include geologic mapping , geophysical methods , and photogrammetry ; or it can be as simple as an engineer walking around to observe the physical conditions at the site .
geologic mapping and interpretation of geomorphology is typically completed in consultation with a geologist or engineering geologist .
geophysical exploration is also sometimes used .
geophysical techniques used for subsurface exploration include measurement of seismic waves ( pressure , shear , and rayleigh waves ) , surface-wave methods and / or downhole methods , and electromagnetic surveys ( magnetometer , resistivity , and ground-penetrating radar ) .
a building's foundation transmits loads from buildings and other structures to the earth .
geotechnical engineers design foundations based on the load characteristics of the structure and the properties of the soils and / or bedrock at the site .
in general , geotechnical engineers : the primary considerations for foundation support are bearing capacity , settlement , and ground movement beneath the foundations .
bearing capacity is the ability of the site soils to support the loads imposed by buildings or structures .
settlement occurs under all foundations in all soil conditions , though lightly loaded structures or rock sites may experience negligible settlements .
for heavier structures or softer sites , both overall settlement relative to unbuilt areas or neighboring buildings , and differential settlement under a single structure , can be concerns .
of particular concern is settlement which occurs over time , as immediate settlement can usually be compensated for during construction .
ground movement beneath a structure's foundations can occur due to shrinkage or swell of expansive soils due to climatic changes , frost expansion of soil , melting of permafrost , slope instability , or other causes .
all these factors must be considered during design of foundations .
many building codes specify basic foundation design parameters for simple conditions , frequently varying by jurisdiction , but such design techniques are normally limited to certain types of construction and certain types of sites , and are frequently very conservative .
in areas of shallow bedrock , most foundations may bear directly on bedrock ; in other areas , the soil may provide sufficient strength for the support of structures .
in areas of deeper bedrock with soft overlying soils , deep foundations are used to support structures directly on the bedrock ; in areas where bedrock is not economically available , stiff " bearing layers " are used to support deep foundations instead .
shallow foundations are a type of foundation that transfers building load to the very near the surface , rather than to a subsurface layer .
shallow foundations typically have a depth to width ratio of less than *num* .
footings ( often called " spread footings " because they spread the load ) are structural elements which transfer structure loads to the ground by direct areal contact .
footings can be isolated footings for point or column loads , or strip footings for wall or other long ( line ) loads .
footings are normally constructed from reinforced concrete cast directly onto the soil , and are typically embedded into the ground to penetrate through the zone of frost movement and / or to obtain additional bearing capacity .
a variant on spread footings is to have the entire structure bear on a single slab of concrete underlying the entire area of the structure .
slabs must be thick enough to provide sufficient rigidity to spread the bearing loads somewhat uniformly , and to minimize differential settlement across the foundation .
in some cases , flexure is allowed and the building is constructed to tolerate small movements of the foundation instead .
for small structures , like single-family houses , the slab may be less than *num* mm thick ; for larger structures , the foundation slab may be several meters thick .
slab foundations can be either slab-on-grade foundations or embedded foundations , typically in buildings with basements .
slab-on-grade foundations must be designed to allow for potential ground movement due to changing soil conditions .
deep foundations are used for structures or heavy loads when shallow foundations cannot provide adequate capacity , due to size and structural limitations .
they may also be used to transfer building loads past weak or compressible soil layers .
while shallow foundations rely solely on the bearing capacity of the soil beneath them , deep foundations can rely on end bearing resistance , frictional resistance along their length , or both in developing the required capacity .
geotechnical engineers use specialized tools , such as the cone penetration test , to estimate the amount of skin and end bearing resistance available in the subsurface .
there are many types of deep foundations including piles , drilled shafts , caissons , piers , and earth stabilized columns .
large buildings such as skyscrapers typically require deep foundations .
for example , the jin mao tower in china uses tubular steel piles about 1m ( *num* .
*num* feet ) driven to a depth of *num* .
5m ( *num* feet ) to support its weight .
in buildings that are constructed and found to undergo settlement , underpinning piles can be used to stabilise the existing building .
there are three ways to place piles for a deep foundation .
they can be driven , drilled , or installed by use of an auger .
driven piles are extended to their necessary depths with the application of external energy in the same way a nail is hammered .
there are four typical hammers used to drive such piles : drop hammers , diesel hammers , hydraulic hammers , and air hammers .
drop hammers simply drop a heavy weight onto the pile to drive it , while diesel hammers use a single cylinder diesel engine to force piles through the earth .
similarly , hydraulic and air hammers supply energy to piles through hydraulic and air forces .
energy imparted from a hammer head varies with type of hammer chosen , and can be as high as a million foot pounds for large scale diesel hammers , a very common hammer head used in practice .
piles are made of a variety of material including steel , timber , and concrete .
drilled piles are created by first drilling a hole to the appropriate depth , and filling it with concrete .
drilled piles can typically carry more load than driven piles , simply due to a larger diameter pile .
the auger method of pile installation is similar to drilled pile installation , but concrete is pumped into the hole as the auger is being removed .
a retaining wall is a structure that holds back earth .
retaining walls stabilize soil and rock from downslope movement or erosion and provide support for vertical or near-vertical grade changes .
cofferdams and bulkheads , structures to hold back water , are sometimes also considered retaining walls .
the primary geotechnical concern in design and installation of retaining walls is that the weight of the retained material is creates lateral earth pressure behind the wall , which can cause the wall to deform or fail .
the lateral earth pressure depends on the height of the wall , the density of the soil , the strength of the soil , and the amount of allowable movement of the wall .
this pressure is smallest at the top and increases toward the bottom in a manner similar to hydraulic pressure , and tends to push the wall away from the backfill .
groundwater behind the wall that is not dissipated by a drainage system causes an additional horizontal hydraulic pressure on the wall .
gravity walls depend on the size and weight of the wall mass to resist pressures from behind .
gravity walls will often have a slight setback , or batter , to improve wall stability .
for short , landscaping walls , gravity walls made from dry-stacked ( mortarless ) stone or segmental concrete units ( masonry units ) are commonly used .
earlier in the *ord* century , taller retaining walls were often gravity walls made from large masses of concrete or stone .
today , taller retaining walls are increasingly built as composite gravity walls such as : geosynthetic or steel-reinforced backfill soil with precast facing ; gabions ( stacked steel wire baskets filled with rocks ) , crib walls ( cells built up log cabin style from precast concrete or timber and filled with soil or free draining gravel ) or soil-nailed walls ( soil reinforced in place with steel and concrete rods ) .
for " reinforced-soil gravity walls " , the soil reinforcement is placed in horizontal layers throughout the height of the wall .
commonly , the soil reinforcement is " geogrid " , a high-strength polymer mesh , that provide tensile strength to hold soil together .
the wall face is often of precast , segmental concrete units that can tolerate some differential movement .
the reinforced soil's mass , along with the facing , becomes the gravity wall .
the reinforced mass must be built large enough to retain the pressures from the soil behind it .
gravity walls usually must be a minimum of *num* to *num* percent as deep ( thick ) as the height of the wall , and may have to be larger if there is a slope or surcharge on the wall .
prior to the introduction of modern reinforced-soil gravity walls , cantilevered walls were the most common type of taller retaining wall .
cantilevered walls are made from a relatively thin stem of steel-reinforced , cast-in-place concrete or mortared masonry ( often in the shape of an inverted t ) .
these walls cantilever loads ( like a beam ) to a large , structural footing ; converting horizontal pressures from behind the wall to vertical pressures on the ground below .
sometimes cantilevered walls are buttressed on the front , or include a counterfort on the back , to improve their stability against high loads .
buttresses are short wing walls at right angles to the main trend of the wall .
these walls require rigid concrete footings below seasonal frost depth .
this type of wall uses much less material than a traditional gravity wall .
cantilever walls resist lateral pressures by friction at the base of the wall and / or " passive earth pressure " , the tendency of the soil to resist lateral movement .
basements are a form of cantilever walls , but the forces on the basement walls are greater than on conventional walls because the basement wall is not free to move .
shoring of temporary excavations frequently requires a wall design which does not extend laterally beyond the wall , so shoring extends below the planned base of the excavation .
common methods of shoring are the use of " sheet piles " or " soldier beams and lagging " .
sheet piles are a form of driven piling using thin interlocking sheets of steel to obtain a continuous barrier in the ground , and are driven prior to excavation .
soldier beams are constructed of wide flange steel h sections spaced about 2–3 m apart , driven prior to excavation .
as the excavation proceeds , horizontal timber or steel sheeting ( lagging ) is inserted behind the h pile flanges .
in some cases , the lateral support which can be provided by the shoring wall alone is insufficient to resist the planned lateral loads ; in this case additional support is provided by walers or tie-backs .
walers are structural elements which connect across the excavation so that the loads from the soil on either side of the excavation are used to resist each other , or which transfer horizontal loads from the shoring wall to the base of the excavation .
tie-backs are steel tendons drilled into the face of the wall which extend beyond the soil which is applying pressure to the wall , to provide additional lateral resistance to the wall .
ground improvement is a technique that improves the engineering properties of the treated soil mass .
usually , the properties modified are shear strength , stiffness and permeability .
ground improvement has developed into a sophisticated tool to support foundations for a wide variety of structures .
properly applied , i .
e .
after giving due consideration to the nature of the ground being improved and the type and sensitivity of the structures being built , ground improvement often reduces direct costs and saves time .
slope stability is the potential of soil covered slopes to withstand and undergo movement .
stability is determined by the balance of shear stress and shear strength .
a previously stable slope may be initially affected by preparatory factors , making the slope conditionally unstable .
triggering factors of a slope failure can be climatic events can then make a slope actively unstable , leading to mass movements .
mass movements can be caused by increases in shear stress , such as loading , lateral pressure , and transient forces .
alternatively , shear strength may be decreased by weathering , changes in pore water pressure , and organic material .
several modes of failure for earth slopes include falls , topples , slides , and flows .
in slopes with coarse grained soil or rocks , falls typically occur as the rapid descent of rocks and other loose slope material .
a slope topples when a large column of soil tilts over its vertical axis at failure .
typical slope stability analysis considers sliding failures , categorized mainly as rotational slides or translational slides .
as implied by the name , rotational slides fail along a generally curved surface , while translational slides fail along a more planar surface .
a slope failing as a flow would resemble a fluid flowing downhill .
stability analysis is needed for the design of engineered slopes and for estimating the risk of slope failure in natural or designed slopes .
a common assumption is that a slope consists of a layer of soil sitting on top of a rigid base .
the mass and the base are assumed to interact via friction .
the interface between the mass and the base can be planar , curved , or have some other complex geometry .
the goal of a slope stability analysis is to determine the conditions under which the mass will slip relative to the base and lead to slope failure .
if the interface between the mass and the base of a slope has a complex geometry , slope stability analysis is difficult and numerical solution methods are required .
typically , the exact geometry of the interface is not known and a simplified interface geometry is assumed .
finite slopes require three-dimensional models to be analyzed .
to keep the problem simple , most slopes are analyzed assuming that the slopes are infinitely wide and can therefore be represented by two-dimensional models .
a slope can be drained or undrained .
the undrained condition is used in the calculations to produce conservative estimates of risk .
a popular stability analysis approach is based on principles pertaining to the limit equilibrium concept .
this method analyzes a finite or infinite slope as if it were about to fail along its sliding failure surface .
equilibrium stresses are calculated along the failure plane , and compared to the soils shear strength as determined by terzaghi’s shear strength equation .
stability is ultimately decided by a factor of safety equal to the ratio of shear strength to the equilibrium stresses along the failure surface .
a factor of safety greater than one generally implies a stable slope , failure of which should not occur assuming the slope is undisturbed .
a factor of safety of *num* .
*num* for static conditions is commonly used in practice .
"offshore " ( or " marine " ) " geotechnical engineering " is concerned with foundation design for human-made structures in the sea , away from the coastline ( in opposition to " onshore " or " nearshore " ) .
oil platforms , artificial islands and submarine pipelines are examples of such structures .
there are number of significant differences between onshore and offshore geotechnical engineering .
notably , ground improvement ( on the seabed ) and site investigation are more expensive , the offshore structures are exposed to a wider range of geohazards , and the environmental and financial consequences are higher in case of failure .
offshore structures are exposed to various environmental loads , notably wind , waves and currents .
these phenomena may affect the integrity or the serviceability of the structure and its foundation during its operational lifespan – they need to be taken into account in offshore design .
in subsea geotechnical engineering , seabed materials are considered a two-phase material composed of *num* ) rock or mineral particles and *num* ) water .
structures may be fixed in place in the seabed—as is the case for piers , jettys and fixed-bottom wind turbines—or may be a floating structure that remain roughly fixed relative to its geotechnical anchor point .
undersea mooring of human-engineered floating structures include a large number of offshore oil and gas platforms and , since *num* , a few floating wind turbines .
two common types of engineered design for anchoring floating structures include tension-leg and catenary loose mooring systems .
" tension leg mooring systems have vertical tethers under tension providing large restoring moments in pitch and roll .
catenary mooring systems provide station keeping for an offshore structure yet provide little stiffness at low tensions .
" geosynthetics are a type of plastic polymer products used in geotechnical engineering that improve engineering performance while reducing costs .
this includes geotextiles , geogrids , geomembranes , geocells , and geocomposites .
the synthetic nature of the products make them suitable for use in the ground where high levels of durability are required ; their main functions include : drainage , filtration , reinforcement , separation and containment .
geosynthetics are available in a wide range of forms and materials , each to suit a slightly different end use , although they are frequently used together .
these products have a wide range of applications and are currently used in many civil and geotechnical engineering applications including : roads , airfields , railroads , embankments , piled embankments , retaining structures , reservoirs , canals , dams , landfills , bank protection and coastal engineering .
appellate court an appellate court , commonly called an appeals court , court of appeals ( american english ) , appeal court ( british english ) , court of second instance or second instance court , is any court of law that is empowered to hear an appeal of a trial court or other lower tribunal .
in most jurisdictions , the court system is divided into at least three levels : the trial court , which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case ; at least one intermediate appellate court ; and a supreme court ( or court of last resort ) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts .
a jurisdiction's supreme court is that jurisdiction's highest appellate court .
appellate courts nationwide can operate under varying rules .
the authority of appellate courts to review the decisions of lower courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another .
in some areas , the appellate court has limited powers of review .
generally , an appellate court's judgment provides the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed , setting out with specificity the court's determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed , reversed , remanded or modified .
while many appellate courts have jurisdiction over all cases decided by lower courts , some systems have appellate courts divided by the type of jurisdiction they exercise .
some jurisdictions have specialized appellate courts , such as the texas court of criminal appeals , which only hears appeals raised in criminal cases , and the u .
s .
court of appeals for the federal circuit , which has general jurisdiction but derives most of its caseload from patent cases , on one hand , and appeals from the court of federal claims on the other .
in the united states , alabama , tennessee , and oklahoma also have separate courts of criminal appeals .
texas and oklahoma have the final determination of criminal cases vested in their respective courts of criminal appeals , while alabama and tennessee allow decisions of its court of criminal appeals to be finally appealed to the state supreme court .
court of criminal appeals include : the court of appeal of new zealand , located in wellington , is new zealand's principal intermediate appellate court .
in practice , most appeals are resolved at this intermediate appellate level , rather than in the supreme court .
the court of appeal of sri lanka , located in colombo , is the second senior court in the sri lankan legal system .
in the united states , both state and federal appellate courts are usually restricted to examining whether the lower court made the correct legal determinations , rather than hearing direct evidence and determining what the facts of the case were .
furthermore , u .
s .
appellate courts are usually restricted to hearing appeals based on matters that were originally brought up before the trial court .
hence , such an appellate court will not consider an appellant's argument if it is based on a theory that is raised for the first time in the appeal .
in most u .
s .
states , and in u .
s .
federal courts , parties before the court are allowed one appeal as of right .
this means that a party who is unsatisfied with the outcome of a trial may bring an appeal to contest that outcome .
however , appeals may be costly , and the appellate court must find an error on the part of the court below that justifies upsetting the verdict .
therefore , only a small proportion of trial court decisions result in appeals .
some appellate courts , particularly supreme courts , have the power of discretionary review , meaning that they can decide whether they will hear an appeal brought in a particular case .
many u .
s .
jurisdictions title their appellate court an court of appeal or court of appeals .
historically , others have titled their appellate court a court of errors ( or court of errors and appeals ) , on the premise that it was intended to correct errors made by lower courts .
examples of such courts include the new jersey court of errors and appeals ( which existed from *num* to *num* ) , the connecticut supreme court of errors ( which has been renamed the connecticut supreme court ) , the kentucky court of errors ( renamed the kentucky supreme court ) , and the mississippi high court of errors and appeals ( since renamed the supreme court of mississippi ) .
in some jurisdictions , a court able to hear appeals is known as an appellate division .
the phrase " court of appeals " most often refers to intermediate appellate courts .
however , the maryland and new york systems are different .
the maryland court of appeals and the new york court of appeals are the highest appellate courts in those states .
the new york supreme court is a trial court of general jurisdiction .
depending on the system , certain courts may serve as both trial courts and appellate courts , hearing appeals of decisions made by courts with more limited jurisdiction .
bipolar disorder bipolar disorder , previously known as manic depression , is a mental disorder that causes periods of depression and periods of abnormally elevated mood .
the elevated mood is significant and is known as mania or hypomania , depending on its severity , or whether symptoms of psychosis are present .
during mania , an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic , happy , or irritable .
individuals often make poorly thought out decisions with little regard to the consequences .
the need for sleep is usually reduced during manic phases .
during periods of depression , there may be crying , a negative outlook on life , and poor eye contact with others .
the risk of suicide among those with the illness is high at greater than *num* percent over *num* years , while self-harm occurs in 30–40 percent .
other mental health issues such as anxiety disorders and substance use disorder are commonly associated with bipolar disorder .
the causes are not clearly understood , but both environmental and genetic factors play a role .
many genes of small effect contribute to risk .
environmental risk factors include a history of childhood abuse and long-term stress .
about *num* % of the risk is attributed to genetics .
the condition is classified as bipolar i disorder if there has been at least one manic episode , with or without depressive episodes , and as bipolar ii disorder if there has been at least one hypomanic episode ( but no manic episodes ) and one major depressive episode .
in those with less severe symptoms of a prolonged duration , the condition cyclothymic disorder may be diagnosed .
if the symptoms are due to drugs or medical problems , it is classified separately .
other conditions that may present similarly include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , personality disorders , schizophrenia and substance use disorder as well as a number of medical conditions .
medical testing is not required for a diagnosis , though blood tests or medical imaging can be done to rule out other problems .
treatment commonly includes psychotherapy as well as medications such as mood stabilizers and antipsychotics .
examples of mood stabilizers that are commonly used include lithium and various anticonvulsants .
involuntary treatment in a hospital may be needed if a person is a risk to themselves or others but refuses treatment .
severe behavioral problems , such as agitation or combativeness , may be managed with short term antipsychotics or benzodiazepines .
in periods of mania , it is recommended that antidepressants be stopped .
if antidepressants are used for periods of depression , they should be used with a mood stabilizer .
electroconvulsive therapy ( ect ) , while not very well studied , may be tried for those who do not respond to other treatments .
if treatments are stopped , it is recommended that this be done slowly .
many individuals have financial , social or work-related problems due to the illness .
these difficulties occur a quarter to a third of the time , on average .
due to lifestyle choices and the side effects of medications , the risk of death from natural causes such as heart disease in people with bipolar is twice that of the general population .
bipolar disorder affects approximately *num* % of the global population .
in the united states , about *num* % are estimated to be affected at some point in their life ; rates appear to be similar in females and males .
the most common age at which symptoms begin is *num* .
the economic cost of the disorder has been estimated at $45 billion for the united states in *num* .
a large proportion of this was related to a higher number of missed work days , estimated at *num* per year .
people with bipolar disorder often face problems with social stigma .
both mania and depression are characterized by disruptions in normal mood , psychomotor activity , circadian rhythm , and cognition .
mania can present with varying levels of mood disturbance , ranging from euphoria that is associated with " classic mania " to dysphoria and irritability .
the core symptom of mania involves an increase in energy of psychomotor activity .
mania can also present with increased self-esteem or grandiosity , rapid speech , the subjective feeling of rapid thoughts , disinhibited social behavior , or impulsivity .
mania is distinguished from hypomania by length , as hypomania requires four consecutive days , and mania requires more than a week .
unlike mania , hypomania is not always associated with impaired functioning .
the biological mechanisms responsible for switching from a manic or hypomanic episode to a depressive episode , or vice versa , remain poorly understood .
mania is a distinct period of at least one week of elevated or irritable mood , which can range from euphoria to delirium , and those experiencing hypomania or mania generally exhibit several of the following behaviors : speaking in a rapid , uninterruptible manner , decreased need for sleep , short attention span , racing thoughts , increased goal-oriented activities , agitation , or exhibition of behaviors characterized as impulsive or high-risk , such as hypersexuality or excessive spending .
to meet the definition for a manic episode , these behaviors must impair the individual's ability to socialize or work .
if untreated , a manic episode usually lasts three to six months .
manic individuals often have a history of substance abuse developed over years as a form of " self-medication " .
at the most extreme , a person in a full-blown manic state can experience psychosis : a break with reality , a state in which thinking is affected along with mood .
they may feel unstoppable , or as if they have been " chosen " and are on a " special mission " , or have other grandiose or delusional ideas .
this may lead to violent behavior and , sometimes , hospitalization in an inpatient psychiatric hospital .
the severity of manic symptoms can be measured by rating scales such as the young mania rating scale , though questions remain about the reliability of these scales .
the onset of a manic or depressive episode is often foreshadowed by sleep disturbances .
mood changes , psychomotor and appetite changes , and an increase in anxiety can also occur up to three weeks before a manic episode develops .
hypomania is the milder form of mania , defined as at least four days of the same criteria as mania , but which does not cause a significant decrease in the individual's ability to socialize or work , lacks psychotic features such as delusions or hallucinations , and does not require psychiatric hospitalization .
overall functioning may actually increase during episodes of hypomania and is thought to serve as a defense mechanism against depression by some .
hypomanic episodes rarely progress to full-blown manic episodes .
some people who experience hypomania show increased creativity while others are irritable or demonstrate poor judgment .
hypomania may feel good to some persons who experience it , though most people who experience hypomania state that the stress of the experience is very painful .
bipolar people who experience hypomania , however , tend to forget the effects of their actions on those around them .
even when family and friends recognize mood swings , the individual will often deny that anything is wrong .
what might be called a " hypomanic event " , if not accompanied by depressive episodes , is often not deemed problematic , unless the mood changes are uncontrollable , or volatile .
most commonly , symptoms continue for a few weeks to a few months .
symptoms of the depressive phase of bipolar disorder include persistent feelings of sadness , irritability or anger , loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities , excessive or inappropriate guilt , hopelessness , sleeping too much or not enough , changes in appetite and / or weight , fatigue , problems concentrating , self-loathing or feelings of worthlessness , and thoughts of death or suicide .
in severe cases , the individual may develop symptoms of psychosis , a condition also known as " severe bipolar disorder with psychotic features " .
these symptoms include delusions and hallucinations .
a major depressive episode persists for at least two weeks , and may result in suicide if left untreated .
the earlier the age of onset , the more likely the first few episodes are to be depressive .
since a diagnosis of bipolar disorder requires a manic or hypomanic episode , many affected individuals are initially misdiagnosed as having major depression and then incorrectly treated with prescribed antidepressants .
in bipolar disorder , mixed state is a condition during which symptoms of both mania and depression occur simultaneously .
individuals experiencing a mixed state may have manic symptoms such as grandiose thoughts while simultaneously experiencing depressive symptoms such as excessive guilt or feeling suicidal .
mixed states are considered to be high-risk for suicidal behavior since depressive emotions such as hopelessness are often paired with mood swings or difficulties with impulse control .
anxiety disorders occur more frequently as a comorbidity in mixed bipolar episodes than in non-mixed bipolar depression or mania .
substance abuse ( including alcohol ) also follows this trend , thereby appearing to depict bipolar symptoms as no more than a consequence of substance abuse .
associated features are clinical phenomena that often accompany the disorder but are not part of the diagnostic criteria .
in adults with the condition , bipolar disorder is often accompanied by changes in cognitive processes and abilities .
these include reduced attentional and executive capabilities and impaired memory .
how the individual processes the universe also depends on the phase of the disorder , with differential characteristics between the manic , hypomanic and depressive states .
those with bipolar disorder may have difficulty in maintaining relationships .
there are several common childhood precursors seen in children who later receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder , such as mood abnormalities ( including major depressive episodes ) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ) .
the diagnosis of bipolar disorder can be complicated by coexisting ( comorbid ) psychiatric conditions including the following : obsessive-compulsive disorder , substance-use disorder , eating disorders , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , social phobia , premenstrual syndrome ( including premenstrual dysphoric disorder ) , or panic disorder .
a careful longitudinal analysis of symptoms and episodes , enriched if possible by discussions with friends and family members , is crucial to establishing a treatment plan where these comorbidities exist .
the causes of bipolar disorder likely vary between individuals and the exact mechanism underlying the disorder remains unclear .
genetic influences are believed to account for 60–80 percent of the risk of developing the disorder indicating a strong hereditary component .
the overall heritability of the bipolar spectrum has been estimated at *num* .
*num* .
twin studies have been limited by relatively small sample sizes but have indicated a substantial genetic contribution , as well as environmental influence .
for bipolar disorder type i , the rate at which identical twins ( same genes ) will both have bipolar disorder type i ( concordance ) is estimated at around *num* percent , compared to about *num* percent in fraternal twins .
a combination of bipolar i , ii , and cyclothymia similarly produced rates of *num* percent and *num* percent ( identical and fraternal twins , respectively ) , with a relatively lower ratio for bipolar ii that likely reflects heterogeneity .
there is overlap with major ( unipolar ) depression and if this is also counted in the co-twin the concordance with bipolar disorder rises to *num* percent in identical twins and *num* percent in fraternal twins .
the relatively low concordance between fraternal twins brought up together suggests that shared family environmental effects are limited , although the ability to detect them has been limited by small sample sizes .
estrogen in women , has been linked to bipolar disorder .
behavioral genetic studies have suggested that many chromosomal regions and candidate genes are related to bipolar disorder susceptibility with each gene exerting a mild to moderate effect .
the risk of bipolar disorder is nearly ten-fold higher in first degree-relatives of those affected with bipolar disorder when compared to the general population ; similarly , the risk of major depressive disorder is three times higher in relatives of those with bipolar disorder when compared to the general population .
although the first genetic linkage finding for mania was in *num* , the linkage studies have been inconsistent .
the largest and most recent genome-wide association study ( gwas ) failed to find any particular locus that exerts a large effect , reinforcing the idea that no single gene is responsible for bipolar disorder in most cases .
polymorphisms in " bdnf " , " drd4 " , " dao " , and " tph1 " have been frequently associated with bipolar disorder and were initially successful in a meta-analysis , but failed after correction for multiple testing .
on the other hand , two polymorphisms in " tph2 " were identified as being associated with bipolar disorder .
due to the inconsistent findings in a genome-wide association study , multiple studies have undertaken the approach of analyzing single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) in biological pathways .
signaling pathways traditionally associated with bipolar disorder that have been supported by these studies include corticotropin-releasing hormone ( crh ) signaling , cardiac β-adrenergic signaling , phospholipase c signaling , glutamate receptor signaling , cardiac hypertrophy signaling , wnt signaling , notch signaling , and endothelin *num* signaling .
of the *num* genes identified in these pathways , three were found to be dysregulated in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex portion of the brain in post-mortem studies , " cacna1c " , " gng2 " , and " itpr2 " .
findings point strongly to heterogeneity , with different genes being implicated in different families .
robust and replicable genome-wide significant associations showed several common snps , including variants within the genes " cacna1c " , " odz4 " , and " ncan " .
bipolar disorder is associated with reduced expression of specific dna repair enzymes and increased levels of oxidative dna damages .
advanced paternal age has been linked to a somewhat increased chance of bipolar disorder in offspring , consistent with a hypothesis of increased new genetic mutations .
psychosocial factors play a significant role in the development and course of bipolar disorder , and individual psychosocial variables may interact with genetic dispositions .
it is probable that recent life events and interpersonal relationships contribute to the onset and recurrence of bipolar mood episodes , just as they do for unipolar depression .
in surveys , 30–50 percent of adults diagnosed with bipolar disorder report traumatic / abusive experiences in childhood , which is associated with earlier onset , a higher rate of suicide attempts , and more co-occurring disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) .
the number of reported stressful events in childhood is higher in those with an adult diagnosis of bipolar spectrum disorder compared to those without , particularly events stemming from a harsh environment rather than from the child's own behavior .
less commonly , bipolar disorder or a bipolar-like disorder may occur as a result of or in association with a neurological condition or injury .
conditions like these and injuries include stroke , traumatic brain injury , hiv infection , multiple sclerosis , porphyria , and rarely temporal lobe epilepsy .
abnormalities in the structure and / or function of certain brain circuits could underlie bipolar disorder .
meta-analyses of structural mri studies in bipolar disorder report decreased volume in the left rostral anterior cingulate cortex ( acc ) , fronto-insular cortex , ventral prefrontal cortex , and claustrum .
increases have been reported in the volume of the lateral ventricles , globus pallidus , subgenual anterior cingulate , and amygdala as well as in the rates of deep white matter hyperintensities .
functional mri findings suggest that abnormal modulation between ventral prefrontal and limbic regions , especially the amygdala , likely contributes to poor emotional regulation and mood symptoms .
pharmacological treatment of mania increases ventral prefrontal cortex ( vpfc ) activity , normalizing it relative to controls , suggesting that vpfc hypoactivity is an indicator of mood state .
on the other hand , pretreatment hyperactivity in the amygdala is reduced post-treatment but is still increased relative to controls , suggesting that it is a trait marker .
manic and depressive episodes tend to be characterized by ventral versus dorsal dysfunction in the ventral prefrontal cortex .
during attentional tasks and resting , mania is associated with decreased orbitofrontal cortex activity , while depression is associated with increased resting metabolism .
consistent with affective disorders due to lesions , mania and depression are lateralized in vpfc dysfunction , with depression primarily being associated with the left vpfc , and mania the right vpfc .
abnormal vpfc activity , along with amygdala hyperactivity is found during euthymia as well as in healthy relatives of those with bipolar , indicating possible trait features .
euthymic bipolar people show decreased activity in the lingual gyrus , while people who are manic demonstrate decreased activity in the inferior frontal cortex , while no differences were found in people with bipolar depression .
people with bipolar have increased activation of left hemisphere ventral limbic areas and decreased activation of right hemisphere cortical structures related to cognition .
one proposed model for bipolar disorder suggests that hypersensitivity of reward circuits consisting of frontostriatal circuits causes mania , and hyposensitivity of these circuits causes depression .
according to the " kindling " hypothesis , when people who are genetically predisposed toward bipolar disorder experience stressful events , the stress threshold at which mood changes occur becomes progressively lower , until the episodes eventually start ( and recur ) spontaneously .
there is evidence supporting an association between early-life stress and dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ( hpa axis ) leading to its overactivation , which may play a role in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder .
some of the brain components which have been proposed to play a role are the mitochondria and a sodium atpase pump .
circadian rhythms and regulation of the hormone melatonin also seem to be altered .
dopamine , a known neurotransmitter responsible for mood cycling , has been shown to have increased transmission during the manic phase .
the dopamine hypothesis states that the increase in dopamine results in secondary homeostatic downregulation of key systems and receptors such as an increase in dopamine-mediated g protein-coupled receptors .
this results in decreased dopamine transmission characteristic of the depressive phase .
the depressive phase ends with homeostatic up regulation potentially restarting the cycle over again .
glutamate is significantly increased within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the manic phase of bipolar disorder , and returns to normal levels once the phase is over .
the increase in " gamma"-aminobutyric acid ( gaba ) is possibly caused by a disturbance in early development causing a disturbance of cell migration and the formation of normal lamination , the layering of brain structures commonly associated with the cerebral cortex .
medications used to treat bipolar may exert their effect by modulating intracellular signaling , such as through depleting myo-inositol levels , inhibition of camp signaling , and through altering g coupled proteins .
consistent with this , elevated levels of g , g , and g have been reported in brain and blood samples , along with increased protein kinase a expression and sensitivity .
decreased levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid , a byproduct of serotonin , are present in the cerebrospinal fluid of persons with bipolar disorder during both the depressed and manic phases .
increased dopaminergic activity has been hypothesized in manic states due to the ability of dopamine agonists to stimulate mania in people with bipolar disorder .
decreased sensitivity of regulatory α adrenergic receptors as well as increased cell counts in the locus ceruleus indicated increased noradrenergic activity in manic people .
low plasma gaba levels on both sides of the mood spectrum have been found .
one review found no difference in monoamine levels , but found abnormal norepinephrine turnover in people with bipolar disorder .
tyrosine depletion was found to reduce the effects of methamphetamine in people with bipolar disorder as well as symptoms of mania , implicating dopamine in mania .
vmat2 binding was found to be increased in one study of people with bipolar mania .
bipolar disorder is commonly diagnosed during adolescence or early adulthood , but onset can occur throughout the life cycle .
the disorder can be difficult to distinguish from unipolar depression and the average delay in diagnosis is 5–10 years after symptoms begin .
diagnosis of bipolar disorder takes several factors into account and considers the self-reported experiences of the symptomatic individual , abnormal behavior reported by family members , friends or co-workers , observable signs of illness as assessed by a clinician , and often a medical work-up to rule-out medical causes .
in diagnosis , caregiver-scored rating scales , specifically the mother , has been found to be more accurate than teacher and youth report in predicting identifying youths with bipolar disorder .
assessment is usually done on an outpatient basis ; admission to an inpatient facility is considered if there is a risk to oneself or others .
the most widely used criteria for diagnosing bipolar disorder are from the american psychiatric association's ( apa ) " diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders " , fifth edition ( dsm-5 ) and the world health organization's ( who ) " international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems " , *ord* edition ( icd-10 ) .
the icd-10 criteria are used more often in clinical settings outside of the u .
s .
while the dsm criteria are used clinically within the u .
s .
and are the prevailing criteria used internationally in research studies .
the dsm-5 , published in *num* , included further and more accurate specifiers compared to its predecessor , the dsm-iv-tr .
semi structured interviews such as the kiddie schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia ( ksads ) and the structured clinical interview for dsm-iv ( scid ) are used for diagnostic confirmation of bipolar disorder .
several rating scales for the screening and evaluation of bipolar disorder exist , including the bipolar spectrum diagnostic scale , mood disorder questionnaire , the general behavior inventory and the hypomania checklist .
the use of evaluation scales cannot substitute a full clinical interview but they serve to systematize the recollection of symptoms .
on the other hand , instruments for screening bipolar disorder tend to have lower sensitivity .
there are several other mental disorders with symptoms similar to those seen in bipolar disorder .
these disorders include schizophrenia , major depressive disorder , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ) , and certain personality disorders , such as borderline personality disorder .
although there are no biological tests that are diagnostic of bipolar disorder , blood tests and / or imaging may be carried out to exclude medical illnesses with clinical presentations similar to that of bipolar disorder .
neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis , complex partial seizures , strokes , brain tumors , wilson's disease , traumatic brain injury , huntington's disease , and complex migraines can mimic features of bipolar disorder .
an eeg may be used to exclude neurological disorders such as epilepsy , and a ct scan or mri of the head may be used to exclude brain lesions .
additionally , disorders of the endocrine system such as hypothyroidism , hyperthyroidism , and cushing's disease are in the differential as is the connective tissue disease systemic lupus erythematosus .
infectious causes of mania that may appear similar to bipolar mania include herpes encephalitis , hiv , influenza , or neurosyphilis .
certain vitamin deficiencies such as pellagra ( niacin deficiency ) , vitamin b12 deficiency , folate deficiency , and wernicke korsakoff syndrome ( thiamine deficiency ) can also lead to mania .
a review of current and recent medications and drug use is considered to rule out these causes ; common medications that can cause manic symptoms include antidepressants , prednisone , parkinson's disease medications , thyroid hormone , stimulants ( including cocaine and methamphetamine ) , and certain antibiotics .
bipolar spectrum disorders includes : bipolar i disorder , bipolar ii disorder , cyclothymic disorder and cases where subthreshold symptoms are found to cause clinically significant impairment or distress .
these disorders involve major depressive episodes that alternate with manic or hypomanic episodes , or with mixed episodes that feature symptoms of both mood states .
the concept of the bipolar spectrum is similar to that of emil kraepelin's original concept of manic depressive illness .
unipolar hypomania without accompanying depression has been noted in the medical literature .
there is speculation as to whether this condition may occur with greater frequency in the general , untreated population ; successful social function of these potentially high-achieving individuals may lead to being labeled as normal , rather than as individuals with substantial dysregulation .
the dsm and the icd characterize bipolar disorder as a spectrum of disorders occurring on a continuum .
the dsm-5 lists three specific subtypes : when relevant , specifiers for " peripartum onset " and " with rapid cycling " should be used with any subtype .
individuals who have subthreshold symptoms that cause clinically significant distress or impairment , but do not meet full criteria for one of the three subtypes may be diagnosed with other specified or unspecified bipolar disorder .
other specified bipolar disorder is used when a clinician chooses to provide an explanation for why the full criteria were not met ( e .
g .
, hypomania without a prior major depressive episode ) .
most people who meet criteria for bipolar disorder experience a number of episodes , on average *num* .
*num* to *num* .
*num* per year , lasting three to six months .
" rapid cycling " , however , is a course specifier that may be applied to any of the above subtypes .
it is defined as having four or more mood disturbance episodes within a one-year span and is found in a significant proportion of individuals with bipolar disorder .
these episodes are separated from each other by a remission ( partial or full ) for at least two months or a switch in mood polarity ( i .
e .
, from a depressive episode to a manic episode or vice versa ) .
the definition of rapid cycling most frequently cited in the literature ( including the dsm ) is that of dunner and fieve : at least four major depressive , manic , hypomanic or mixed episodes are required to have occurred during a *ord* period .
ultra-rapid ( days ) and ultra-ultra rapid or ultradian ( within a day ) cycling have also been described .
the literature examining the pharmacological treatment of rapid cycling is sparse and there is no clear consensus with respect to its optimal pharmacological management .
attempts at prevention of bipolar disorder have focused on stress ( such as childhood adversity or highly conflictual families ) which , although not a diagnostically specific causal agent for bipolar , does place genetically and biologically vulnerable individuals at risk for a more severe course of illness .
there has been debate regarding the causal relationship between usage of cannabis and bipolar disorder .
there are a number of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic techniques used to treat bipolar disorder .
individuals may use self-help and pursue recovery .
hospitalization may be required especially with the manic episodes present in bipolar i .
this can be voluntary or ( local legislation permitting ) involuntary ( called civil or involuntary commitment ) .
long-term inpatient stays are now less common due to deinstitutionalization , although these can still occur .
following ( or in lieu of ) a hospital admission , support services available can include drop-in centers , visits from members of a community mental health team or an assertive community treatment team , supported employment and patient-led support groups , intensive outpatient programs .
these are sometimes referred to as partial-inpatient programs .
psychotherapy is aimed at alleviating core symptoms , recognizing episode triggers , reducing negative expressed emotion in relationships , recognizing prodromal symptoms before full-blown recurrence , and , practicing the factors that lead to maintenance of remission .
cognitive behavioral therapy , family-focused therapy , and psychoeducation have the most evidence for efficacy in regard to relapse prevention , while interpersonal and social rhythm therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy appear the most effective in regard to residual depressive symptoms .
most studies have been based only on bipolar i , however , and treatment during the acute phase can be a particular challenge .
some clinicians emphasize the need to talk with individuals experiencing mania , to develop a therapeutic alliance in support of recovery .
a number of medications are used to treat bipolar disorder .
the medication with the best evidence is lithium , which is an effective treatment for acute manic episodes , preventing relapses , and bipolar depression .
lithium reduces the risk of suicide , self-harm , and death in people with bipolar disorder .
it is unclear if ketamine ( a common general anaesthetic used in surgery ) is useful in bipolar .
lithium and the anticonvulsants carbamazepine , lamotrigine , and valproic acid are used as mood stabilizers to treat bipolar disorder .
these mood stabilizers are used for long-term mood stabilization but have not demonstrated the ability to quickly treat acute bipolar depression .
lithium is preferred for long-term mood stabilization .
carbamazepine effectively treats manic episodes , with some evidence it has greater benefit in rapid-cycling bipolar disorder , or those with more psychotic symptoms or a more schizoaffective clinical picture .
it is less effective in preventing relapse than lithium or valproate .
valproate has become a commonly prescribed treatment and effectively treats manic episodes .
lamotrigine has some efficacy in treating bipolar depression , and this benefit is greatest in more severe depression .
it has also been shown to have some benefit in preventing bipolar disorder relapses , though there are concerns about the studies done , and is of no benefit in rapid cycling subtype of bipolar disorder .
the effectiveness of topiramate is unknown .
antipsychotic medications are effective for short-term treatment of bipolar manic episodes and appear to be superior to lithium and anticonvulsants for this purpose .
atypical antipsychotics are also indicated for bipolar depression refractory to treatment with mood stabilizers .
olanzapine is effective in preventing relapses , although the supporting evidence is weaker than the evidence for lithium .
antidepressants are not recommended for use alone in the treatment of bipolar disorder and have not been found to be of any benefit over that found with mood stabilizers .
atypical antipsychotic medications ( e .
g .
, aripiprazole ) are preferred over antidepressants to augment the effects of mood stabilizers due to the lack of efficacy of antidepressants in bipolar disorder .
short courses of benzodiazepines may be used in addition to other medications until mood stabilizing become effective .
electroconvulsive therapy ( ect ) is an effective form of treatment for acute mood disturbances in those with bipolar disorder , especially when psychotic or catatonic features are displayed .
ect is also recommended for use in pregnant women with bipolar disorder .
contrary to widely held views , stimulants are relatively safe in bipolar disorder , and considerable evidence suggests they may even produce an antimanic effect .
in cases of comorbid adhd and bipolar , stimulants may help improve both conditions .
several studies have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids may have beneficial effects on depressive symptoms , but not manic symptoms .
however , only a few small studies of variable quality have been published and there is not enough evidence to draw any firm conclusions .
a lifelong condition with periods of partial or full recovery in between recurrent episodes of relapse , bipolar disorder is considered to be a major health problem worldwide because of the increased rates of disability and premature mortality .
it is also associated with co-occurring psychiatric and medical problems , and high rates of initial under- or misdiagnosis , causing a delay in appropriate treatment interventions and contributing to poorer prognoses .
after a diagnosis is made , it remains difficult to achieve complete remission of all symptoms with the currently available psychiatric medications and symptoms often become progressively more severe over time .
compliance with medications is one of the most significant factors that can decrease the rate and severity of relapse and have a positive impact on overall prognosis .
however , the types of medications used in treating bd commonly cause side effects and more than *num* % of individuals with bd inconsistently take their medications for various reasons .
of the various types of the disorder , rapid cycling ( four or more episodes in one year ) is associated with the worst prognosis due to higher rates of self-harm and suicide .
individuals diagnosed with bipolar who have a family history of bipolar disorder are at a greater risk for more frequent manic / hypomanic episodes .
early onset and psychotic features are also associated with worse outcomes , as well as subtypes that are nonresponsive to lithium .
early recognition and intervention also improve prognosis as the symptoms in earlier stages are less severe and more responsive to treatment .
onset after adolescence is connected to better prognoses for both genders , and being male is a protective factor against higher levels of depression .
for women , better social functioning prior to developing bipolar disorder and being a parent are protective towards suicide attempts .
people with bipolar disorder often experience a decline in cognitive functioning during ( or possibly before ) their first episode , after which a certain degree of cognitive dysfunction typically becomes permanent , with more severe impairment during acute phases and moderate impairment during periods of remission .
as a result , two-thirds of people with bd continue to experience impaired psychosocial functioning in between episodes even when their mood symptoms are in full remission .
a similar pattern is seen in both bd-i and bd-ii , but people with bd-ii experience a lesser degree of impairment .
cognitive deficits typically increase over the course of the illness .
higher degrees of impairment correlate with the number of previous manic episodes and hospitalizations , and with the presence of psychotic symptoms .
early intervention can slow the progression of cognitive impairment , while treatment at later stages can help reduce distress and negative consequences related to cognitive dysfunction .
despite the overly ambitious goals that are frequently part of manic episodes , symptoms of mania undermine the ability to achieve these goals and often interfere with an individual's social and occupational functioning .
one third of people with bd remain unemployed for one year following a hospitalization for mania .
depressive symptoms during and between episodes , which occur much more frequently for most people than hypomanic or manic symptoms over the course of illness , are associated with lower functional recovery in between episodes , including unemployment or underemployment for both bd-i and bd-ii .
however , the course of illness ( duration , age of onset , number of hospitalizations , and presence or not of rapid cycling ) and cognitive performance are the best predictors of employment outcomes in individuals with bipolar disorder , followed by symptoms of depression and years of education .
a naturalistic study from first admission for mania or mixed episode ( representing the hospitalized and therefore most severe cases ) found that *num* percent achieved syndromal recovery ( no longer meeting criteria for the diagnosis ) within six weeks and *num* percent within two years .
within two years , *num* percent achieved symptomatic recovery ( no symptoms at all ) and *num* percent achieved functional recovery ( regaining of prior occupational and residential status ) .
however , *num* percent went on to experience a new episode of mania or depression within *num* years of syndromal recovery , and *num* percent switched phases without recovery .
symptoms preceding a relapse ( prodromal ) , specially those related to mania , can be reliably identified by people with bipolar disorder .
there have been intents to teach patients coping strategies when noticing such symptoms with encouraging results .
bipolar disorder can cause suicidal ideation that leads to suicidal attempts .
individuals whose bipolar disorder begins with a depressive or mixed affective episode seem to have a poorer prognosis and an increased risk of suicide .
one out of two people with bipolar disorder attempt suicide at least once during their lifetime and many attempts are successfully completed .
the annual average suicide rate is *num* .
*num* percent , which is 10–20 times that of the general population .
the standardized mortality ratio from suicide in bipolar disorder is between *num* and *num* .
the lifetime risk of suicide has been estimated to be as high as *num* percent in those with bipolar disorder .
bipolar disorder is the sixth leading cause of disability worldwide and has a lifetime prevalence of about *num* to *num* percent in the general population .
however , a reanalysis of data from the national epidemiological catchment area survey in the united states suggested that *num* .
*num* percent of the population experience a manic episode at least once ( the diagnostic threshold for bipolar i ) and a further *num* .
*num* percent have a hypomanic episode ( the diagnostic threshold for bipolar ii or cyclothymia ) .
including sub-threshold diagnostic criteria , such as one or two symptoms over a short time-period , an additional *num* .
*num* percent of the population , adding up to a total of *num* .
*num* percent , were classified as having a bipolar spectrum disorder .
a more recent analysis of data from a second us national comorbidity survey found that *num* percent met lifetime prevalence criteria for bipolar i , *num* .
*num* percent for bipolar ii , and *num* .
*num* percent for subthreshold symptoms .
there are conceptual and methodological limitations and variations in the findings .
prevalence studies of bipolar disorder are typically carried out by lay interviewers who follow fully structured / fixed interview schemes ; responses to single items from such interviews may suffer limited validity .
in addition , diagnoses ( and therefore estimates of prevalence ) vary depending on whether a categorical or spectrum approach is used .
this consideration has led to concerns about the potential for both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis .
the incidence of bipolar disorder is similar in men and women as well as across different cultures and ethnic groups .
a *num* study by the world health organization found that prevalence and incidence of bipolar disorder are very similar across the world .

however , severity may differ widely across the globe .
disability-adjusted life year rates , for example , appear to be higher in developing countries , where medical coverage may be poorer and medication less available .
within the united states , asian americans have significantly lower rates than their african and european american counterparts .
late adolescence and early adulthood are peak years for the onset of bipolar disorder .
one study also found that in *num* percent of bipolar cases , the onset of mania had happened after the patient had turned *num* .
variations in moods and energy levels have been observed as part of the human experience throughout history .
the words " melancholia " , an old word for depression , and " mania " originated in ancient greece .
the word melancholia is derived from " melas " ( ) , meaning " black " , and " chole " ( ) , meaning " bile " or " gall " , indicative of the term's origins in pre-hippocratic humoral theory .
within the humoral theories , mania was viewed as arising from an excess of yellow bile , or a mixture of black and yellow bile .
the linguistic origins of mania , however , are not so clear-cut .
several etymologies were proposed by the ancient roman physician caelius aurelianus , including the greek word " ania " , meaning " to produce great mental anguish " , and " manos " , meaning " relaxed " or " loose " , which would contextually approximate to an excessive relaxing of the mind or soul .
there are at least five other candidates , and part of the confusion surrounding the exact etymology of the word mania is its varied usage in the pre-hippocratic poetry and mythology .
in the early 1800s , french psychiatrist jean-étienne dominique esquirol's lypemania , one of his affective monomanias , was the first elaboration on what was to become modern depression .
the basis of the current conceptualisation of bipolar illness can be traced back to the 1850s ; in *num* , jean-pierre falret presented a description to the academy the paris psychiatric society in the course of which he mentioned " circular insanity " ( la folie circulaire , ) ; the lecture was summarized in *num* in the " gazette des hôpitaux " ( " hospital gazette " ) .
three years later , in *num* , jules-gabriel-françois baillarger ( 1809–1890 ) described to the french imperial académie nationale de médecine a biphasic mental illness causing recurrent oscillations between mania and melancholia , which he termed " folie à double forme " ( , " madness in double form " ) .
baillarger's original paper , " de la folie à double forme , " appeared in the medical journal annales médico-psychologiques ( medico-psychological annals ) in *num* .
these concepts were developed by the german psychiatrist emil kraepelin ( 1856–1926 ) , who , using kahlbaum's concept of cyclothymia , categorized and studied the natural course of untreated bipolar patients .
he coined the term " manic depressive psychosis " , after noting that periods of acute illness , manic or depressive , were generally punctuated by relatively symptom-free intervals where the patient was able to function normally .
the term " manic–depressive " reaction" " appeared in the first version of the dsm in *num* , influenced by the legacy of adolf meyer .
subtyping into " unipolar " depressive disorders and bipolar disorders has its origin in karl kleist's concept - since *num* - of unipolar and bipolar affective disorders , which was used by karl leonhard in *num* to differentiate between unipolar and bipolar disorder in depression .
these subtypes have been regarded as separate conditions since publication of the dsm-iii .
the subtypes bipolar ii and rapid cycling have been included since the dsm-iv , based on work from the 1970s by david dunner , elliot gershon , frederick goodwin , ronald fieve , and joseph fleiss .
there are widespread problems with social stigma , stereotypes , and prejudice against individuals with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder .
kay redfield jamison , a clinical psychologist and professor of psychiatry at the johns hopkins university school of medicine , profiled her own bipolar disorder in her memoir " an unquiet mind " ( *num* ) .
in his autobiography " " ( *num* ) , chris joseph describes his struggle between the creative dynamism which allowed the creation of his multimillion-pound advertising agency hook advertising , and the money-squandering dark despair of his bipolar illness .
several dramatic works have portrayed characters with traits suggestive of the diagnosis that has been the subject of discussion by psychiatrists and film experts alike .
a notable example is " mr .
jones " ( *num* ) , in which mr .
jones ( richard gere ) swings from a manic episode into a depressive phase and back again , spending time in a psychiatric hospital and displaying many of the features of the syndrome .
in " the mosquito coast " ( *num* ) , allie fox ( harrison ford ) displays some features including recklessness , grandiosity , increased goal-directed activity and mood lability , as well as some paranoia .
psychiatrists have suggested that willy loman , the main character in arthur miller's classic play " death of a salesman " , suffers from bipolar disorder , though that specific term for the condition did not exist when the play was written .
tv specials , for example the bbc's " " , mtv's " true life : i'm bipolar " , talk shows , and public radio shows , and the greater willingness of public figures to discuss their own bipolar disorder , have focused on psychiatric conditions , thereby , raising public awareness .
on april *num* , *num* , the nighttime drama " *num* " on the cw network , aired a special episode where the character silver was diagnosed with bipolar disorder .
stacey slater , a character from the bbc soap eastenders , has been diagnosed with the disorder .
the storyline was developed as part of the bbc's headroom campaign .
the channel *num* soap " brookside " had earlier featured a story about bipolar disorder when the character jimmy corkhill was diagnosed with the condition .
*num* showtime's political thriller drama " homeland " protagonist carrie mathison is bipolar , which she has kept secret since her school days .
in april *num* , abc premiered a medical drama , " black box " , in which the main character , a world-renowned neuroscientist , is bipolar .
a link between mental illness and professional success or creativity has been suggested , including in accounts by socrates , seneca the younger , and cesare lombroso .
despite prominence in popular culture , the link between creativity and bipolar has not been rigorously studied .
this area of study also is likely affected by confirmation bias .
some evidence suggests that some heritable component of bipolar disorder overlaps with heritable components of creativity .
probands of people with bipolar disorder are more likely to be professionally successful , as well as to demonstrate temperamental traits similar to bipolar disorder .
furthermore , while studies of the frequency of bipolar disorder in creative population samples have been conflicting , studies that have a positive finding report that full blown bipolar disorder is rare .
in the 1920s , emil kraepelin noted that manic episodes are rare before puberty .
in general , bipolar disorder in children was not recognized in the first half of the twentieth century .
this issue diminished with an increased following of the dsm criteria in the last part of the twentieth century .
the dsm5 does not specifically have bipolar disorder in children and instead refers to it as disruptive mood dysregulation disorder .
while in adults the course of bipolar disorder is characterized by discrete episodes of depression and mania with no clear symptomatology between them , in children and adolescents very fast mood changes or even chronic symptoms are the norm .
pediatric bipolar disorder is commonly characterized by outbursts of anger , irritability and psychosis , rather than euphoric mania , which is more likely to be seen in adults .
early onset bipolar disorder is more likely to manifest as depression rather than mania or hypomania .
the diagnosis of childhood bipolar disorder is controversial , although it is not under discussion that the typical symptoms of bipolar disorder have negative consequences for minors suffering them .
the debate is mainly centered on whether what is called bipolar disorder in children refers to the same disorder as when diagnosing adults , and the related question of whether the criteria for diagnosis for adults are useful and accurate when applied to children .
regarding diagnosis of children , some experts recommend following the dsm criteria .
others believe that these criteria do not correctly separate children with bipolar disorder from other problems such as adhd , and emphasize fast mood cycles .
still others argue that what accurately differentiates children with bipolar disorder is irritability .
the practice parameters of the aacap encourage the first strategy .
american children and adolescents diagnosed with bipolar disorder in community hospitals increased 4-fold reaching rates of up to *num* percent in *num* years around the beginning of the *ord* century , while in outpatient clinics it doubled reaching *num* percent .
studies using dsm criteria show that up to *num* percent of youth may have bipolar disorder .
treatment involves medication and psychotherapy .
drug prescription usually consists in mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics .
among the former , lithium is the only compound approved by the fda for children .
psychological treatment combines normally education on the disease , group therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy .
chronic medication is often needed .
current research directions for bipolar disorder in children include optimizing treatments , increasing the knowledge of the genetic and neurobiological basis of the pediatric disorder and improving diagnostic criteria .
some treatment research suggests that psychosocial interventions that involve the family , psychoeducation , and skills building ( through therapies such as cbt , dbt , and ipsrt ) can benefit in a pharmocotherapy .
unfortunately , the literature and research on the effects of psychosocial therapy on bpsd is scarce , making it difficult to determine the efficacy of various therapies .
the dsm-5 has proposed a new diagnosis which is considered to cover some presentations currently thought of as childhood-onset bipolar .
there is a relative lack of knowledge about bipolar disorder in late life .
there is evidence that it becomes less prevalent with age but nevertheless accounts for a similar percentage of psychiatric admissions ; that older bipolar patients had first experienced symptoms at a later age ; that later onset of mania is associated with more neurologic impairment ; that substance abuse is considerably less common in older groups ; and that there is probably a greater degree of variation in presentation and course , for instance individuals may develop new-onset mania associated with vascular changes , or become manic only after recurrent depressive episodes , or may have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at an early age and still meet criteria .
there is also some weak and not conclusive evidence that mania is less intense and there is a higher prevalence of mixed episodes , although there may be a reduced response to treatment .
overall , there are likely more similarities than differences from younger adults .
in the elderly , recognition and treatment of bipolar disorder may be complicated by the presence of dementia or the side effects of medications being taken for other conditions .
agnosticism agnosticism is the view that the existence of god , of the divine or the supernatural is unknown or unknowable .
the english biologist thomas henry huxley coined the word " agnostic " in *num* , and said " it simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe .
" earlier thinkers , however , had written works that promoted agnostic points of view , such as sanjaya belatthaputta , a 5th-century bce indian philosopher who expressed agnosticism about any afterlife ; and protagoras , a 5th-century bce greek philosopher who expressed agnosticism about the existence of " the gods " .
the nasadiya sukta in the rigveda is agnostic about the origin of the universe .
according to the philosopher william l .
rowe , " agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that god exists or the belief that god does not exist " .
agnosticism is the doctrine or tenet of agnostics with regard to the existence of anything beyond and behind material phenomena or to knowledge of a first cause or god , and is not a religion .
being a scientist , above all else , huxley presented agnosticism as a form of demarcation .
a hypothesis with no supporting , objective , testable evidence is not an objective , scientific claim .
as such , there would be no way to test said hypotheses , leaving the results inconclusive .
his agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth , or falsehood , of the claim at hand .
karl popper would also describe himself as an agnostic .
according to philosopher william l .
rowe , in this strict sense , agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that god exists or the belief that god does not exist .
george h .
smith , while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word , and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word , promoted broadening the definition of atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic .
smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism ( the view of those who do not " believe " in the existence of any deity , but do not claim to " know " if a deity does or does not exist ) and agnostic theism ( the view of those who do not claim to " know " of the existence of any deity , but still " believe " in such an existence ) .
"agnostic " ( ) was used by thomas henry huxley in a speech at a meeting of the metaphysical society in *num* to describe his philosophy , which rejects all claims of spiritual or mystical knowledge .
early christian church leaders used the greek word " gnosis " ( knowledge ) to describe " spiritual knowledge " .
agnosticism is not to be confused with religious views opposing the ancient religious movement of gnosticism in particular ; huxley used the term in a broader , more abstract sense .
huxley identified agnosticism not as a creed but rather as a method of skeptical , evidence-based inquiry .
in recent years , scientific literature dealing with neuroscience and psychology has used the word to mean " not knowable " .
in technical and marketing literature , " agnostic " can also mean independence from some parameters—for example , " platform agnostic" or " hardware agnostic " .
scottish enlightenment philosopher david hume contended that meaningful statements about the universe are always qualified by some degree of doubt .
he asserted that the fallibility of human beings means that they cannot obtain absolute certainty except in trivial cases where a statement is true by definition ( e .
g .
tautologies such as " all bachelors are unmarried " or " all triangles have three corners " ) .
throughout the history of hinduism there has been a strong tradition of philosophic speculation and skepticism .
the rig veda takes an agnostic view on the fundamental question of how the universe and the gods were created .
nasadiya sukta ( " creation hymn " ) in the tenth chapter of the rig veda says : aristotle , anselm , aquinas , and descartes presented arguments attempting to rationally prove the existence of god .
the skeptical empiricism of david hume , the antinomies of immanuel kant , and the existential philosophy of søren kierkegaard convinced many later philosophers to abandon these attempts , regarding it impossible to construct any unassailable proof for the existence or non-existence of god .
in his *num* book , " philosophical fragments " , kierkegaard writes : hume was huxley's favourite philosopher , calling him " the prince of agnostics " .
diderot wrote to his mistress , telling of a visit by hume to the baron d'holbach , and describing how a word for the position that huxley would later describe as agnosticism didn't seem to exist , or at least wasn't common knowledge , at the time .
raised in a religious environment , charles darwin ( 1809-1882 ) studied to be an anglican clergyman .
while eventually doubting parts of his faith , darwin continued to help in church affairs , even while avoiding church attendance .
darwin stated that it would be " absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist " .
although reticent about his religious views , in *num* he wrote that " i have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a god .
– i think that generally .
.
.
an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind .
" agnostic views are as old as philosophical skepticism , but the terms agnostic and agnosticism were created by huxley ( 1825-1895 ) to sum up his thoughts on contemporary developments of metaphysics about the " unconditioned " ( william hamilton ) and the " unknowable " ( herbert spencer ) .
though huxley began to use the term " agnostic " in *num* , his opinions had taken shape some time before that date .
in a letter of september *num* , *num* , to charles kingsley , huxley discussed his views extensively : and again , to the same correspondent , may *num* , *num* : of the origin of the name agnostic to describe this attitude , huxley gave the following account : in *num* , huxley wrote : therefore , although it be , as i believe , demonstrable that we have no real knowledge of the authorship , or of the date of composition of the gospels , as they have come down to us , and that nothing better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject .
william stewart ross ( 1844-1906 ) wrote under the name of saladin .
he was associated with victorian freethinkers and the organization the british secular union .
he edited the " secular review " from *num* ; it was renamed " agnostic journal and eclectic review " and closed in *num* .
ross championed agnosticism in opposition to the atheism of charles bradlaugh as an open-ended spiritual exploration .
in " why i am an agnostic " ( c .
*num* ) he claims that agnosticism is " the very reverse of atheism " .
bertrand russell ( 1872-1970 ) declared " why i am not a christian " in *num* , a classic statement of agnosticism .
he calls upon his readers to " stand on their own two feet and look fair and square at the world with a fearless attitude and a free intelligence " .
in *num* , russell gave a lecture on " the existence and nature of god " , in which he characterized himself as an atheist .
he said : however , later in the same lecture , discussing modern non-anthropomorphic concepts of god , russell states : in russell's *num* pamphlet , " am i an atheist or an agnostic ? " ( subtitled " a plea for tolerance in the face of new dogmas " ) , he ruminates on the problem of what to call himself : in his *num* essay , " what is an agnostic ? " russell states : later in the essay , russell adds : in *num* christian theologian leslie weatherhead ( 1893–1976 ) published " the christian agnostic " , in which he argues : although radical and unpalatable to conventional theologians , weatherhead's " agnosticism " falls far short of huxley's , and short even of " weak agnosticism " : robert g .
ingersoll ( 1833-1899 ) , an illinois lawyer and politician who evolved into a well-known and sought-after orator in 19th-century america , has been referred to as the " great agnostic " .
in an *num* lecture titled " why i am an agnostic " , ingersoll related why he was an agnostic : in the conclusion of the speech he simply sums up the agnostic position as : in *num* ingersoll explained his comparative view of agnosticism and atheism as follows : canon bernard iddings bell ( 1886-1958 ) , a popular cultural commentator , episcopal priest , and author , lauded the necessity of agnosticism in " beyond agnosticism : a book for tired mechanists " , calling it the foundation of " all intelligent christianity .
" agnosticism was a temporary mindset in which one rigorously questioned the truths of the age , including the way in which one believed god .
his view of robert ingersoll and thomas paine was that they were not denouncing true christianity but rather " a gross perversion of it .
" part of the misunderstanding stemmed from ignorance of the concepts of god and religion .
historically , a god was any real , perceivable force that ruled the lives of humans and inspired admiration , love , fear , and homage ; religion was the practice of it .
ancient peoples worshiped gods with real counterparts , such as mammon ( money and material things ) , nabu ( rationality ) , or ba'al ( violent weather ) ; bell argued that modern peoples were still paying homage—with their lives and their children's lives—to these old gods of wealth , physical appetites , and self-deification .
thus , if one attempted to be agnostic passively , he or she would incidentally join the worship of the world's gods .
in " unfashionable convictions ( *num* ) , " he criticized the enlightenment's complete faith in human sensory perception , augmented by scientific instruments , as a means of accurately grasping reality .
firstly , it was fairly new , an innovation of the western world , which aristotle invented and thomas aquinas revived among the scientific community .
secondly , the divorce of " pure " science from human experience , as manifested in american industrialization , had completely altered the environment , often disfiguring it , so as to suggest its insufficiency to human needs .
thirdly , because scientists were constantly producing more data—to the point where no single human could grasp it all at once—it followed that human intelligence was incapable of attaining a complete understanding of universe ; therefore , to admit the mysteries of the unobserved universe was to be " actually " scientific .
bell believed that there were two other ways that humans could perceive and interact with the world .
" artistic experience " was how one expressed meaning through speaking , writing , painting , gesturing—any sort of communication which shared insight into a human's inner reality .
" mystical experience " was how one could " read " people and harmonize with them , being what we commonly call love .
in summary , man was a scientist , artist , and lover .
without exercising all three , a person became " lopsided .
" bell considered a humanist to be a person who cannot rightly ignore the other ways of knowing .
however , humanism , like agnosticism , was also temporal , and would eventually lead to either scientific materialism or theism .
thus , he lays out the following thesis : demographic research services normally do not differentiate between various types of non-religious respondents , so agnostics are often classified in the same category as atheists or other non-religious people .
a *num* survey published in " encyclopædia britannica " found that the non-religious people or the agnostics made up about *num* .
*num* % of the world's population .
a november–december *num* poll published in the " financial times " gives rates for the united states and five european countries .
the rates of agnosticism in the united states were at *num* % , while the rates of agnosticism in the european countries surveyed were considerably higher : italy ( *num* % ) , spain ( *num* % ) , great britain ( *num* % ) , germany ( *num* % ) , and france ( *num* % ) .
a study conducted by the pew research center found that about *num* % of the world's people , the third largest group after christianity and islam , have no religious affiliation .
according to a *num* report by the pew research center , agnostics made up *num* .
*num* % of the us adult population .
in the " u .
s .
religious landscape survey " , conducted by the pew research center , *num* % of agnostic respondents expressed " a belief in god or a universal spirit " , whereas *num* % stated that they thought that they felt a tension " being non-religious in a society where most people are religious " .
according to the *num* australian bureau of statistics , *num* % of australians have " no religion " , a category that includes agnostics .
between *num* % and *num* % of japanese and up to *num* % of vietnamese are atheists , agnostics , or do not believe in a god .
an official european union survey reported that *num* % of the eu population is unsure about their belief in a god or spirit .
agnosticism is criticized from a variety of standpoints .
some religious thinkers see agnosticism as limiting the mind's capacity to know reality to materialism .
some atheists criticize the use of the term agnosticism as functionally indistinguishable from atheism ; this results in frequent criticisms of those who adopt the term as avoiding the atheist label .
theistic critics claim that agnosticism is impossible in practice , since a person can live only either as if god did not exist ( " etsi deus non-daretur " ) , or as if god did exist ( " etsi deus daretur " ) .
religious scholars such as laurence b .
brown criticize the misuse of the word agnosticism , claiming that it has become one of the most misapplied terms in metaphysics .
brown raises the question , " you claim that nothing can be known with certainty .
.
.
how , then , can you be so sure ? " according to pope benedict xvi , strong agnosticism in particular contradicts itself in affirming the power of reason to know scientific truth .
he blames the exclusion of reasoning from religion and ethics for dangerous pathologies such as crimes against humanity and ecological disasters .
"agnosticism " , said ratzinger , " is always the fruit of a refusal of that knowledge which is in fact offered to man .
.
.
the knowledge of god has always existed " .
he asserted that agnosticism is a choice of comfort , pride , dominion , and utility over truth , and is opposed by the following attitudes : the keenest self-criticism , humble listening to the whole of existence , the persistent patience and self-correction of the scientific method , a readiness to be purified by the truth .
the catholic church sees merit in examining what it calls " partial agnosticism " , specifically those systems that " do not aim at constructing a complete philosophy of the unknowable , but at excluding special kinds of truth , notably religious , from the domain of knowledge " .
however , the church is historically opposed to a full denial of the capacity of human reason to know god .
the council of the vatican declares , " god , the beginning and end of all , can , by the natural light of human reason , be known with certainty from the works of creation " .
blaise pascal argued that even if there were truly no evidence for god , agnostics should consider what is now known as pascal's wager : the infinite expected value of acknowledging god is always greater than the finite expected value of not acknowledging his existence , and thus it is a safer " bet " to choose god .
peter kreeft and ronald tacelli cited *num* arguments for god's existence , asserting that any demand for evidence testable in a laboratory is in effect asking god , the supreme being , to become man's servant .
according to richard dawkins , a distinction between agnosticism and atheism is unwieldy and depends on how close to zero a person is willing to rate the probability of existence for any given god-like entity .
about himself , dawkins continues , " i am agnostic only to the extent that i am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden .
" dawkins also identifies two categories of agnostics ; " temporary agnostics in practice " ( taps ) , and " permanent agnostics in principle " ( paps ) .
he states that " agnosticism about the existence of god belongs firmly in the temporary or tap category .
either he exists or he doesn't .
it is a scientific question ; one day we may know the answer , and meanwhile we can say something pretty strong about the probability .
" , and considers pap a " deeply inescapable kind of fence-sitting " .
a related concept is ignosticism , the view that a coherent definition of a deity must be put forward before the question of the existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed .
if the chosen definition is not coherent , the ignostic holds the noncognitivist view that the existence of a deity is meaningless or empirically untestable .
a .
j .
ayer , theodore drange , and other philosophers see both atheism and agnosticism as incompatible with ignosticism on the grounds that atheism and agnosticism accept " a deity exists " as a meaningful proposition that can be argued for or against .
beacon a beacon is an intentionally conspicuous device designed to attract attention to a specific location .
beacons can also be combined with semaphoric or other indicators to provide important information , such as the status of an airport , by the colour and rotational pattern of its airport beacon , or of pending weather as indicated on a weather beacon mounted at the top of a tall building or similar site .
when used in such fashion , beacons can be considered a form of optical telegraphy .
beacons help guide navigators to their destinations .
types of navigational beacons include radar reflectors , radio beacons , sonic and visual signals .
visual beacons range from small , single-pile structures to large lighthouses or light stations and can be located on land or on water .
lighted beacons are called " lights " ; unlighted beacons are called " daybeacons " .
aerodrome beacons are used to indicate locations of airports and helipads .
handheld beacons are also employed in aircraft marshalling , and are used by the marshal to deliver instructions to the crew of aircraft as they move around an active airport , heliport or aircraft carrier .
classically , beacons were fires lit at well-known locations on hills or high places , used either as lighthouses for navigation at sea , or for signalling over land that enemy troops were approaching , in order to alert defenses .
as signals , beacons are an ancient form of optical telegraph and were part of a relay league .
systems of this kind have existed for centuries over much of the world .
the ancient romans used beacons and beacons figure on several occasions on the column of trajan .
in the *ord* century , during the arab–byzantine wars , the byzantine empire used a beacon system to transmit messages from the border with the abbasid caliphate , across anatolia to the imperial palace in the byzantine capital , constantinople .
it was devised by leo the mathematician for emperor theophilos , but either abolished or radically curtailed by theophilos ' son and successor , michael iii .
beacons were later used in greece as well , while the surviving parts of the beacon system in anatolia seem to have been reactivated in the *ord* century by emperor manuel i komnenos .
in scandinavia many hill forts were part of beacon networks to warn against invading pillagers .
in finland , these beacons were called " vainovalkeat " , " persecution fires " , or " vartiotulet " , " guard fires " , and were used to warn finn settlements of imminent raids by the vikings .
in wales , the brecon beacons were named for beacons used to warn of approaching english raiders .
in england , the most famous examples are the beacons used in elizabethan england to warn of the approaching spanish armada .
many hills in england were named beacon hill after such beacons .
in england the authority to erect beacons originally lay wirh the king and later was deligated to the lord high admiral .
the money due for the maintenance of beacons was called " beaconagium " and was levied by the sheriff of each county .
in the scottish borders country , a system of beacon fires was at one time established to warn of incursions by the english .
hume and eggerstone castles and soltra edge were part of this network .
the great wall of china is also a beacon network .
in spain , the border of granada in the territory of the crown of castile had a complex beacon network to warn against moorish raiders and military campaigns .
vehicular beacons are rotating or flashing lights affixed to the top of a vehicle to attract the attention of surrounding vehicles and pedestrians .
emergency vehicles such as fire engines , ambulances , police cars , tow trucks , construction vehicles , and snow-removal vehicles carry beacon lights .
the color of the lamps varies by jurisdiction ; typical colors are blue and / or red for police , fire , and medical-emergency vehicles ; amber for hazards ( slow-moving vehicles , wide loads , tow trucks , security personnel , construction vehicles , etc .
) ; green for volunteer firefighters or for medical personnel , and violet for funerary vehicles .
beacons may be constructed with halogen bulbs similar to those used in vehicle headlamps , xenon flashtubes , or leds .
incandescent and xenon light sources require the vehicle's engine to continue running to ensure that the battery is not depleted when the lights are used for a prolonged period .
the low power consumption of leds allows the vehicle's engine to remain turned off while the lights operate nodes .
beacons and bonfires are also used to mark occasions and celebrate events .
the mishna describes a system of fire beacons used by the high court in jerusalem to communicate the declaration of a new month to jews in israel and babylon .
beacons have also allegedly been abused by shipwreckers .
an illicit fire at a wrong position would be used to direct a ship against shoals or beaches , so that its cargo could be looted after the ship sank or ran aground .
there are , however , no historically substantiated occurrences of such intentional shipwrecking .
in wireless networks , a beacon is a type of frame which is sent by the access point ( or wifi router ) to indicate that it is on .
bluetooth based beacons periodically send out a data packet and this could be used by software to identify the beacon location .
this is typically used by indoor navigation and positioning applications .
"beaconing " is the process that allows a network to self-repair network problems .
the stations on the network notify the other stations on the ring when they are not receiving the transmissions .
beaconing is used in token ring and fddi networks .
in aeschylus ' tragedy " agamemnon " , a chain of eight beacons manned by so-called " lampadóphoroi " inform clytemnestra in argos , within a single night's time , that troy has just fallen under her husband king agamemnon's control , after a famous ten years siege .
in j .
r .
r .
tolkien's high fantasy novel , " the lord of the rings " , a series of beacons alerts the entire realm of gondor when the kingdom is under attack .
these beacon posts were manned by messengers who would carry word of their lighting to either rohan or belfalas .
in peter jackson's , the beacons serve as a connection between the two realms of rohan and gondor , alerting one another directly when they require military aid , as opposed to relying on messengers as in the novel .
beacons are sometimes used in retail to send digital coupons or invites to customers passing by .
arene ( disambiguation ) an aromatic hydrocarbon or arene is a hydrocarbon with alternating double and single bonds between carbon atoms forming rings .
galeazzo alessi galeazzo alessi ( *num* – december *num* , *num* ) was an italian architect from perugia , known throughout europe for his distinctive style based on his enthusiasm for ancient architecture .
he studied drawing for civil and military architecture under the direction of giovanni battista caporali .
for a number of years he lived in genoa .
he was involved in the lay-out of the streets and the restoration of the city walls , as well as being responsible for many of its impressive palazzi , now a part of the world heritage list .
his work can be found in many other italian cities , including in ferrara , bologna , naples and milan , where he designed the facade of santa maria presso san celso .
with vignola , he designed the basilica of santa maria degli angeli in assisi , the seventh largest christian church at the time .
elsewhere in europe , he designed churches and palaces in france , germany and flanders .
he produced designs for el escorial in spain , but age and health prevented him from carrying them out .
andré de longjumeau andré de longjumeau ( also known as andrew of longjumeau in english ) was a 13th-century dominican missionary and diplomat and one of the most active occidental diplomats in the east in the *ord* century .
he led two embassies to the mongols : the first carried letters from pope innocent iv and the second bore gifts and letters from louis ix of france to güyük khan .
well acquainted with the middle-east , he spoke arabic and " chaldean " ( thought to be either syriac or persian ) .
andrew's first mission to the east was when he was asked by the french king louis ix to go and fetch the crown of thorns which had been sold to him by the latin emperor of constantinople baldwin ii in *num* , who was anxious to obtain support for his tottering empire .
andrew was accompanied on this mission by brother jacques .
andrew of longjumeau led one of four missions dispatched to the mongols by pope innocent iv .
he left lyon in the spring of *num* for the levant .
he visited muslim principalities in syria and representatives of the nestorian and jacobite churches in persia , finally delivering the papal correspondence to a mongol general near tabriz .
in tabriz , andré de longjumeau met with a monk from the far east , named simeon rabban ata , who had been put in charge by the khan of protecting the christians in the middle-east .
at the mongol camp near kars andrew had met a certain david , who in december *num* appeared at the court of king louis ix of france in cyprus .
andrew , who was now with saint louis , interpreted david's message to the king , a real or pretended offer of alliance from the mongol general eljigidei , and a proposal of a joint attack upon the islamic powers of syria .
in reply to this the french sovereign dispatched andrew as his ambassador to güyük khan ; with longjumeau went his brother jacques ( also a dominican ) and several others – john goderiche , john of carcassonne , herbert " le sommelier " , gerbert of sens , robert ( a clerk ) , a certain william , and an unnamed clerk of poissy .
the party set out on *num* february *num* , with letters from king louis and the papal legate , and rich presents including a chapel-tent lined with scarlet cloth and embroidered with sacred pictures .
from cyprus they went to the port of antioch in syria , and thence traveled for a year to the khan's court , going ten leagues ( *num* .
*num* kilometers ) per day .
their route led them through persia , along the southern and eastern shores of the caspian sea , and certainly through talas , north-east of tashkent .
on arrival at the supreme mongol court – either that on the imyl river ( near lake alakol and the present russo-chinese frontier in the altai ) , or more probably at or near karakorum itself , south-west of lake baikal – andrew found güyük khan dead , poisoned , as the envoy supposed , by batu khan's agents .
the regent-mother oghul qaimish ( the " camus " of william of rubruck ) seems to have received and dismissed him with presents and a dismissive letter for louis ix .
but it is certain that before the friar had left " tartary " , möngke , güyük's successor , had been elected .
andrew's report to his sovereign , whom he rejoined in *num* at caesarea in palestine , appears to have been a mixture of history and fable ; the latter affects his narrative of the mongols ' rise to greatness , and the struggles of their leader genghis khan with prester john ; it is still more evident in the position assigned to the mongols ' homeland , close to the prison of gog and magog .
on the other hand , the envoy's account of mongol customs is fairly accurate , and his statements about mongol christianity and its prosperity , though perhaps exaggerated ( e .
g .
as to the *num* chapels on wheels in the nomadic host ) are based on fact .
mounds of bones marked his road , witnesses of devastations which other historians record in detail .
he found christian prisoners from germany in the heart of " tartary " ( at talas ) , and was compelled to observe the ceremony of passing between two fires , as a bringer of gifts to a dead khan , gifts which were treated by the mongols as evidence of submission .
this insulting behaviour , and the language of the letter with which andrew reappeared , marked the mission a failure : king louis , says joinville , " "se repenti fort" " ( " felt very sorry " ) .
the date and location of andrew's death is unknown .
we only know of andrew through references in other writers : see especially william of rubruck's in " recueil de voyages " , iv .

backplane a backplane ( or " backplane system " ) is a group of electrical connectors in parallel with each other , so that each pin of each connector is linked to the same relative pin of all the other connectors , forming a computer bus .
it is used as a backbone to connect several printed circuit boards together to make up a complete computer system .
backplanes commonly use a printed circuit board , but wire-wrapped backplanes have also been used in minicomputers and high-reliability applications .
early microcomputer systems like the altair *num* used a backplane for the processor and expansion cards .
a backplane is generally differentiated from a motherboard by the lack of on-board processing and storage elements .
a backplane uses plug-in cards for storage and processing .
backplanes are normally used in preference to cables because of their greater reliability .
in a cabled system , the cables need to be flexed every time that a card is added or removed from the system ; this flexing eventually causes mechanical failures .
a backplane does not suffer from this problem , so its service life is limited only by the longevity of its connectors .
for example , din *num* connectors ( used in the vmebus system ) have three durability grades built to withstand ( respectively ) *num* , *num* and *num* insertions and removals , or " mating cycles " .
to transmit information , serial back-plane technology uses a low-voltage differential signaling transmission method for sending information .
in addition , there are bus expansion cables which will extend a computer bus to an external backplane , usually located in an enclosure , to provide more or different slots than the host computer provides .
these cable sets have a transmitter board located in the computer , an expansion board in the remote backplane , and a cable between the two .
backplanes have grown in complexity from the simple industry standard architecture ( isa ) ( used in the original ibm pc ) or s-100 style where all the connectors were connected to a common bus .
due to limitations inherent in the peripheral component interconnect ( pci ) specification for driving slots , backplanes are now offered as passive and active .
true passive backplanes offer no active bus driving circuitry .
any desired arbitration logic is placed on the daughter cards .
active backplanes include chips which buffer the various signals to the slots .
the distinction between the two isn't always clear , but may become an important issue if a whole system is expected to not have a single point of failure ( spof ) .
a passive backplane , even if it " is " single , is not usually considered a spof .
active backplanes are more complicated and thus have a non-zero risk of malfunction .
when a backplane is used with a plug-in single board computer ( sbc ) or system host board ( shb ) , the combination provides the same functionality as a motherboard , providing processing power , memory , i / o and slots for plug-in cards .
while there are a few motherboards that offer more than *num* slots , that is the traditional limit .
in addition , as technology progresses , the availability and number of a particular slot type may be limited in terms of what is currently offered by motherboard manufacturers .
however , backplane architecture is somewhat unrelated to the sbc technology plugged into it .
there are some limitations to what can be constructed , in that the sbc chip set and processor have to provide the capability of supporting the slot types .
in addition , virtually an unlimited number of slots can be provided with *num* , including the sbc slot , as a practical though not an absolute limit .
thus , a picmg backplane can provide any number and any mix of isa , pci , pci-x , and pci-e slots , limited only by the ability of the sbc to interface to and drive those slots .
for example , an sbc with the latest i7 processor could interface with a backplane providing up to *num* isa slots to drive legacy i / o cards .
some backplanes are constructed with slots for connecting to devices on both sides , and are referred to as midplanes .
this ability to plug cards into either side of a midplane is often useful in larger systems made up primarily of modules attached to the midplane .
midplanes are often used in computers , mostly in blade servers , where server blades reside on one side and the peripheral ( power , networking , and other i / o ) and service modules reside on the other .
midplanes are also popular in networking and telecommunications equipment where one side of the chassis accepts system processing cards and the other side of the chassis accepts network interface cards .
orthogonal midplanes connect vertical cards on one side to horizontal boards on the other side .
one common orthogonal midplane connects many vertical telephone line cards on one side , each one connected to copper telephone wires , to a horizontal communications card on the other side .
a " virtual midplane " is an imaginary plane between vertical cards on one side that directly connect to horizontal boards on the other side ; the card-slot aligners of the card cage and self-aligning connectors on the cards hold the cards in position .
some people use the term " midplane " to describe a board that sits between and connects a hard drive hot-swap backplane and redundant power supplies .
servers commonly have a backplane to attach hot swappable hard drives ; backplane pins pass directly into hard drive sockets without cables .
they may have single connector to connect one disk array controller or multiple connectors that can be connected to one or more controllers in arbitrary way .
backplanes are commonly found in disk enclosures , disk arrays , and servers .
backplanes for sas and sata hdds most commonly use the sgpio protocol as means of communication between the host adapter and the backplane .
alternatively scsi enclosure services can be used .
with parallel scsi subsystems , saf-te is used .
a single-board computer meeting the picmg *num* .

apollos apollos ( ) was a 1st-century alexandrian jewish christian mentioned several times in the new testament .
a contemporary and colleague of paul the apostle , he played an important role in the early development of the churches of ephesus and corinth .
apollos is first mentioned as a christian preacher who had come to ephesus ( probably in ad *num* or *num* ) , where he is described as " being fervent in spirit : he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning jesus , though he knew only the baptism of john " .
priscilla and aquila , a jewish christian couple who had come to ephesus with the apostle paul , instructed apollos : the differences between the two understandings probably related to the christian baptism , since apollos " knew only the baptism of john " .
later , during apollos ' absence , the writer of the acts of the apostles recounts an encounter between paul and some disciples at ephesus : before paul's arrival , apollos had moved from ephesus to achaia and was living in corinth , the provincial capital of achaia .
acts reports that apollos arrived in achaia with a letter of recommendation from the ephesian christians and " greatly helped those who through grace had believed , for he powerfully refuted the jews in public , showing by the scriptures that the christ was jesus .
paul's first epistle to the corinthians ( ad *num* ) mentions apollos as an important figure at corinth .
paul describes apollos ' role at corinth : paul's epistle refers to a schism between four parties in the corinthian church , of which two attached themselves to paul and apollos respectively , using their names ( the third and fourth were peter , identified as cephas , and jesus christ himself ) .
it is possible , though , that , as msgr .
ronald knox suggests , the parties were actually two , one claiming to follow paul , the other claiming to follow apollos .
" it is surely probable that the adherents of st .
paul [ .
.
.
] alleged in defence of his orthodoxy the fact that he was in full agreement with , and in some sense commissioned by , the apostolic college .
hence ' i am for cephas ' .
[ .
.
.
] what reply was the faction of apollos to make ? it devised an expedient which has been imitated by sectaries more than once in later times ; appealed behind the apostolic college itself to him from whom the apostolic college derived its dignity ; ' i am for christ ' .
" paul states that the schism arose because of the corinthians ' immaturity in faith .
apollos was a devout jew born in alexandria .
pope benedict xvi says that the name " apollos " was probably short for apollonius or apollodorus .
apollos ' origin in alexandria has led to speculations that he would have preached in the allegorical style of philo .
theologian jerome murphy-o'connor , for example , commented : " it is difficult to imagine that an alexandrian jew .
.
.
could have escaped the influence of philo , the great intellectual leader .
.
.
particularly since the latter seems to have been especially concerned with education and preaching .
" pope benedict suggest there were those in corinth " .
.
.
fascinated by his way of speaking .
.
.
" there is no indication that apollos favored or approved an overestimation of his person .
paul urged him to go to corinth at the time , but apollos refused , stating that he would come later when he had an opportunity .
apollos is mentioned one more time in the new testament .
in the epistle to titus , the recipient is exhorted to " speed zenas the lawyer and apollos on their way " .
jerome states that apollos was so dissatisfied with the division at corinth that he retired to crete with zenas ; and that once the schism had been healed by paul's letters to the corinthians , apollos returned to the city and became one of its elders .
less probable traditions assign to him the bishopric of duras , or of iconium in phrygia , or of caesarea .
martin luther and some modern scholars have proposed apollos as the author of the epistle to the hebrews , rather than paul or barnabas .
both apollos and barnabas were jewish christians with sufficient intellectual authority .
the pulpit commentary treats apollos ' authorship of hebrews as " generally believed " .
other than this , there are no known surviving texts attributed to apollos .
apollos is regarded as a saint by several christian churches , including the lutheran church–missouri synod , which hold a commemoration for him , together with saints aquila and priscilla , on *num* february .
collectivism collectivism is a cultural value that is characterized by emphasis on cohesiveness among individuals and prioritization of the group over self .
individuals or groups that subscribe to a collectivist worldview tend to find common values and goals as particularly salient and demonstrate greater orientation toward in-group than toward out-group .
the term “in-group” is thought to be more diffusely defined for collectivistic individuals to include societal units ranging from the nuclear family to a religious or racial / ethnic group .
meta-analytic findings support that collectivism shows a consistent association with discrete values , interpersonal patterns of interaction , cognition , perception and self-construal .
collectivism is often discussed alongside the cultural value of individualism , but these are two distinct concepts and are not considered to be opposites .
the german sociologist tönnies described an early model of collectivism and individualism using the terms " gemeinschaft " ( community ) and " gesellschaft " ( society ) .
" gemeinschaft " relationships , in which communalism is prioritized , were thought to be characteristic of small , rural village communities .
an anthropologist , redfield ( *num* ) echoed this notion in work contrasting folk society with urban society .
max weber ( *num* ) contrasted collectivism and individualism through the lens of religion , believing that protestants were more individualistic and self-reliant compared to catholics , who endorsed hierarchical , interdependent relationships among people .
hofstede ( *num* ) was highly influential in ushering in an era of cross-cultural research making comparisons along the dimension of collectivism versus individualism .
hofstede conceptualized collectivism and individualism as part of a single continuum , with each cultural construct representing an opposite pole .
the author characterized individuals that endorsed a high degree of collectivism as being embedded in their social contexts and prioritizing communal goals over individual goals .
the notion that collectivism-individualism is unidimensional has been challenged by contemporary theorists .
collectivism was an important part of marxist–leninist ideology in the soviet union , where it played a key part in forming the new soviet man , willingly sacrificing his or her life for the good of the collective .
terms such as " collective " and " the masses " were frequently used in the official language and praised in agitprop literature , for example by vladimir mayakovsky ( " who needs a " 1" " ) and bertolt brecht ( the decision , man equals man ) .
the construct of collectivism is represented in empirical literature under several different names .
most commonly , the term interdependent self-construal is used .
other phrases used to describe the concept of collectivism-individualism include allocentrism-idiocentrism , collective-private self , as well as subtypes of collectivism-individualism ( meaning , vertical and horizontal subtypes ) .
inconsistent terminology is thought to account for some of the difficulty in effectively synthesizing the empirical literature on collectivism .
typically , collectivism is measured via self-report questionnaire .
meta-analytic findings suggest that there are six instruments that have been used to measure collectivism ( and the related construct of individualism ) in a manner that best reflects current theoretical thinking .
in one critical model of collectivism , markus and kitayama describe the interdependent ( i .
e .
, collectivistic ) self as fundamentally connected to the social context .
as such , one's sense of self depends on and is defined in part by those around them and is primarily manifested in public , overt behavior .
as such , the organization of the self is guided by using others as a reference .
that is , an interdependent individual uses the unexpressed thoughts , feelings , and beliefs of another person with whom they have a relationship with , as well as the other person's behaviors , to make decisions about their own internal attributes and actions .
markus and kitayama also contributed to the literature by challenging hofstede's unidimensional model of collectivism-individualism .
the authors conceptualized these two constructs bidimensionally , such that both collectivism and individualism can be endorsed independently and potentially to the same degree .
this notion has been echoed by other prominent theorists in the field .
some researchers have expanded the collectivism-individualism framework to include a more comprehensive view .
specifically , triandis and colleagues introduced a theoretical model in which incorporates the notion of relational contexts .
the authors argues that the domains of collectivism and individualism can be further described by horizontal and vertical relationships .
horizontal relationships are believed to be status-equal whereas vertical relationships are characterized as hierarchical and status-unequal .
as such , horizontal collectivism is manifested as an orientation in which group harmony is highly valued and in-group members are perceived to experience equal standing .
vertical collectivism involves the prioritization of group goals over individual goals , implying a hierarchical positioning of the self in relation to the overarching in-group .
the horizontal-vertical individualism-collectivism model has received empirical support and has been used to explore patterns within cultures .
originated by w .
e .
b .
dubois , some researchers have adopted a historical perspective on the emergence of collectivism among some cultural groups .
dubois and others argued that oppressed minority groups contend with internal division , meaning that the development of self-identity for individuals from these groups involves the integration of one's own perceptions of their group as well as typically negative , societal views of their group .
this division is thought to impact goal formation such that people from marginalized groups tend to emphasize collectivistic over individualistic values .
some organizational research has found different variations of collectivism .
these include institutional collectivism and in-group collectivism .
institutional collectivism is the idea that a work environment creates a sense of collectivist nature due to similar statuses and similar rewards , such as earning the same salary .
in-group collectivism is the idea that an individual's chosen group of people , such as family or friend groups , create a sense of collectivist nature .
in-group collectivism can be referred to as family collectivism .
a number of classic studies have demonstrated that there is a relationship between collectivism and cognition .
these studies support the notion that people from collectivistic cultures tend to demonstrate a holistic cognitive style , which is reflected in processes such as memory , visual perception , attributional style , and categorization schemas .
this effect has been replicated extensively by independent research groups , supporting its robustness .
an individual's self-concept can be fundamentally shaped by cultural values .
such processes typically begin in childhood and adolescence and parents are often one of the first critical inputs that shape a child's sense of self-concept .
parents with more collectivistic world views have been shown to speak and interact with their children in a manner that conveys the core tenets of collectivism , such as emphasis on the relationships between objects and interpersonal connections .
as such , youth who are parented in this manner tend to develop a sense of self that is defined in relation to others .
this sense of self also has been found to be reflected in patterns of structural and functional connectivity in the brain .
for example , generally the medial prefrontal cortex ( mpfc ) is more active when adults think about themselves compared to when they think about someone else .
however , for adults who endorse collectivism , the mpfc actually shows greater response when they think about themselves in the context of their close relationships .
cultural views are believed to have a reciprocal relationship with macro-level processes such as economics , social change , and politics .
the collectivism-individualism dimension of culture influences economic development : collectivistic culture theoretically promotes growth .
for instance , the influence of the collectivist dimension of culture can be observed among the european union economies : countries which societies are less individualistic record faster economic development , at the expense of individual liberty .
societal changes in china exemplifies this well .
beginning in the early 1980s , china experienced dramatic expansion of economic and social structures , resulting in greater income inequality between families , less involvement of the government in social welfare programs , and increased competition for employment .
corresponding with these changes was a shift in ideology among chinese citizens , especially among those who were younger , away from collectivism ( the prevailing cultural ideology ) toward individualism .
china also saw this shift reflected in educational policies , such that teachers were encouraged to promote the development of their students’ individual opinions and self-efficacy , which prior to the aforementioned economic changes , was not emphasized in chinese culture .
attempts to study the association of collectivism and political views and behaviors has largely occurred at the aggregate national level .
however , more isolated political movements have also adopted a collectivistic framework .
for example , collectivist anarchism ( also known as anarcho-collectivism ) is a revolutionary anarchist doctrine that advocates the abolition of both the state and private ownership of the means of production .
it instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves .
cryptozoology cryptozoology is a pseudoscience and subculture that aims to prove the existence of entities from the folklore record , such as bigfoot , the chupacabra , or mokele-mbembe .
cryptozoologists refer to these entities as " cryptids " , a term coined by the subculture .
because it does not follow the scientific method , cryptozoology is considered a pseudoscience by the academic world : it is neither a branch of zoology nor folkloristics .
it was originally founded in the 1950s by zoologists bernard heuvelmans and ivan t .
sanderson .
scholars have noted that the pseudoscience rejected mainstream approaches from an early date , and that adherents often express hostility to mainstream science .
scholars have studied cryptozoologists and their influence ( including the pseudoscience's association with young earth creationism ) , and have noted parallels in cryptozoology and other pseudosciences such as ghost hunting and ufology .
as a field , cryptozoology originates from the works of bernard heuvelmans , a belgian zoologist , and ivan t .
sanderson , a scottish zoologist .
notably , heuvelmans published " on the track of unknown animals " ( french " sur la piste des bêtes ignorées " ) in *num* , a landmark work among cryptozoologists that was followed by numerous other like works .
similarly , sanderson published a series of books that assisted in developing hallmarks of cryptozoology , including " abominable snowmen : legend come to life " ( *num* ) .
the term " cryptozoology " dates from *num* or before – heuvelmans attributes the coinage of the term " cryptozoology " ( ' the study of hidden animals ' ) to sanderson .
patterned after " cryptozoology " , the term " cryptid " was coined in *num* by cryptozoologist j .
e .
wall in the summer issue of the international society of cryptozoology newsletter .
according to wall " [ it has been ] suggested that new terms be coined to replace sensational and often misleading terms like ' monster ' .
my suggestion is ' cryptid ' , meaning a living thing having the quality of being hidden or unknown .
.
.
describing those creatures which are ( or may be ) subjects of cryptozoological investigation .
" the " oxford english dictionary " defines the noun " cryptid " as " an animal whose existence or survival to the present day is disputed or unsubstantiated ; any animal of interest to a cryptozoologist " .
while used by most cryptozoologists , the term " cryptid " is not used by academic zoologists .
in a textbook aimed at undergraduates , academics caleb w .
lack and jacques rousseau note that the subculture's focus on what it deems to be " cryptids " is a pseudoscientic extension of older belief in monsters and other similar entities from the folklore record , yet with a " new , more scientific-sounding name : cryptids " .
while biologists regularly identify new species , cryptozoologists often focus on creatures from the folklore record .
most famously , these include the loch ness monster , bigfoot , the chupacabra , as well as other " imposing beasts that could be labeled as monsters " .
in their search for these entities , cryptozoologists may employ devices such as motion-sensitive cameras , night-vision equipment , and audio-recording equipment .
while there have been attempts to codify cryptozoological approaches , unlike biologists , zoologists , botanists , and other academic disciplines , however , " there are no accepted , uniform , or successful methods for pursuing cryptids " .
some scholars have identified precursors to modern cryptozoology in certain medieval approaches to the folklore record , and the psychology behind the cryptozoology approach has been the subject of academic study .
few cryptozoologists have a formal science education , and fewer still have a science background directly relevant to cryptozoology .
adherents often misrepresent the academic backgrounds of cryptozoologists .
according to writer daniel loxton and paleontologist donald prothero , " cryptozoologists have often promoted ' professor roy mackal , phd .
' as one of their leading figures and one of the few with a legitimate doctorate in biology .
what is rarely mentioned , however , is that he had no training that would qualify him to undertake competent research on exotic animals .
this raises the specter of ' credential mongering ' , by which an individual or organization feints a person's graduate degree as proof of expertise , even though his or her training is not specifically relevant to the field under consideration .
" besides heuvalmans , sanderson , and mackal , notable cryptozoologists with academic backgrounds include grover krantz , karl shuker , and richard greenwell .
historically , notable cryptozoologists have often identified instances featuring " irrefutable evidence " ( such as sanderson and krantz ) , only for the evidence to be revealed as the product of a hoax .
this may occur during a closer examination by experts or upon confession of the hoaxer .
a subset of cryptozoology promotes the pseudoscience of young earth creationism , rejecting conventional science in favor of a biblical interpretation and promoting concepts such as " living dinosaurs " .
science writer sharon a .
hill observes that the young earth creationist segment of cryptozoology is " well-funded and able to conduct expeditions with a goal of finding a living dinosaur that they think would invalidate evolution .
" anthropologist jeb j .
card says that " creationists have embraced cryptozoology and some cryptozoological expeditions are funded by and conducted by creationists hoping to disprove evolution .
" in a *num* interview , paleontologist donald prothero notes an uptick in creationist cryptozoologists .
he observes that " [ p ] eople who actively search for loch ness monsters or mokele mbembe do it entirely as creationist ministers .
they think that if they found a dinosaur in the congo it would overturn all of evolution .
it wouldn't .
it would just be a late-occurring dinosaur , but that's their mistaken notion of evolution .
" media outlets have often uncritically disseminated information from cryptozoologist sources , including newspapers that repeat false claims made by cryptozoologists or television shows that feature cryptozoologists as monster hunters ( such as the popular and purportedly nonfiction american television show " monsterquest " , which aired from 2007-2010 ) .
media coverage of purported " cryptids " often fails to provide more likely explanations , further propagating claims made by cryptozoologists .
the *num* discovery of the fossil remains of " homo floresiensis " was cited by paleontologist henry gee , a senior editor at the journal " nature " , as possible evidence that " in geological terms , makes it more likely that stories of other mythical , human-like creatures such as yetis are founded on grains of truth .
" " cryptozoology , " gee says , " can come in from the cold .
" however , cryptozoology is widely criticised for an array of reasons and is rejected by the academic world .
there is a broad consensus from academics that cryptozoology is a pseudoscience .
the field is regularly criticized for reliance on anecdotal information and because in the course of investigating animals that most scientists believe are unlikely to have existed , cryptozoologists do not follow the scientific method .
hill notes that " there is no academic course of study in cryptozoology or no university degree program that will bestow the title ' cryptozoologist ' .
" anthropologist jeb j .
card summarizes cryptozoology in a survey of pseudoscience and pseudoarchaeology : card notes that " cryptozoologists often show their disdain and even hatred for professional scientists , including those who enthusiastically participated in cryptozoology " , which he traces back to heuvelmans's early " rage against critics of cryptozoology " .
he finds parallels with cryptozoology and other pseudosciences , such as ghost hunting and ufology , and compares the approach of cryptozoologists to colonial big-game hunters , and to aspects of european imperialism .
according to card , " most cryptids are framed as the subject of indigenous legends typically collected in the heyday of comparative folklore , though such legends may be heavily modified or worse .
cryptozoology's complicated mix of sympathy , interest , and appropriation of indigenous culture ( or non-indigenous construction of it ) is also found in new age circles and dubious " indian burial grounds " and other legends .

invoked in hauntings such as the " amityville " hoax .

" .
in a *num* foreword for " the american biology teacher " , then national association of biology teachers president dan ward uses cryptozoology as an example of " technological pseudoscience " that may confuse students about the scientific method .
ward says that " cryptozoology .
.
.
is not valid science or even science at all .
it is monster hunting .
" historian of science brian regal includes an entry for cryptozoology in his " pseudoscience : a critical encyclopedia " ( *num* ) .
regal says that " as an intellectual endeavor , cryptozoology has been studied as much as cryptozoologists have sought hidden animals " .
in a *num* issue of " folklore " , folklorist véronique campion-vincent says : campion-vincent says that " four currents can be distinguished in the study of mysterious animal appearances " : " forteans " ( " compiler [ s ] of anomalies " such as via publications like the " fortean times " ) , " occultists " ( which she describes as related to " forteans " ) , " folklorists " , and " cryptozoologists " .
regarding cryptozoologists , campion-vincent says that " this movement seems to deserve the appellation of parascience , like parapsychology : the same corpus is reviewed ; many scientists participate , but for those who have an official status of university professor or researcher , the participation is a private hobby " .
in her " encyclopedia of american folklore " , academic linda watts says that " folklore concerning unreal animals or beings , sometimes called monsters , is a popular field of inquiry " and describes cryptozoology as an example of " american narrative traditions " that " feature many monsters " .
in his analysis of cryptozoology , folklorist peter dendle says that " cryptozoology devotees consciously position themselves in defiance of mainstream science " and that : in a paper published in *num* , dendle refers to cryptozoologists as " contemporary monster hunters " that " keep alive a sense of wonder in a world that has been very thoroughly charted , mapped , and tracked , and that is largely available for close scrutiny on google earth and satellite imaging " and that " on the whole the devotion of substantial resources for this pursuit betrays a lack of awareness of the basis for scholarly consensus ( largely ignoring , for instance , evidence of evolutionary biology and the fossil record ) .
" according to historian mike dash , few scientists doubt there are thousands of unknown animals , particularly invertebrates , awaiting discovery ; however , cryptozoologists are largely uninterested in researching and cataloging newly discovered species of ants or beetles , instead focusing their efforts towards " more elusive " creatures that have often defied decades of work aimed at confirming their existence .
paleontologist george gaylord simpson ( *num* ) lists cryptozoology among examples of human gullibility , along with creationism : paleontologist donald prothero ( *num* ) cites cryptozoology as an example of pseudoscience , and categorizes it along with holocaust denial and ufo abductions claims as aspects of american culture that are " clearly baloney " .
in " scientifical americans : the culture of amateur paranormal researchers " ( *num* ) , hill surveys the field and discusses aspects of the subculture , noting internal attempts at creating more scientific approaches and the involvement of young earth creationists and a prevalence of hoaxes .
she concludes that many cryptozoologists are " passionate and sincere in their belief that mystery animals exist .
as such , they give deference to every report of a sighting , often without critical questioning .
as with the ghost seekers , cryptozoologists are convinced that they will be the ones to solve the mystery and make history .
with the lure of mystery and money undermining diligent and ethical research , the field of cryptozoology has serious credibility problems .
" there have been several organizations , of varying types , dedicated or related to cryptozoology .
ferrari ferrari n .
v .
( ; ) is an italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in maranello .
founded by enzo ferrari in *num* out of alfa romeo's race division as " auto avio costruzioni " , the company built its first car in *num* .
however , the company's inception as an auto manufacturer is usually recognized in *num* , when the first ferrari-badged car was completed .
in *num* , ferrari was rated the world's most powerful brand by brand finance .
in june *num* , the *num* *num* gto became the most expensive car in history , setting an all-time record selling price of $70 million .
fiat s .
p .
a .
acquired *num* % of ferrari in *num* and expanded its stake to *num* % in *num* .
in october *num* fiat chrysler automobiles n .
v .
( fca ) announced its intentions to separate ferrari s .
p .
a .
from fca ; as of the announcement fca owned *num* % of ferrari .
the separation began in october *num* with a restructuring that established ferrari n .
v .
( a company incorporated in the netherlands ) as the new holding company of the ferrari group and the subsequent sale by fca of *num* % of the shares in an ipo and concurrent listing of common shares on the new york stock exchange .
through the remaining steps of the separation , fca's interest in ferrari's business was distributed to shareholders of fca , with *num* % continuing to be owned by piero ferrari .
the spin-off was completed on *num* january *num* .
throughout its history , the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing , especially in formula one , where it is the oldest and most successful racing team , holding the most constructors championships ( *num* ) and having produced the highest number of drivers ' championship wins ( *num* ) .
ferrari road cars are generally seen as a symbol of speed , luxury and wealth .
enzo ferrari was not initially interested in the idea of producing road cars when he formed scuderia ferrari in *num* , with headquarters in modena .
scuderia ferrari ( pronounced ) literally means " ferrari stable " and is usually used to mean " team ferrari .
" ferrari bought , prepared , and fielded alfa romeo racing cars for gentleman drivers , functioning as the racing division of alfa romeo .
in *num* , alfa romeo withdrew its in-house racing team and scuderia ferrari took over as its works team : the " scuderia " received alfa's grand prix cars of the latest specifications and fielded many famous drivers such as tazio nuvolari and achille varzi .
in *num* , alfa romeo brought its racing operation again in-house , forming " alfa corse " in milan and hired enzo ferrari as manager of the new racing department ; therefore the scuderia ferrari was disbanded .
in september *num* , ferrari left alfa romeo under the provision he would not use the ferrari name in association with races or racing cars for at least four years .
a few days later he founded " auto avio costruzioni " , headquartered in the facilities of the old " scuderia ferrari " .
the new company ostensibly produced machine tools and aircraft accessories .
in *num* , ferrari produced a race car – the tipo *num* , based on a fiat platform .
it was the first ferrari car and debuted at the *num* mille miglia , but due to world war ii it saw little competition .
in *num* , the ferrari factory moved to maranello , where it has remained ever since .
the factory was bombed by the allies and subsequently rebuilt including a works for road car production .
the first ferrari-badged car was the *num* *num* s , powered by a *num* .
*num* l v12 engine ; enzo ferrari reluctantly built and sold his automobiles to fund scuderia ferrari .
the " scuderia ferrari " name was resurrected to denote the factory racing cars and distinguish them from those fielded by customer teams .
in *num* the company was restructured as a public corporation under the name sefac s .
p .
a .
early in *num* , fiat took a *num* % stake in ferrari .
an immediate result was an increase in available investment funds , and work started at once on a factory extension intended to transfer production from fiat's turin plant of the ferrari engined fiat dino .
new model investment further up in the ferrari range also received a boost .
in *num* , enzo ferrari oversaw the launch of the ferrari f40 , the last new ferrari launched before his death later that year .
in *num* , the company was renamed ferrari s .
p .
a .
from *num* to *num* , ferrari produced the enzo , their fastest model at the time , which was introduced and named in honor of the company's founder , enzo ferrari .
it was to be called the f60 , continuing on from the f40 and f50 , but ferrari was so pleased with it , they called it the enzo instead .
it was initially offered to loyal and recurring customers , each of the *num* made ( minus the *ord* which was donated to the vatican for charity ) had a price tag of $650 , *num* apiece ( equivalent to £400 , *num* ) .
on *num* september *num* , *num* ferrari cars ( worth over $162 million- which is equivalent to £99 , *num* , *num* ) attended the ferrari driving days event at silverstone circuit and paraded round the silverstone circuit setting a world record .
ferrari's former ceo and chairman , luca di montezemolo , resigned from the company after *num* years , who was succeeded by amedeo felisa and finally on *num* may *num* amedeo resigned and was succeeded by sergio marchionne , ceo and chairman of fiat chrysler automobiles , ferrari's parent company .
in july *num* , marchionne was replaced by board member louis camilleri as ceo and by john elkann as chairman .
on *num* october *num* , the fca group , resulting from the merger between manufacturers fiat and chrysler , announced the split of its luxury brand , ferrari .
the aim is to turn ferrari into an independent brand which *num* % of stake will be sold in an ipo in *num* .
ferrari officially priced its initial public offering at $52 a share after the market close on *num* october *num* .
since the company's beginnings , ferrari has been involved in motorsport , competing in a range of categories including formula one and sports car racing through its scuderia ferrari sporting division as well as supplying cars and engines to other teams and for one make race series .
the *num* aac *num* was the first racing car to be designed by enzo ferrari , although it was not badged as a ferrari model .
"scuderia " ferrari has participated in several classes of motorsport , though it is currently only officially involved in formula one .
it is the only team to have competed in the formula one world championship continuously since its inception in *num* .
josé froilán gonzález gave the team its first f1 victory at the *num* british grand prix .
alberto ascari gave ferrari its first drivers championship a year later .
ferrari is the oldest team in the championship , and the most successful : the team holds nearly every formula one record .
, the team's records include *num* world drivers championship titles , *num* world constructors championship titles , *num* grand prix victories , *num* .
*num* points , *num* podium finishes , *num* pole positions , and *num* fastest laps in *num* grands prix contested .
of the *num* tracks used in *num* , *num* have lap records set by the f2004 , with a further *num* set by the f2003-ga , f2008 and f10 .
ferrari drivers include : tazio nuvolari , josé froilán gonzález , juan manuel fangio , alberto ascari , luigi chinetti , maurice trintignant , wolfgang von trips , phil hill , olivier gendebien , mike hawthorn , peter collins , giancarlo baghetti , ricardo rodríguez , chris amon , john surtees , lorenzo bandini , ludovico scarfiotti , jacky ickx , mario andretti , clay regazzoni , niki lauda , carlos reutemann , jody scheckter , gilles villeneuve , didier pironi , patrick tambay , rené arnoux , michele alboreto , gerhard berger , nigel mansell , alain prost , jean alesi , michael schumacher , eddie irvine , rubens barrichello , felipe massa , kimi räikkönen , fernando alonso , and sebastian vettel .
at the end of the *num* season , the team courted controversy by continuing to allow marlboro to sponsor them after they , along with the other f1 teams , made a promise to end sponsorship deals with tobacco manufacturers .
a five-year deal was agreed and although this was not due to end until *num* , in april *num* marlboro dropped their on-car branding on ferrari .
in addition to formula one , ferrari also entered cars in sportscar racing , the two programs existing in parallel for many years .
in *num* , luigi chinetti drove a *num* m to ferrari's first win in motorsports , the *num* hours of le mans .
ferrari went on to dominate the early years of the world sportscar championship which was created in *num* , winning the title seven out of its first nine years .
when the championship format changed in *num* , ferrari earned titles in at least one class each year through to *num* and then again in *num* .
ferrari would win one final title , the *num* world championship of makes before enzo decided to leave sports car racing after *num* and allow scuderia ferrari to concentrate solely on formula one .
during ferrari's seasons of the world sportscars championship , they also gained more wins at the *num* hours of le mans , with the factory team earning their first in .
another win would come in , followed by five consecutive wins from to .
luigi chinetti's north american racing team ( nart ) would take ferrari's final victory at le mans in .
although scuderia ferrari no longer participated in sports cars after *num* , they have occasionally built various successful sports cars for privateers .
these include the bb *num* lm in the 1970s , the *num* sp which won the imsa gt championship in the 1990s , and currently the *num* gt2 and gt3 which are currently winning championships in their respective classes .
throughout its history , ferrari has supplied racing cars to other entrants , aside from its own works scuderia ferrari team .
in the 1950s and ' 60s , ferrari supplied formula one cars to a number of private entrants and other teams .
one famous example was tony vandervell's team , which raced the thinwall special modified ferraris before building their own vanwall cars .
the north american racing team's entries in the final three rounds of the *num* season were the last occasions on which a team other than scuderia ferrari entered a world championship grand prix with a ferrari car .
ferrari supplied cars complete with v8 engines for the a1 grand prix series , from the 2008-09 season .
the car was designed by rory byrne and is styled to resemble the *num* ferrari formula one car .
ferrari currently runs a customer gt program for a racing version of its *num* , and has done so for the 458's predecessors , dating back to the *num* in the late 1990s .
such private teams as the american risi competizione and italian af corse teams have been very successful with ferrari gt racers over the years .
this car , made for endurance sportscar racing to be competed against such racing versions of the audi r8 , mclaren mp4-12c , and bmw z4 ( e89 ) has proven to be successful , but not as successful as its predecessor , the f430 .
the ferrari challenge is a one make racing series for the ferrari *num* .
the fxx is not road legal , and is therefore only used for track events .
the first vehicle made with the ferrari name was the *num* s .
this was primarily a sports / racing model .
in *num* , the *num* inter was introduced marking the company's significant move into the grand touring road car market .
road cars continue to make up the bulk of ferrari sales to the present day .
many early cars featured bodywork designed and customised by independent coachbuilders such as pininfarina , scaglietti , zagato , vignale and bertone .
starting in the early 2010s with the laferrari , focus was shifted to what is now the standard , ferrari relying on in-house design from the centro stile ferrari .
the original road cars were typically two seat front engined v12s .
this platform served ferrari very well through the 1950s and 1960s .
in *num* the dino was introduced as the first two-seat rear mid-engined ferrari .
the dino was produced primarily with a v6 engine , however a v8 model was also developed .
this rear mid-engine layout would go on to be used in many ferraris of the 1980s and 1990s .
current road cars typically use v8 or v12 engines , with v8 models making up well over half of the marque's total production .
historically , ferrari has also produced flat *num* engines .
for a time , ferrari built 2+2 versions of its mid-engined v8 cars .
although they looked quite different from their 2-seat counterparts , both the gt4 and mondial were closely related to the *num* gtb .
the company has also produced several front-engined 2+2 cars , culminating in the current v12 model lusso and v8 models portofino and lusso t .
the california is credited with initiating the popular current model line of v8 front-engined 2+2 grand touring performance sports cars .
ferrari entered the mid-engined 12-cylinder fray with the berlinetta boxer in *num* .
the later testarossa ( also mid-engined *num* cylinder ) remains one of the most popular and famous ferrari road cars of all time .
in the 1950s and 1960s , clients often personalized their vehicles as they came straight from the factory .
this philosophy added to the mystique of the brand .
every ferrari that comes out of maranello is built to an individual customer's specification .
in this sense , each vehicle is a unique result of a specific client's desire .
ferrari formalized this concept with its earlier carrozzeria scaglietti programme .
the options offered here were more typical such as racing seats , rear view cameras and other special trim .
in late *num* , ferrari announced a significant update of this philosophy .
the tailor made programme allows clients to work with designers in maranello to make decisions at every step of the process .
through this program almost any trim , any exterior color or any interior material are possible .
the program carries on the original tradition and emphasizes the idea of each car being unique .
the *num* *num* gto may be considered the first in the line of ferrari supercars .
this pedigree extends through the enzo ferrari to the laferrari .
in march *num* , at the *ord* geneva international motor show , ferrari revealed its latest supercar , the *num* pista .
ferrari has produced a number of concept cars , such as the mythos .
while some of these were quite radical ( such as the modulo ) and never intended for production , others such as the mythos have shown styling elements which were later incorporated into production models .
the most recent concept car to be produced by ferrari themselves was the *num* millechili .
a number of one-off special versions of ferrari road cars have also been produced , commissioned to coachbuilders by wealthy owners .
recent examples include the p4 / *num* and the *num* kappa .
the special projects programme was launched in the late 2000s as ferrari's ultimate in-house personalization service , enabling customers to own bespoke bodied one-offs based on modern ferrari road cars .
engineering and design is done by ferrari , sometimes in cooperation with external design houses like pininfarina or fioravanti , and the vehicles receive full homologation to be road legal .
the first car to be completed under this programme was the *num* sp1 , commissioned by a japanese business executive , the second was the p540 superfast aperta , commissioned by an american collector .
the following is a list of special projects cars that have been made public : an f430 spider that runs on ethanol was displayed at the *num* detroit auto show .
at the *num* geneva motor show , ferrari unveiled a hybrid version of their flagship *num* .
called the " hy-kers concept " , ferrari's hybrid system adds more than *num* horsepower on top of the *num* fiorano's *num* hp .
also in mid-2014 , the flagship laferrari was put into production .
until the early 1990s , ferrari followed a three-number naming scheme based on engine displacement : most ferraris were also given designations referring to their body style .
in general , the following conventions were used : this naming system can be confusing , as some entirely different vehicles used the same engine type and body style .
many ferraris also had other names affixed ( like daytona ) to identify them further .
many such names are actually not official factory names .
the daytona name commemorates ferrari's triple success in the february *num* *num* hours of daytona with the *num* p4 .
only in the *num* daytona *num* hours , a *num* gtb / *num* run by nart ( who raced ferraris in america ) ran second , behind a porsche *num* .
the various dino models were named for enzo's son , dino ferrari , and were marketed as dinos by ferrari and sold at ferrari dealers—for all intents and purposes they are ferraris .
in the mid-1990s , ferrari added the letter " f " to the beginning of all models ( a practice abandoned after the f512 m and f355 , but adopted again with the f430 , but not with its successor , the ferrari *num* ) .
the famous symbol of the ferrari race team is the " cavallino rampante " ( " prancing horse " ) black prancing stallion on a yellow shield , usually with the letters " s f " ( for " scuderia ferrari " ) , with three stripes of green , white and red ( the italian national colors ) at the top .
the road cars have a rectangular badge on the hood ( see picture at top of page ) , and , optionally , the shield-shaped race logo on the sides of both front wings , close to the door .
on *num* june *num* , enzo ferrari won a race at the savio track in ravenna where he met the countess paolina , mother of count francesco baracca , an ace of the italian air force and national hero of world war i , who used to paint a horse on the side of his planes .
the countess asked enzo to use this horse on his cars , suggesting that it would bring him good luck .
the original " prancing horse " on baracca's airplane was painted in red on a white cloud-like shape , but ferrari chose to have the horse in black ( as it had been painted as a sign of grief on baracca's squadron planes after the pilot was killed in action ) and he added a canary yellow background as this is the color of the city of modena , his birthplace .
the ferrari horse was , from the very beginning , markedly different from the baracca horse in most details , the most noticeable being the tail that in the original baracca version was pointing downward .
ferrari has used the " cavallino rampante " on official company stationery since *num* .
since the spa *num* hours of *num* july *num* , the " cavallino rampante " has been used on alfa romeos raced by scuderia ferrari .
the motif of a prancing horse is old , it can be found on ancient coins .
a similar black horse on a yellow shield is the coat of arms of the german city of stuttgart , home of mercedes-benz and the design bureau of porsche , both being main competitors of alfa and ferrari in the 1930s .
the city's name derives from " stutengarten " , an ancient form of the german word " gestüt " , which translates into english as " stud farm " and into italian as " scuderia " .
porsche also includes the stuttgart sign in its corporate logo , centred in the emblem of the state of württemberg .
stuttgart's " rössle " has both rear legs firmly planted on the soil , like baracca's horse , but unlike ferrari's " cavallino " .
fabio taglioni used the " cavallino rampante " on his ducati motorbikes , as taglioni was born at lugo di romagna like baracca , and his father too was a military pilot during wwi ( although not part of baracca's squadron , as is sometimes mistakenly reported ) .
as ferrari's fame grew , ducati abandoned the horse- perhaps the result of a private agreement between the two companies .
the " cavallino rampante " is the visual symbol of ferrari .
cavallino magazine uses the name , but not the logo .
other companies use similar logos : avanti , an austrian company operating over *num* filling stations , uses a prancing horse logo which is nearly identical to ferrari's , as does iron horse bicycles and norfolk southern railway .
since the 1920s , italian race cars of alfa romeo , maserati and later ferrari and abarth were ( and often still are ) painted in " race red " ( " rosso corsa " ) .
this was the customary national racing color of italy , as recommended between the world wars by the organizations that later would become the fia .
it refers to the nationality of the competing team , not that of the car manufacturer or driver .
in that scheme , french-entered cars such as bugatti were blue , german such as auto union and mercedes white ( since *num* also bare sheet metal silver ) , and british green such as the mid-1960s lotus and brm , for instance .
ferrari won the *num* world championship with john surtees by competing the last two races in north america with cars painted in the us-american race colors white and blue , as these were not entered by the italian factory themselves , but by the u .
s .
-based north american racing team ( nart ) team .
this was done as a protest concerning arguments between ferrari and the italian racing authorities regarding the homologation of a new mid-engined ferrari race car .
in *num* , enzo ferrari was approached by the ford motor company about a possible buy out .
ford audited ferrari's assets but legal negotiations and talks were unilaterally cut off by ferrari when he realized that the deal offered by ford would not enable him to stay at the helm of the company racing program .
henry ford ii consequently directed his racing division to negotiate with lotus , lola , and cooper to build a car capable of beating ferrari on the world endurance circuit , eventually resulting in the production of the ford gt40 in *num* .
as the ford deal fell through , fiat approached ferrari with a more flexible proposal and purchased controlling interests in the company in *num* .
enzo ferrari retained a *num* % share , which is currently owned by his son piero lardi ferrari .
ferrari has an internally managed merchandising line that licenses many products bearing the ferrari brand , including eyewear , pens , pencils , electronic goods , perfume , cologne , clothing , high-tech bicycles , watches , cell phones and laptop computers .
ferrari also runs a museum , the museo ferrari in maranello , which displays road and race cars and other items from the company's history .
in *num* ferrari launched a long term master planned effort to improve overall corporate efficiency , production and employee happiness .
the program was called formula uomo and became a case study in social sustainability .
it took over ten years to fully implement and included over €200 million ( *num* ) in investment .
ferrari has had a long-standing relationship with shell oil .
it is a technical partnership with ferrari and ducati to test as well as supply fuel and oils to the formula one , motogp and world superbike racing teams .
for example , the shell v-power premium gasoline fuel has been developed with the many years of technical expertise between shell and ferrari .
ferrari have had agreements to supply formula one engines to a number of other teams over the years , and currently supply sauber f1 team , and haas f1 team .
as of the end of *num* , the total of ferrari built and sold cars in their whole company history is *num* , *num* .
approximately thirty ferrari boutiques exist worldwide , with two owned by ferrari and the rest operating as franchises .
the stores sell branded clothes , accessories and racing memorabilia .
clothing includes upscale and lower priced collections for men , women , and children .
some stores include race car simulation games for entertainment .
foreign policy of the united states the foreign policy of the united states is its interactions with foreign nations and how it sets standards of interaction for its organizations , corporations and system citizens of the united states .
the officially stated goals of the foreign policy of the united states , including all the bureaus and offices in the united states department of state , as mentioned in the " foreign policy agenda " of the department of state , are " to build and sustain a more democratic , secure , and prosperous world for the benefit of the american people and the international community .
" in addition , the united states house committee on foreign affairs states as some of its jurisdictional goals : " export controls , including nonproliferation of nuclear technology and nuclear hardware ; measures to foster commercial interaction with foreign nations and to safeguard american business abroad ; international commodity agreements ; international education ; and protection of american citizens abroad and expatriation .
" u .
s .
foreign policy and foreign aid have been the subject of much debate , praise and criticism , both domestically and abroad .
subject to the advice and consent role of the u .
s .
senate , the president of the united states negotiates treaties with foreign nations , but treaties enter into force only if ratified by two-thirds of the senate .
the president is also commander in chief of the united states armed forces , and as such has broad authority over the armed forces .
both the secretary of state and ambassadors are appointed by the president , with the advice and consent of the senate .
the united states secretary of state acts similarly to a foreign minister and under executive leadership is the primary conductor of state-to-state diplomacy .
congress is the only branch of government that has the authority to declare war .
furthermore , congress writes the civilian and military budget , thus has vast power in military action and foreign aid .
congress also has power to regulate commerce with foreign nations .
the main trend regarding the history of u .
s .
foreign policy since the american revolution is the shift from non-interventionism before and after world war i , to its growth as a world power and global hegemony during and since world war ii and the end of the cold war in the *ord* century .
since the *ord* century , u .
s .
foreign policy also has been characterized by a shift from the realist school to the idealistic or wilsonian school of international relations .
foreign policy themes were expressed considerably in george washington's farewell address ; these included among other things , observing good faith and justice towards all nations and cultivating peace and harmony with all , excluding both " inveterate antipathies against particular nations , and passionate attachments for others " , " steer [ ing ] clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world " , and advocating trade with all nations .
these policies became the basis of the federalist party in the 1790s , but the rival jeffersonians feared britain and favored france in the 1790s , declaring the war of *num* on britain .
after the *num* alliance with france , the u .
s .
did not sign another permanent treaty until the north atlantic treaty in *num* .
over time , other themes , key goals , attitudes , or stances have been variously expressed by presidential ' doctrines ' , named for them .
initially these were uncommon events , but since wwii , these have been made by most presidents .
jeffersonians vigorously opposed a large standing army and any navy until attacks against american shipping by barbary corsairs spurred the country into developing a naval force projection capability , resulting in the first barbary war in *num* .
despite two wars with european powers—the war of *num* and the spanish–american war in 1898—american foreign policy was mostly peaceful and marked by steady expansion of its foreign trade during the *ord* century .
the louisiana purchase in *num* doubled the nation's geographical area ; spain ceded the territory of florida in *num* ; annexation brought in the independent texas republic in *num* ; a war with mexico added california , arizona , utah , nevada , and new mexico in *num* .
the u .
s .
bought alaska from the russian empire in *num* , and it annexed the independent republic of hawaii in *num* .
victory over spain in *num* brought the philippines and puerto rico , as well as oversight of cuba .
the short experiment in imperialism ended by *num* , as the u .
s .
turned its attention to the panama canal and the stabilization of regions to its south , including mexico .
the *ord* century was marked by two world wars in which allied powers , along with the united states , defeated their enemies , and through this participation the united states increased its international reputation .
president wilson's fourteen points was developed from his idealistic wilsonianism program of spreading democracy and fighting militarism to prevent future wars .
it became the basis of the german armistice ( which amounted to a military surrender ) and the *num* paris peace conference .
the resulting treaty of versailles , due to european allies ' punitive and territorial designs , showed insufficient conformity with these points , and the u .
s .
signed separate treaties with each of its adversaries ; due to senate objections also , the u .
s .
never joined the league of nations , which was established as a result of wilson's initiative .
in the 1920s , the united states followed an independent course , and succeeded in a program of naval disarmament , and refunding the german economy .
operating outside the league it became a dominant player in diplomatic affairs .
new york became the financial capital of the world , but the wall street crash of *num* hurled the western industrialized world into the great depression .
american trade policy relied on high tariffs under the republicans , and reciprocal trade agreements under the democrats , but in any case exports were at very low levels in the 1930s .
the united states adopted a non-interventionist foreign policy from *num* to *num* , but then president franklin d .
roosevelt moved toward strong support of the allies in their wars against germany and japan .
as a result of intense internal debate , the national policy was one of becoming the arsenal of democracy , that is financing and equipping the allied armies without sending american combat soldiers .
roosevelt mentioned four fundamental freedoms , which ought to be enjoyed by people " everywhere in the world " ; these included the freedom of speech and religion , as well as freedom from want and fear .
roosevelt helped establish terms for a post-war world among potential allies at the atlantic conference ; specific points were included to correct earlier failures , which became a step toward the united nations .
american policy was to threaten japan , to force it out of china , and to prevent its attacking the soviet union .
however , japan reacted by an attack on pearl harbor in december *num* , and the united states was at war with japan , germany , and italy .
instead of the loans given to allies in world war i , the united states provided lend-lease grants of $50 , *num* , *num* , *num* .
working closely with winston churchill of britain , and joseph stalin of the soviet union , roosevelt sent his forces into the pacific against japan , then into north africa against italy and germany , and finally into europe starting with france and italy in *num* against the germans .
the american economy roared forward , doubling industrial production , and building vast quantities of airplanes , ships , tanks , munitions , and , finally , the atomic bomb .
much of the american war effort went to strategic bombers , which flattened the cities of japan and germany .
after the war , the u .
s .
rose to become the dominant non-colonial economic power with broad influence in much of the world , with the key policies of the marshall plan and the truman doctrine .
almost immediately , however , the world witnessed division into broad two camps during the cold war ; one side was led by the u .
s .
and the other by the soviet union , but this situation also led to the establishment of the non-aligned movement .
this period lasted until almost the end of the *ord* century and is thought to be both an ideological and power struggle between the two superpowers .
a policy of containment was adopted to limit soviet expansion , and a series of proxy wars were fought with mixed results .
in *num* , the soviet union dissolved into separate nations , and the cold war formally ended as the united states gave separate diplomatic recognition to the russian federation and other former soviet states .
in domestic politics , foreign policy is not usually a central issue .
in 1945–1970 the democratic party took a strong anti-communist line and supported wars in korea and vietnam .
then the party split with a strong , " dovish " , pacifist element ( typified by *num* presidential candidate george mcgovern ) .
many " hawks " , advocates for war , joined the neoconservative movement and started supporting the republicans—especially reagan—based on foreign policy .
meanwhile , down to *num* the republican party was split between an isolationist wing , based in the midwest and led by senator robert a .
taft , and an internationalist wing based in the east and led by dwight d .
eisenhower .
eisenhower defeated taft for the *num* nomination largely on foreign policy grounds .
since then the republicans have been characterized by a hawkish and intense american nationalism , and strong opposition to communism , and strong support for israel .
in the *ord* century , u .
s .
influence remains strong but , in relative terms , is declining in terms of economic output compared to rising nations such as china , india , russia , and the newly consolidated european union .
substantial problems remain , such as climate change , nuclear proliferation , and the specter of nuclear terrorism .
foreign policy analysts hachigian and sutphen in their book " the next american century " suggest all five powers have similar vested interests in stability and terrorism prevention and trade ; if they can find common ground , then the next decades may be marked by peaceful growth and prosperity .
in *num* diplomats from other countries developed new tactics to deal with president donald trump .
the " new york times " reported on the eve of his first foreign trip as president : trump has numerous aides giving advice on foreign policy .
the chief diplomat was secretary of state rex tillerson .
his major foreign policy positions , which sometimes are at odds with trump , include : in the united states , there are three types of treaty-related law : in contrast to most other nations , the united states considers the three types of agreements as distinct .
further , the united states incorporates treaty law into the body of u .
s .
federal law .
as a result , congress can modify or repeal treaties afterward .
it can overrule an agreed-upon treaty obligation even if that is seen as a violation of the treaty under international law .
several u .
s .
court rulings confirmed this understanding , including supreme court decisions in " paquete habana v .
the united states " ( *num* ) , and " reid v .
covert " ( *num* ) , as well as a lower court ruling in " garcia-mir v .
meese " ( *num* ) .
further , the supreme court has declared itself as having the power to rule a treaty as void by declaring it " unconstitutional " although as of *num* , it has never exercised that power .
the state department has taken the position that the vienna convention on the law of treaties represents established law .
generally , when the u .
s .
signs a treaty , it is binding .
however , as a result of the " reid v .
covert " decision , the u .
s .
adds a reservation to the text of every treaty that says in effect that the u .
s .
intends to abide by the treaty but that if the treaty is found to be in violation of the constitution , the u .
s .
legally is then unable to abide by the treaty since the u .
s .
signature would be " ultra vires " .
the united states has ratified and participates in many other multilateral treaties , including arms control treaties ( especially with the soviet union ) , human rights treaties , environmental protocols , and free trade agreements .
the united states is a founding member of the united nations and most of its specialized agencies , notably the world bank group and international monetary fund .
the u .
s .
has at times withheld payment of dues , owing to disagreements with the un .
the united states is also member of : after it captured the islands from japan during world war ii , the united states administered the trust territory of the pacific islands from *num* to *num* ( *num* for palau ) .
the northern mariana islands became a u .
s .
territory ( part of the united states ) , while federated states of micronesia , the marshall islands , and palau became independent countries .
each has signed a compact of free association that gives the united states exclusive military access in return for u .
s .
defense protection and conduct of military foreign affairs ( except the declaration of war ) and a few billion dollars of aid .
these agreements also generally allow citizens of these countries to live and work in the united states with their spouses ( and vice versa ) , and provide for largely free trade .
the federal government also grants access to services from domestic agencies , including the federal emergency management agency , national weather service , the united states postal service , the federal aviation administration , the federal communications commission , and u .
s .
representation to the international frequency registration board of the international telecommunication union .
the united states notably does not participate in various international agreements adhered to by almost all other industrialized countries , by almost all the countries of the americas , or by almost all other countries in the world .
with a large population and economy , on a practical level this can undermine the effect of certain agreements , or give other countries a precedent to cite for non-participation in various agreements .
in some cases the arguments against participation include that the united states should maximize its sovereignty and freedom of action , or that ratification would create a basis for lawsuits that would treat american citizens unfairly .
in other cases , the debate became involved in domestic political issues , such as gun control , climate change , and the death penalty .
examples include : while america's relationships with europe have tended to be in terms of multilateral frameworks , such as nato , america's relations with asia have tended to be based on a " hub and spoke " model using a series of bilateral relationships where states coordinate with the united states and do not collaborate with each other .
on may *num* , *num* , at the shangri-la dialogue defense secretary robert m .
gates urged the nations of asia to build on this hub and spoke model as they established and grew multilateral institutions such as asean , apec and the ad hoc arrangements in the area .
however , in *num* gates said that the united states must serve as the " indispensable nation , " for building multilateral cooperation .
as of *num* , the u .
s .
currently produces about *num* % of the oil that it consumes .
while its imports have exceeded domestic production since the early 1990s , new hydraulic fracturing techniques and discovery of shale oil deposits in canada and the american dakotas offer the potential for increased energy independence from oil exporting countries such as opec .
former u .
s .
president george w .
bush identified dependence on imported oil as an urgent " "national security concern " .
" two-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves are estimated to be found in the persian gulf .
despite its distance , the persian gulf region was first proclaimed to be of national interest to the united states during world war ii .
petroleum is of central importance to modern armies , and the united states—as the world's leading oil producer at that time—supplied most of the oil for the allied armies .
many u .
s .
strategists were concerned that the war would dangerously reduce the u .
s .
oil supply , and so they sought to establish good relations with saudi arabia , a kingdom with large oil reserves .
the persian gulf region continued to be regarded as an area of vital importance to the united states during the cold war .
three cold war united states presidential doctrines—the truman doctrine , the eisenhower doctrine , and the nixon doctrine—played roles in the formulation of the carter doctrine , which stated that the united states would use military force if necessary to defend its " national interests " in the persian gulf region .
carter's successor , president ronald reagan , extended the policy in october *num* with what is sometimes called the " "reagan corollary to the carter doctrine" " , which proclaimed that the united states would intervene to protect saudi arabia , whose security was threatened after the outbreak of the iran–iraq war .
some analysts have argued that the implementation of the carter doctrine and the reagan corollary also played a role in the outbreak of the *num* iraq war .
almost all of canada's energy exports go to the united states , making it the largest foreign source of u .
s .
energy imports : canada is consistently among the top sources for u .
s .
oil imports , and it is the largest source of u .
s .
natural gas and electricity imports .
in *num* the u .
s .
was sub-saharan africa's largest single export market accounting for *num* % of exports ( second in total to the eu at *num* % ) .
*num* % of u .
s .
imports from this region were petroleum products .
foreign assistance is a core component of the state department's international affairs budget , which is $49 billion in all for *num* .
aid is considered an essential instrument of u .
s .
foreign policy .
there are four major categories of non-military foreign assistance : bilateral development aid , economic assistance supporting u .
s .
political and security goals , humanitarian aid , and multilateral economic contributions ( for example , contributions to the world bank and international monetary fund ) .
in absolute dollar terms , the united states government is the largest international aid donor ( $23 billion in *num* ) .
the u .
s .
agency for international development ( usaid ) manages the bulk of bilateral economic assistance ; the treasury department handles most multilateral aid .
in addition many private agencies , churches and philanthropies provide aid .
although the united states is the largest donor in absolute dollar terms , it is actually ranked *num* out of *num* countries on the commitment to development index .
the cdi ranks the *num* richest donor countries on their policies that affect the developing world .
in the aid component the united states is penalized for low net aid volume as a share of the economy , a large share of tied or partially tied aid , and a large share of aid given to less poor and relatively undemocratic governments .
foreign aid is a highly partisan issue in the united states , with liberals , on average , supporting foreign aid much more than conservatives do .
as of *num* , the united states is actively conducting military operations against the islamic state of iraq and the levant and al-qaeda under the authorization for use of military force against terrorists , including in areas of fighting in the syrian civil war and yemeni civil war .
the guantanamo bay naval base holds what the federal government considers unlawful combatants from these ongoing activities , and has been a controversial issue in foreign relations , domestic politics , and cuba–united states relations .
other major u .
s .
military concerns include stability in afghanistan and iraq after the recent u .
s .
–led invasions of those countries , russian military activity in ukraine and saudi arabian–led intervention in yemen .
the united states is a founding member of nato , an alliance of *num* north american and european nations formed to defend western europe against the soviet union during the cold war .
under the nato charter , the united states is compelled to defend any nato state that is attacked by a foreign power .
the united states itself was the first country to invoke the mutual defense provisions of the alliance , in response to the september *num* attacks .
the united states also has mutual military defense treaties with : the united states has responsibility for the defense of the three compact of free association states : federated states of micronesia , the marshall islands , and palau .
in *num* , the united states also granted five nations the major non-nato ally status ( mnna ) , and additions by later presidents have brought the list to *num* nations .
each such state has a unique relationship with the united states , involving various military and economic partnerships and alliances .
and lesser agreements with : the u .
s .
participates in various military-related multi-lateral organizations , including : the u .
s .
also operates hundreds of military bases around the world .
the united states has undertaken unilateral and multilateral military operations throughout its history ( see timeline of united states military operations ) .
in the post-world war ii era , the country has had permanent membership and veto power in the united nations security council , allowing it to undertake any military action without formal security council opposition .
with vast military expenditures , the united states is known as the sole remaining superpower after the collapse of the soviet union .
the u .
s .
contributes a relatively small number of personnel for united nations peacekeeping operations .
it sometimes acts through nato , as with the nato intervention in bosnia and herzegovina , nato bombing of yugoslavia , and isaf in afghanistan , but often acts unilaterally or in ad-hoc coalitions as with the *num* invasion of iraq .
the united nations charter requires that military operations be either for self-defense or affirmatively approved by the security council .
though many of their operations have followed these rules , the united states and nato have been accused of committing crimes against peace in international law , for example in the *num* yugoslavia and *num* iraq operations .
the u .
s .
provides military aid through many different channels .
counting the items that appear in the budget as ' foreign military financing ' and ' plan colombia ' , the u .
s .
spent approximately $4 .
*num* billion in military aid in *num* , of which $2 billion went to israel , $1 .
*num* billion went to egypt , and $1 billion went to colombia .
since *num* / *num* , pakistan has received approximately $11 .
*num* billion in direct military aid .
as of *num* , according to fox news , the u .
s .
had more than *num* military bases in *num* different countries .
estimated u .
s .
foreign military financing and aid by recipient for *num* : according to a *num* report by the congressional research service , the u .
s .
topped the market in global weapon sales for *num* , with $40 billion sold .
the largest buyers were qatar , egypt , saudi arabia , south korea , pakistan , israel , the united arab emirates and iraq .
the strategic defense initiative ( sdi ) was a proposal by u .
s .
president ronald reagan on march *num* , *num* to use ground and space-based systems to protect the united states from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles , later dubbed " "star wars" " .
the initiative focused on strategic defense rather than the prior strategic offense doctrine of mutual assured destruction ( mad ) .
though it was never fully developed or deployed , the research and technologies of sdi paved the way for some anti-ballistic missile systems of today .
in february *num* , the u .
s .
started formal negotiations with poland and czech republic concerning construction of missile shield installations in those countries for a ground-based midcourse defense system ( in april *num* , *num* % of poles opposed the plan ) .
according to press reports the government of the czech republic agreed ( while *num* % czechs disagree ) to host a missile defense radar on its territory while a base of missile interceptors is supposed to be built in poland .
russia threatened to place short-range nuclear missiles on the russia's border with nato if the united states refuses to abandon plans to deploy *num* interceptor missiles and a radar in poland and the czech republic .
in april *num* , putin warned of a new cold war if the americans deployed the shield in central europe .
putin also said that russia is prepared to abandon its obligations under an intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty of *num* with the united states .
on august *num* , *num* , the united states and poland announced a deal to implement the missile defense system in polish territory , with a tracking system placed in the czech republic .
" the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that , of course , the missile defense system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia " , dmitry rogozin , russia's nato envoy , said .
keir a .
lieber and daryl g .
press , argue in foreign affairs that u .
s .
missile defenses are designed to secure washington's nuclear primacy and are chiefly directed at potential rivals , such as russia and china .
the authors note that washington continues to eschew nuclear first strike and contend that deploying missile defenses " would be valuable primarily in an offensive context , not a defensive one ; as an adjunct to a us first strike capability , not as a stand-alone shield " : if the united states launched a nuclear attack against russia ( or china ) , the targeted country would be left with only a tiny surviving arsenal , if any at all .
at that point , even a relatively modest or inefficient missile defense system might well be enough to protect against any retaliatory strikes .
this analysis is corroborated by the pentagon's *num* defense planning guidance ( dpg ) , prepared by then secretary of defense richard cheney and his deputies .
the dpg declares that the united states should use its power to " prevent the reemergence of a new rival " either on former soviet territory or elsewhere .
the authors of the guidance determined that the united states had to " field a missile defense system as a shield against accidental missile launches or limited missile strikes by ' international outlaws' " and also must " find ways to integrate the ' new democracies ' of the former soviet bloc into the u .
s .
-led system " .
the national archive notes that document *num* of the dpg includes wording about " disarming capabilities to destroy " which is followed by several blacked out words .
" this suggests that some of the heavily excised pages in the still-classified dpg drafts may include some discussion of preventive action against threatening nuclear and other wmd programs .
" finally , robert david english , writing in foreign affairs , observes that in addition to the deployment u .
s .
missile defenses , the dpg's second recommendation has also been proceeding on course .
" washington has pursued policies that have ignored russian interests ( and sometimes international law as well ) in order to encircle moscow with military alliances and trade blocs conducive to u .
s .
interests .
" in united states history , critics have charged that presidents have used democracy to justify military intervention abroad .
critics have also charged that the u .
s .
helped local militaries overthrow democratically elected governments in iran , guatemala , and in other instances .
studies have been devoted to the historical success rate of the u .
s .
in exporting democracy abroad .
some studies of american intervention have been pessimistic about the overall effectiveness of u .
s .
efforts to encourage democracy in foreign nations .
until recently , scholars have generally agreed with international relations professor abraham lowenthal that u .
s .
attempts to export democracy have been " negligible , often counterproductive , and only occasionally positive .
" other studies find u .
s .
intervention has had mixed results , and another by hermann and kegley has found that military interventions have improved democracy in other countries .
professor paul w .
drake argued that the u .
s .
first attempted to export democracy in latin america through intervention from *num* to *num* .
drake argued that this was contradictory because international law defines intervention as " dictatorial interference in the affairs of another state for the purpose of altering the condition of things .
" the study suggested that efforts to promote democracy failed because democracy needs to develop out of internal conditions , and can not be forcibly imposed .
there was disagreement about what constituted " democracy " ; drake suggested american leaders sometimes defined democracy in a narrow sense of a nation having elections ; drake suggested a broader understanding was needed .
further , there was disagreement about what constituted a " rebellion " ; drake saw a pattern in which the u .
s .
state department disapproved of any type of rebellion , even so-called " revolutions " , and in some instances rebellions against dictatorships .
historian walter lafeber stated , " the world's leading revolutionary nation ( the u .
s .
) in the eighteenth century became the leading protector of the status quo in the twentieth century .
" mesquita and downs evaluated *num* u .
s .
interventions from *num* to *num* and concluded that in only one case , colombia , did a " full fledged , stable democracy " develop within ten years following the intervention .
samia amin pei argued that nation building in developed countries usually unravelled four to six years after american intervention ended .
pei , based on study of a database on worldwide democracies called " polity " , agreed with mesquita and downs that u .
s .
intervention efforts usually don't produce real democracies , and that most cases result in greater authoritarianism after ten years .
professor joshua muravchik argued u .
s .
occupation was critical for axis power democratization after world war ii , but america's failure to encourage democracy in the third world " prove .
.
.
that u .
s .
military occupation is not a sufficient condition to make a country democratic .
" the success of democracy in former axis countries such as italy were seen as a result of high national per-capita income , although u .
s .
protection was seen as a key to stabilization and important for encouraging the transition to democracy .
steven krasner agreed that there was a link between wealth and democracy ; when per-capita incomes of $6 , *num* were achieved in a democracy , there was little chance of that country ever reverting to an autocracy , according to an analysis of his research in the " los angeles times " .
tures examined *num* cases of american intervention from *num* to *num* , using freedom house data .
a plurality of interventions , *num* , caused no change in the country's democracy .
in *num* instances , the country became less democratic after the intervention .
in the remaining *num* cases , a country became more democratic .
however this does not take into account the direction the country would have gone with no u .
s .
intervention .
hermann and kegley found that american military interventions designed to protect or promote democracy increased freedom in those countries .
peceny argued that the democracies created after military intervention are still closer to an autocracy than a democracy , quoting przeworski " while some democracies are more democratic than others , unless offices are contested , no regime should be considered democratic .
" therefore , peceny concludes , it is difficult to know from the hermann and kegley study whether u .
s .
intervention has only produced less repressive autocratic governments or genuine democracies .
peceny stated that the united states attempted to export democracy in *num* of its *num* 20th-century military interventions .
peceny argued that proliberal policies after military intervention had a positive impact on democracy .
a global survey done by pewglobal indicated that at ( as of *num* ) least *num* surveyed countries have a positive view ( *num* % or above ) of the united states .
with the top ten most positive countries being philippines ( *num* % ) , israel ( *num* % ) , south korea ( *num* % ) , kenya ( *num* % ) , el salvador ( *num* % ) , italy ( *num* % ) , ghana ( *num* % ) , vietnam ( *num* % ) , bangladesh ( *num* % ) , and tanzania ( *num* % ) .
while *num* surveyed countries have the most negative view ( below *num* % ) of the united states .
with the countries being egypt ( *num* % ) , jordan ( *num* % ) , pakistan ( *num* % ) , turkey ( *num* % ) , russia ( *num* % ) , palestinian territories ( *num* % ) , greece ( *num* % ) , argentina ( *num* % ) , lebanon ( *num* % ) , tunisia ( *num* % ) .
americans ' own view of the united states was viewed at *num* % .
international opinion about the us has often changed with different executive administrations .
for example in *num* , the french public favored the united states when president barack obama ( *num* % favorable ) replaced president george w .
bush ( *num* % ) .
after president donald trump took the helm in *num* , french public opinion about the us fell from *num* % to *num* % .
these trends were also seen in other european countries .
united states foreign policy also includes covert actions to topple foreign governments that have been opposed to the united states .
according to j .
dana stuster , writing in " foreign policy " , there are seven " confirmed cases " where the u .
s .
—acting principally through the central intelligence agency ( cia ) , but sometimes with the support of other parts of the u .
s .
government , including the navy and state department—covertly assisted in the overthrow of a foreign government : iran in *num* , guatemala in *num* , congo in *num* , the dominican republic in *num* , south vietnam in *num* , brazil in *num* , and chile in *num* .
stuster states that this list excludes " u .
s .
-supported insurgencies and failed assassination attempts " such as those directed against cuba's fidel castro , as well as instances where u .
s .
involvement has been alleged but not proven ( such as syria in *num* ) .
in *num* the cia , working with the british government , initiated " operation ajax " against the prime minister of iran mohammad mossadegh who had attempted to nationalize iran's oil , threatening the interests of the anglo-persian oil company .
this had the effect of restoring and strengthening the authoritarian monarchical reign of shah mohammad reza pahlavi .
in *num* , the cia and israeli mossad aided the iranian government in establishing its intelligence service , savak , later blamed for the torture and execution of the regime's opponents .
a year later , in " operation pbsuccess " , the cia assisted the local military in toppling the democratically elected left-wing government of jacobo árbenz in guatemala and installing the military dictator carlos castillo armas .
the united fruit company lobbied for árbenz overthrow as his land reforms jeopardized their land holdings in guatemala , and painted these reforms as a communist threat .
the coup triggered a decades long civil war which claimed the lives of an estimated *num* , *num* people ( *num* , *num* individual cases have been documented ) , mostly through *num* massacres against the maya population perpetrated by the u .
s .
-backed guatemalan military .
an independent historical clarification commission found that u .
s .
corporations and government officials " exercised pressure to maintain the country's archaic and unjust socio-economic structure , " and that u .
s .
military assistance had a " significant bearing on human rights violations during the armed confrontation .
" during the massacre of at least *num* , *num* alleged communists in 1960s indonesia , u .
s .
government officials encouraged and applauded the mass killings while providing covert assistance to the indonesian military which helped facilitate them .
this included the u .
s .
embassy in jakarta supplying indonesian forces with lists of up to *num* , *num* names of suspected members of the communist party of indonesia ( pki ) , who were subsequently killed in the massacres .
in *num* , the cia attempted to prevent the publication of the state department volume " foreign relations of the united states , 1964–1968 " , which documents the u .
s .
role in providing covert assistance to the indonesian military for the express purpose of the extirpation of the pki .
in july *num* , an international panel of judges ruled the killings constitute crimes against humanity , and that the us , along with other western governments , were complicit in these crimes .
in *num* , the cia worked with coup-plotters in chile in the attempted kidnapping of general rené schneider , who was targeted for refusing to participate in a military coup upon the election of salvador allende .
schneider was shot in the botched attempt and died three days later .
the cia later paid the group $35 , *num* for the failed kidnapping .
according to one peer-reviewed study , the u .
s .
intervened in *num* foreign elections between *num* and *num* , while the soviet union or russia intervened in *num* .
since the 1970s , issues of human rights have become increasingly important in american foreign policy .
congress took the lead in the 1970s .
following the vietnam war , the feeling that u .
s .
foreign policy had grown apart from traditional american values was seized upon by senator donald m .
fraser ( d , mi ) , leading the subcommittee on international organizations and movements , in criticizing republican foreign policy under the nixon administration .
in the early 1970s , congress concluded the vietnam war and passed the war powers act .
as " part of a growing assertiveness by congress about many aspects of foreign policy , " human rights concerns became a battleground between the legislative and the executive branches in the formulation of foreign policy .
david forsythe points to three specific , early examples of congress interjecting its own thoughts on foreign policy : these measures were repeatedly used by congress , with varying success , to affect u .
s .
foreign policy towards the inclusion of human rights concerns .
specific examples include el salvador , nicaragua , guatemala and south africa .
the executive ( from nixon to reagan ) argued that the cold war required placing regional security in favor of u .
s .
interests over any behavioral concerns of national allies .
congress argued the opposite , in favor of distancing the united states from oppressive regimes .
nevertheless , according to historian daniel goldhagen , during the last two decades of the cold war , the number of american client states practicing mass murder outnumbered those of the soviet union .
john henry coatsworth , a historian of latin america and the provost of columbia university , suggests the number of repression victims in latin america alone far surpassed that of the ussr and its east european satellites during the period *num* to *num* .
w .
john green contends that the united states was an " essential enabler " of " latin america's political murder habit , bringing out and allowing to flourish some of the region's worst tendencies .
" on december *num* , *num* , obama instructed agencies to consider lgbt rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries .
he also criticized russia's law discriminating against gays , joining other western leaders in the boycott of the *num* winter olympics in russia .
in june *num* , a chilean court ruled that the united states played a key role in the murders of charles horman and frank teruggi , both american citizens , shortly after the *num* chilean coup d'état .
united states foreign policy is influenced by the efforts of the u .
s .
government to control imports of illicit drugs , including cocaine , heroin , methamphetamine , and cannabis .
this is especially true in latin america , a focus for the u .
s .
war on drugs .
those efforts date back to at least *num* , when the u .
s .
and china completed an agreement that prohibited the shipment of opium between the two countries .
over a century later , the foreign relations authorization act requires the president to identify the major drug transit or major illicit drug-producing countries .
in september *num* , the following countries were identified : bahamas , bolivia , brazil , burma , colombia , dominican republic , ecuador , guatemala , haiti , india , jamaica , laos , mexico , nigeria , pakistan , panama , paraguay , peru and venezuela .
two of these , burma and venezuela are countries that the u .
s .
considers to have failed to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements during the previous *num* months .
notably absent from the *num* list were afghanistan , the people's republic of china and vietnam ; canada was also omitted in spite of evidence that criminal groups there are increasingly involved in the production of mdma destined for the united states and that large-scale cross-border trafficking of canadian-grown cannabis continues .
the u .
s .
believes that the netherlands are successfully countering the production and flow of mdma to the u .
s .
critics from the left cite episodes that undercut leftist governments or showed support for israel .
others cite human rights abuses and violations of international law .
critics have charged that the u .
s .
presidents have used democracy to justify military intervention abroad .
critics also point to declassified records which indicate that the cia under allen dulles and the fbi under j .
edgar hoover aggressively recruited more than *num* , *num* nazis , including those responsible for war crimes , to use as spies and informants against the soviet union in the cold war .
the u .
s .
has faced criticism for backing right-wing dictators that systematically violated human rights , such as augusto pinochet of chile , alfredo stroessner of paraguay , efraín ríos montt of guatemala , jorge rafael videla of argentina , hissène habré of chad yahya khan of pakistan and suharto of indonesia .
critics have also accused the united states of facilitating and supporting state terrorism in the global south during the cold war , such as operation " condor " , an international campaign of political assassination and state terror organized by right-wing military dictatorships in the southern cone of south america .
journalists and human rights organizations have been critical of us-led airstrikes and targeted killings by drones which have in some cases resulted in collateral damage of civilian populations .
in early *num* , the u .
s .
faced criticism from some scholars , activists and media outlets for dropping *num* , *num* bombs on seven different countries throughout *num* : syria , iraq , afghanistan , libya , yemen , somalia and pakistan .
the u .
s .
has been accused of complicity in war crimes for backing the saudi arabian-led intervention into the yemeni civil war ( 2015–present ) , which has triggered a humanitarian catastrophe , including a cholera outbreak and millions facing starvation .
studies have been devoted to the historical success rate of the u .
s .
in exporting democracy abroad .
some studies of american intervention have been pessimistic about the overall effectiveness of u .
s .
efforts to encourage democracy in foreign nations .
some scholars have generally agreed with international relations professor abraham lowenthal that u .
s .
attempts to export democracy have been " negligible , often counterproductive , and only occasionally positive .
" other studies find u .
s .
intervention has had mixed results , and another by hermann and kegley has found that military interventions have improved democracy in other countries .
a *num* global poll in *num* countries with *num* , *num* respondents by win / gallup found that the u .
s .
is perceived as the biggest threat to world peace .
regarding support for certain anti-communist dictatorships during the cold war , a response is that they were seen as a necessary evil , with the alternatives even worse communist or fundamentalist dictatorships .
david schmitz says this policy did not serve u .
s .
interests .
friendly tyrants resisted necessary reforms and destroyed the political center ( though not in south korea ) , while the ' realist ' policy of coddling dictators brought a backlash among foreign populations with long memories .
many democracies have voluntary military ties with united states .
see nato , anzus , treaty of mutual cooperation and security between the united states and japan , mutual defense treaty with south korea , and major non-nato ally .
those nations with military alliances with the u .
s .
can spend less on the military since they can count on u .
s .
protection .
this may give a false impression that the u .
s .
is less peaceful than those nations .
research on the democratic peace theory has generally found that democracies , including the united states , have not made war on one another .
there have been u .
s .
support for coups against some democracies , but for example spencer r .
weart argues that part of the explanation was the perception , correct or not , that these states were turning into communist dictatorships .
also important was the role of rarely transparent united states government agencies , who sometimes mislead or did not fully implement the decisions of elected civilian leaders .
empirical studies ( see democide ) have found that democracies , including the united states , have killed much fewer civilians than dictatorships .
media may be biased against the u .
s .
regarding reporting human rights violations .
studies have found that " the new york times " coverage of worldwide human rights violations predominantly focuses on the human rights violations in nations where there is clear u .
s .
involvement , while having relatively little coverage of the human rights violations in other nations .
for example , the bloodiest war in recent time , involving eight nations and killing millions of civilians , was the second congo war , which was almost completely ignored by the media .
niall ferguson argues that the u .
s .
is incorrectly blamed for all the human rights violations in nations they have supported .
he writes that it is generally agreed that guatemala was the worst of the us-backed regimes during the cold war .
however , the u .
s .
cannot credibly be blamed for all the *num* , *num* deaths during the long guatemalan civil war .
the u .
s .
intelligence oversight board writes that military aid was cut for long periods because of such violations , that the u .
s .
helped stop a coup in *num* , and that efforts were made to improve the conduct of the security services .
today the u .
s .
states that democratic nations best support u .
s .
national interests .
according to the u .
s .
state department , " democracy is the one national interest that helps to secure all the others .
democratically governed nations are more likely to secure the peace , deter aggression , expand open markets , promote economic development , protect american citizens , combat international terrorism and crime , uphold human and worker rights , avoid humanitarian crises and refugee flows , improve the global environment , and protect human health .
" according to former u .
s .
president bill clinton , " ultimately , the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere .
democracies don't attack each other .
" in one view mentioned by the u .
s .
state department , democracy is also good for business .
countries that embrace political reforms are also more likely to pursue economic reforms that improve the productivity of businesses .
accordingly , since the mid-1980s , under president ronald reagan , there has been an increase in levels of foreign direct investment going to emerging market democracies relative to countries that have not undertaken political reforms .
leaked cables in *num* suggested that the " dark shadow of terrorism still dominates the united states ' relations with the world " .
french republican calendar the french republican calendar ( ) , also commonly called the french revolutionary calendar ( " calendrier révolutionnaire français " ) , was a calendar created and implemented during the french revolution , and used by the french government for about *num* years from late *num* to *num* , and for *num* days by the paris commune in *num* .
the revolutionary system was designed in part to remove all religious and royalist influences from the calendar , and was part of a larger attempt at decimalisation in france ( which also included decimal time of day , decimalisation of currency , and metrication ) .
it was used in government records in france and other areas under french rule , including belgium , luxembourg , and parts of the netherlands , germany , switzerland , malta , and italy .
sylvain maréchal , prominent anticlerical atheist , published the first edition of his " almanach des honnêtes-gens " ( almanac of honest people ) in *num* .
on pages 14–15 appears a calendar , consisting of twelve months .
the first month is " mars , ou princeps " ( march , or first ) , the last month is " février , ou duodécembre " ( february , or twelfth ) .
( the months of september [ meaning " the seventh " ] through december [ meaning " the tenth " ] are already numeric names , although their meanings do not match their positions in either the julian or the gregorian calendar since the romans added the months january and february to the original ten-month march to december year of king romulus .
) the lengths of the months are the same as the lengths given them by julius caesar ; however , the *ord* , *ord* , and *ord* are singled out of each month as the end of a " décade " ( group of ten ) .
individual days were assigned , instead of to the traditional saints , to people noteworthy for mostly secular achievements ; *num* december is assigned to both jesus and newton .
later editions of the almanac would switch to the republican calendar .
the days of the french revolution and republic saw many efforts to sweep away various trappings of the " ancien régime " ( the old feudal monarchy ) ; some of these were more successful than others .
the new republican government sought to institute , among other reforms , a new social and legal system , a new system of weights and measures ( which became the metric system ) , and a new calendar .
amid nostalgia for the ancient roman republic , the theories of the enlightenment were at their peak , and the devisers of the new systems looked to nature for their inspiration .
natural constants , multiples of ten , and latin as well as ancient greek derivations formed the fundamental blocks from which the new systems were built .
the new calendar was created by a commission under the direction of the politician charles-gilbert romme seconded by claude joseph ferry and charles-françois dupuis .
they associated with their work the chemist louis-bernard guyton de morveau , the mathematician and astronomer joseph-louis lagrange , the astronomer joseph jérôme lefrançois de lalande , the mathematician gaspard monge , the astronomer and naval geographer alexandre guy pingré , and the poet , actor and playwright fabre d'églantine , who invented the names of the months , with the help of andré thouin , gardener at the jardin des plantes of the muséum national d'histoire naturelle in paris .
as the rapporteur of the commission , charles-gilbert romme presented the new calendar to the jacobin-controlled national convention on *num* september *num* , which adopted it on *num* october *num* and also extended it proleptically to its epoch of *num* september *num* .
it is because of his position as rapporteur of the commission that the creation of the republican calendar is attributed to romme .
the calendar is frequently named the " french revolutionary calendar " because it was created during the revolution , but this is a slight misnomer .
indeed , there was initially a debate as to whether the calendar should celebrate the great revolution , which began in july *num* , or the republic , which was established in *num* .
immediately following *num* july *num* , papers and pamphlets started calling *num* year i of liberty and the following years ii and iii .
it was in *num* , with the practical problem of dating financial transactions , that the legislative assembly was confronted with the problem of the calendar .
originally , the choice of epoch was either *num* january *num* or *num* july *num* .
after some hesitation the assembly decided on *num* january *num* that all official documents would use the " era of liberty " and that the year iv of liberty started on *num* january *num* .
this usage was modified on *num* september *num* when the republic was proclaimed and the convention decided that all public documents would be dated year i of the french republic .
the decree of *num* january *num* stipulated that the year ii of the republic began on *num* january *num* ; this was revoked with the introduction of the new calendar , which set *num* september *num* as the beginning of year ii .
the establishment of the republic was used as the epochal date for the calendar ; therefore , the calendar commemorates the republic , not the revolution .
in france , it is known as the " calendrier républicain " as well as the " calendrier révolutionnaire " .
french coins of the period naturally used this calendar .
many show the year ( ) in arabic numbers , although roman numerals were used on some issues .
year *num* coins typically have a " xi " date to avoid confusion with the roman " ii " .
the french revolution is usually considered to have ended with the coup of *num* brumaire , year viii ( *num* november *num* ) , the coup d'état of napoleon bonaparte against the established constitutional regime of the " directoire " .
the concordat of *num* re-established the roman catholic church as an official institution in france , although not as the state religion of france .
the concordat took effect from easter sunday , *num* germinal , year xi ( *num* april *num* ) ; it restored the names of the days of the week to the ones from the gregorian calendar , and fixed sunday as the official day of rest and religious celebration .
however , the other attributes of the republican calendar , the months , and years , remained as they were .
the french republic ended with the coronation of napoleon i as " empereur des français " ( emperor of the french ) on *num* frimaire , year xiii ( *num* december *num* ) , but the republican calendar would remain in place for another year .
napoleon finally abolished the republican calendar with effect from *num* january *num* ( the day after *num* nivôse year xiv ) , a little over twelve years after its introduction .
it was , however , used again briefly in the " journal officiel " for some dates during a short period of the paris commune , 6–23 may *num* ( *num* floréal–3 prairial year lxxix ) .
years appear in writing as roman numerals ( usually ) , with epoch *num* september *num* , the beginning of the " republican era " ( the day the french first republic was proclaimed , one day after the convention abolished the monarchy ) .
as a result , roman numeral i indicates the first year of the republic , that is , the year before the calendar actually came into use .
by law , the beginning of each year was set at midnight , beginning on the day the apparent autumnal equinox falls at the paris observatory .
there were twelve months , each divided into three ten-day weeks called " décades " .
the tenth day , " décadi " , replaced sunday as the day of rest and festivity .
the five or six extra days needed to approximate the solar or tropical year were placed after the months at the end of each year and called complementary days .
this arrangement was an almost exact copy of the calendar used by the ancient egyptians , though in their case the beginning of the year was marked by summer solstice rather than autumn equinox .
a period of four years ending on a leap day was to be called a " franciade " .
the name " olympique " was originally proposed but changed to franciade to commemorate the fact that it had taken the revolution four years to establish a republican government in france .
the leap year was called " sextile " , an allusion to the " bissextile " leap years of the julian and gregorian calendars , because it contained a sixth complementary day .
each day in the republican calendar was divided into ten hours , each hour into *num* decimal minutes , and each decimal minute into *num* decimal seconds .
thus an hour was *num* conventional minutes ( more than twice as long as a conventional hour ) , a minute was *num* .
*num* conventional seconds ( *num* % longer than a conventional minute ) , and a second was *num* .
*num* conventional seconds ( *num* .
*num* % shorter than a conventional second ) .
clocks were manufactured to display this decimal time , but it did not catch on .
mandatory use of decimal time was officially suspended *num* april *num* , although some cities continued to use decimal time as late as *num* .
the numbering of years in the republican calendar by roman numerals ran counter to this general decimalization tendency .
the republican calendar year began the day the autumnal equinox occurred in paris , and had twelve months of *num* days each , which were given new names based on nature , principally having to do with the prevailing weather in and around paris .
note : on many printed calendars of year ii ( 1793–94 ) , the month of " thermidor " was named " fervidor " ( from latin " fervidus " , " burning hot " ) .
most of the month names were new words coined from french , latin , or greek .
the endings of the names are grouped by season .
" dor " means " giving " in greek .
in britain , a contemporary wit mocked the republican calendar by calling the months : wheezy , sneezy and freezy ; slippy , drippy and nippy ; showery , flowery and bowery ; hoppy , croppy and poppy .
the scottish historian thomas carlyle suggested somewhat more serious english names in his *num* work " " , namely vintagearious , fogarious , frostarious , snowous , rainous , windous , buddal , floweral , meadowal , reapidor , heatidor , and fruitidor .
like the french originals , they are neologisms suggesting a meaning related to the season .
the month is divided into three " décades " or " weeks " of ten days each , named simply : décades were abandoned in floréal an x ( april *num* ) .
the catholic church used a calendar of saints , which named each day of the year after an associated saint .
to reduce the influence of the church , fabre d'églantine introduced a rural calendar in which each day of the year had a unique name associated with the rural economy , stated to correspond to the time of year .
every " décadi " ( ending in *num* ) was named after an agricultural tool .
each " quintidi " ( ending in *num* ) was named for a common animal .
the rest of the days were named for " grain , pasture , trees , roots , flowers , fruits " and other plants , except for the first month of winter , nivôse , during which the rest of the days were named after minerals .
five extra days – six in leap years – were national holidays at the end of every year .
these were originally known as " les sans-culottides " ( after " sans-culottes " ) , but after year iii ( *num* ) as " les jours complémentaires " : below are the gregorian dates each republican year ( " an " in french ) began while the calendar was in effect .
the calendar was abolished in the year xiv ( *num* ) .
after this date , opinions seem to differ on the method by which the leap years would have been determined if the calendar were still in force .
there are at least four hypotheses used to convert dates from the gregorian calendar : the following table shows when several years of the republican era begin on the gregorian calendar , according to each of the four above methods : for this calendar , the romme method of calculating leap years is used .
other methods may differ by one day .
time may be cached and therefore not accurate .
decimal time is according to paris mean time , which is *num* minutes *num* seconds ( *num* .
*num* decimal minutes ) ahead of greenwich mean time .
leap years in the calendar are a point of great dispute , due to the contradicting statements in the establishing decree stating : and : these two specifications are incompatible , as leap years defined by the autumnal equinox in paris do not recur on a regular four-year schedule .
thus , the years iii , vii , and xi were observed as leap years , and the years xv and xx were also planned as such , even though they were five years apart .
a fixed arithmetic rule for determining leap years was proposed in the name of the committee of public education by gilbert romme on *num* floréal an iii ( *num* may *num* ) .
the proposed rule was to determine leap years by applying the rules of the gregorian calendar to the years of the french republic ( years iv , viii , xii , etc .
were to be leap years ) except that year *num* ( the last year of ten 400-year periods ) should be a common year instead of a leap year .
shortly thereafter , he was sentenced to the guillotine , and his proposal was never adopted and the original astronomical rule continued , which excluded any other fixed arithmetic rule .
the proposal was intended to avoid uncertain future leap years caused by the inaccurate astronomical knowledge of the 1790s ( even today , this statement is still valid due to the uncertainty in δt ) .
in particular , the committee noted that the autumnal equinox of year *num* was predicted to occur at *num* : *num* : *num* pm local apparent time in paris , which was closer to midnight than its inherent *num* to *num* minute uncertainty .
the calendar was abolished by an act dated *num* fructidor an xiii ( *num* september *num* ) and signed by napoleon , which referred to a report by michel-louis-étienne regnaud de saint-jean d'angély and jean joseph mounier , listing two fundamental flaws .
the report also noted that the 10-day décade was unpopular and had already been suppressed three years earlier in favor of the 7-day week , removing what was considered by some as one of the calendar's main benefits .
the 10-day décade was unpopular with laborers because they received only one full day of rest out of ten , instead of one in seven , although they also got a half-day off on the fifth day .
it also , by design , conflicted with sunday religious observances .
another criticism of the calendar was that despite the poetic names of its months , they are tied to the climate and agriculture of metropolitan france and therefore not applicable to france's overseas territories .
the " *num* brumaire " or " brumaire " was the coup d'état of napoleon bonaparte on *num* brumaire an viii ( *num* november *num* ) , which many historians consider as the end of the french revolution .
karl marx's *num* essay " the *ord* brumaire of louis napoleon " compares the *num* coup of louis napoleon to his uncle's earlier coup .
another famous revolutionary date is *num* thermidor an ii ( *num* july *num* ) , the date the convention turned against robespierre , who , along with others associated with the mountain , was guillotined the following day .
based on this event , the term " thermidorian " entered the marxist vocabulary as referring to revolutionaries who destroy the revolution from the inside and turn against its true aims .
for example , leon trotsky and his followers used this term about joseph stalin .
émile zola's novel " germinal " takes its name from the calendar's month of germinal .
the seafood dish lobster thermidor was probably named after the *num* play " thermidor " , set during the revolution .
the french frigates of the " floréal " class all bear names of republican months .
the convention of *num* brumaire an iii , *num* october *num* , established the école normale supérieure .
the date appears prominently on the entrance to the school .
the french composer fromental halévy was named after the feast day of ' fromental ' in the revolutionary calendar , which occurred on his birthday in year viii ( *num* may *num* ) .
neil gaiman's " the sandman " series included a story called " thermidor " that takes place in that month during the french revolution .
the " liavek " shared world series uses a calendar that is a direct translation of the french republican calendar .
sarah monette's " doctrine of labyrinths " series borrows the republican calendar for one of the two competing calendars ( their usage splits between social classes ) in the fictional city of mélusine .
jacques rivette's *num* film " celine and julie go boating " refers to the calendar and its hours of the day .
alain tanner's *num* film " messidor " presents a haphazard summer road trip of two young women in switzerland .
alfred hitchcock sir alfred joseph hitchcock ( *num* august *num* – *num* april *num* ) was an english film director and producer , widely regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema .
known as " the master of suspense " , he directed over *num* feature films in a career spanning six decades , becoming as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews , his cameo roles in most of his films , and his hosting and producing of the television anthology " alfred hitchcock presents " ( 1955–1965 ) .
born in leytonstone , essex , hitchcock entered the film industry in *num* as a title card designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph-cable company .
he made his directorial debut with the silent film " the pleasure garden " ( *num* ) .
his first successful film , " " ( *num* ) , helped to shape the thriller genre , while his *num* film , " blackmail " , was the first british " " .
two of his 1930s thrillers , " the *num* steps " ( *num* ) and " the lady vanishes " ( *num* ) , are ranked among the greatest british films of the *ord* century .
by *num* hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance , and film producer david o .
selznick persuaded him to move to hollywood .
a string of successful films followed , including " rebecca " ( *num* ) , " foreign correspondent " ( *num* ) , " shadow of a doubt " ( *num* ) , and " the paradine case " ( *num* ) ; " rebecca " was nominated for *num* oscars and won the academy award for best picture .
his *num* films have grossed over us$223 .
*num* million worldwide and garnered a total of *num* oscar nominations and six wins .
the " hitchcockian " style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze , thereby turning viewers into voyeurs , and framing shots to maximise anxiety and fear .
the film critic robin wood wrote that the meaning of a hitchcock film " is there in the method , in the progression from shot to shot .
a hitchcock film is an organism , with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole .
" by *num* hitchcock had directed four films often ranked among the greatest of all time : " rear window " ( *num* ) , " vertigo " ( *num* ) , " north by northwest " ( *num* ) , and " psycho " ( *num* ) .
in *num* " vertigo " replaced orson welles's " citizen kane " ( *num* ) as the british film institute's greatest film ever made .
by *num* eight of his films had been selected for preservation in the united states national film registry , including his personal favourite , " shadow of a doubt " ( *num* ) .
he received the afi life achievement award in *num* and was knighted in december that year , four months before he died .
hitchcock was born in the flat above his parents ' leased grocer's shop at *num* high road , leytonstone , on the outskirts of east london ( then part of essex ) , the youngest of three children : william ( born *num* ) , ellen kathleen ( " nellie " ) ( *num* ) , and alfred joseph ( *num* ) .
his parents , emma jane hitchcock , née whelan ( 1863–1942 ) , and william hitchcock ( 1862–1914 ) , were both roman catholics , with partial roots in ireland ; william was a greengrocer as his father had been .
there was a large extended family , including uncle john hitchcock with his five-bedroom victorian house on campion road , putney , complete with maid , cook , chauffeur and gardener .
every summer john rented a seaside house for the family in cliftonville , kent .
hitchcock said that he first became class-conscious there , noticing the differences between tourists and locals .
describing himself as a well-behaved boy—his father called him his " little lamb without a spot"—hitchcock said he could not remember ever having had a playmate .
one of his favourite stories for interviewers was about his father sending him to the local police station with a note when he was five ; the policeman looked at the note and locked him in a cell for a few minutes , saying , " this is what we do to naughty boys .
" the experience left him , he said , with a lifelong fear of policemen ; in *num* he told tom snyder that he was " scared stiff of anything .
.
.
to do with the law " and wouldn't even drive a car in case he got a parking ticket .
when he was six , the family moved to limehouse and leased two stores at *num* and *num* salmon lane , which they ran as a fish-and-chips shop and fishmongers ' respectively ; they lived above the former .
it seems that hitchcock was seven when he attended his first school , the howrah house convent in poplar , which he entered in *num* .
according to patrick mcgilligan , he stayed at howrah house for at most two years .
he also attended a convent school , the wode street school " for the daughters of gentlemen and little boys " , run by the faithful companions of jesus ; briefly attended a primary school near his home ; and was for a very short time , when he was nine , a boarder at salesian college in battersea .
the family moved again when he was *num* , this time to stepney , and on *num* october *num* hitchcock was sent to st ignatius college in stamford hill , tottenham ( now in the london borough of haringey ) , a jesuit grammar school with a reputation for discipline .
the priests used a hard rubber cane on the boys , always at the end of the day , so the boys had to sit through classes anticipating the punishment once they knew they'd been written up for it .
he said it was here that he developed his sense of fear .
the school register lists his year of birth as *num* rather than *num* ; spoto writes that it seems he was deliberately enrolled as a 10-year-old , perhaps because he was a year behind with his schooling .
while biographer gene adair reports that hitchcock was " an average , or slightly above-average , pupil " , hitchcock said he was " usually among the four or five at the top of the class " ; at the end of his first year , his work in latin , english , french and religious education was noted .
his favourite subject was geography , and he became interested in maps , and railway and bus timetables ; according to taylor , he could recite all the stops on the orient express .
he told peter bogdanovich : " the jesuits taught me organization , control and , to some degree , analysis .
" hitchcock told his parents that he wanted to be an engineer , and on *num* july *num* , he left st ignatius and enrolled in night classes at the london county council school of engineering and navigation in poplar .
in a book-length interview in *num* , he told françois truffaut that he had studied " mechanics , electricity , acoustics , and navigation " .
then on *num* december *num* his father , who had been suffering from emphysema and kidney disease , died at the age of *num* .
to support himself and his mother—his older siblings had left home by then—hitchcock took a job , for *num* shillings a week ( £ in *num* ) , as a technical clerk at the henley telegraph and cable company in blomfield street near london wall .
he kept up his night classes , this time in art history , painting , economics , and political science .
his older brother ran the family shops , while he and his mother continued to live in salmon lane .
hitchcock was too young to enlist when the first world war broke out in july *num* , and when he reached the required age of *num* in *num* , he received a c3 classification ( " free from serious organic disease , able to stand service conditions in garrisons at home .
.
.
only suitable for sedentary work " ) .
he joined a cadet regiment of the royal engineers and took part in theoretical briefings , weekend drills , and exercises .
john russell taylor wrote that , in one session of practical exercises in hyde park , hitchcock was required to wear puttees .
he could never master wrapping them around his legs , and they repeatedly fell down around his ankles .
after the war , hitchcock began dabbling in creative writing .
in june *num* he became a founding editor and business manager of henley's in-house publication , " the henley telegraph " ( sixpence a copy ) , to which he submitted several short stories .
henley's promoted him to the advertising department , where he wrote copy and drew graphics for advertisements for electric cable .
he apparently loved the job and would stay late at the office to examine the proofs ; he told truffaut that this was his " first step toward cinema " .
he enjoyed watching films , especially american cinema , and from the age of *num* read the trade papers ; he watched charlie chaplin , d .
w .
griffith and buster keaton , and particularly liked fritz lang's " der müde tod " ( *num* ) .
while still at henley's , he read in a trade paper that famous players-lasky , the production arm of paramount pictures , was opening a studio in london .
they were planning to film " the sorrows of satan " by marie corelli , so he produced some drawings for the title cards and sent his work to the studio .
they hired him , and in *num* he began working for islington studios in poole street , hoxton , as a title-card designer .
donald spoto writes that most of the staff were americans with strict job specifications , but the english workers were encouraged to try their hand at anything , which meant that hitchcock gained experience as a co-writer , art director and production manager on at least *num* silent films .
" the times " wrote in february *num* about the studio's " special art title department under the supervision of mr .
a .
j .
hitchcock " .
his work there included " number *num* " ( *num* ) , also known as " mrs .
peabody " , cancelled because of financial problems—the few finished scenes are lost—and " always tell your wife " ( *num* ) , which he and seymour hicks finished together when hicks was about to give up on it .
hicks wrote later about being helped by " a fat youth who was in charge of the property room .
.
.
[ n ] one other than alfred hitchcock " .
when paramount pulled out of london in *num* , hitchcock was hired as an assistant director by a new firm run in the same location by michael balcon , later known as gainsborough pictures .
hitchcock worked on " woman to woman " ( *num* ) with the director graham cutts , designing the set , writing the script and producing .
he said : " it was the first film that i had really got my hands onto .
" the editor and " script girl " on " woman to woman " was alma reville , his future wife .
he also worked as an assistant to cutts on " the white shadow " ( *num* ) , " the passionate adventure " ( *num* ) , " the blackguard " ( *num* ) , and " the prude's fall " ( *num* ) .
" the blackguard " was produced at the babelsberg studios in potsdam , where hitchcock watched part of the making of f .
w .
murnau's film " the last laugh " ( *num* ) .
he was impressed with murnau's work and later used many of his techniques for the set design in his own productions .
in the summer of *num* , balcon asked hitchcock to direct " the pleasure garden " ( *num* ) , starring virginia valli , a co-production of gainsborough and the german firm emelka at the geiselgasteig studio near munich .
reville , by then hitchcock's fiancée , was assistant director-editor .
although the film was a commercial flop , balcon liked hitchcock's work ; a " daily express " headline called him , " young man with a master mind " .
balcon asked him to direct a second film in munich , " the mountain eagle " ( *num* ) , released in the united states as " fear o ' god " .
the film is lost ; hitchcock called it " a very bad movie " .
hitchcock's luck changed with his first thriller , " " ( *num* ) , about the hunt for a serial killer who , wearing a black cloak and carrying a black bag , is murdering young blonde women in london , and only on tuesdays .
a landlady suspects that her lodger is the killer , but he turns out to be innocent .
to convey that footsteps were being heard from an upper floor , hitchcock had a glass floor made so that the audience could see the lodger pacing up and down in his room above the landlady .
hitchcock had wanted the leading man to be guilty , or for the film at least to end ambiguously , but the star was ivor novello , a matinée idol , and the " star system " meant that novello could not be the villain .
hitchcock told truffaut : " you have to clearly spell it out in big letters : ' he is innocent .
' " ( he had the same problem years later with cary grant in " suspicion " ( *num* ) .
) released in january *num* , " the lodger " was a commercial and critical success in the uk .
hitchcock told truffaut that the film was the first of his to be influenced by the expressionist techniques he had witnessed in germany : " in truth , you might almost say that " the lodger " was my first picture .
" he made his first cameo appearances in the film , purely because an extra body was needed , sitting in a newsroom and later standing in a crowd as the leading man is arrested .
on *num* december *num* , hitchcock and alma reville ( 1899–1982 ) married at the brompton oratory in south kensington .
the couple honeymooned in paris , lake como and st .
moritz , before returning to london to live in a leased flat on the top two floors of *num* cromwell road , kensington .
reville , who was born just hours after hitchcock , converted from protestantism to catholicism , apparently at the insistence of hitchcock's mother ; she was baptized on *num* may *num* and confirmed at westminster cathedral by cardinal francis bourne on *num* june .
in *num* , when they learned that she was pregnant , the hitchcocks purchased " winter's grace " , a tudor farmhouse set in *num* acres on stroud lane , shamley green , surrey , for £2 , *num* .
their daughter and only child , patricia alma hitchcock , was born on *num* july that year .
reville became her husband's closest collaborator ; charles champlin wrote in *num* : " the hitchcock touch had four hands , and two were alma's .
" hitchcock began work on his tenth film , " blackmail " ( *num* ) , when its production company , british international pictures ( bip ) , converted its elstree studios to sound .
the film was the first british " " ; it followed the first american sound feature film , " the jazz singer " ( *num* ) .
" blackmail " began the hitchcock tradition of using famous landmarks as a backdrop for suspense sequences , with the climax taking place on the dome of the british museum .
it also features one of his longest cameo appearances , which shows him being bothered by a small boy as he reads a book on the london underground .
in the pbs series " the men who made the movies " , hitchcock explained how he used early sound recording as a special element of the film , stressing the word " knife " in a conversation with the woman suspected of murder .
during this period , hitchcock directed segments for a bip revue , " elstree calling " ( *num* ) , and directed a short film , " an elastic affair " ( *num* ) , featuring two " film weekly " scholarship winners .
" an elastic affair " is one of the lost films .
in *num* hitchcock was once again working for michael balcon at gaumont british .
his first film for the company , " the man who knew too much " ( *num* ) , was a success ; his second , " the *num* steps " ( *num* ) , was acclaimed in the uk and made hitchcock a star in the us .
it also established the quintessential english " hitchcock blonde " ( madeleine carroll ) as the template for his succession of ice-cold , elegant leading ladies .
screenwriter robert towne remarked , " it's not much of an exaggeration to say that all contemporary escapist entertainment begins with " the *num* steps" " .
this film was one of the first to introduce the " macguffin " plot device , a term coined by the english screenwriter angus macphail .
the macguffin is an item or goal the protagonist is pursuing , one that otherwise has no narrative value ; in " the *num* steps " , the macguffin is a stolen set of design plans .
hitchcock released two spy thrillers in *num* .
" sabotage " was loosely based on joseph conrad's novel , " the secret agent " ( *num* ) , about a woman who discovers that her husband is a terrorist , and " secret agent " , based on two stories in " " ( *num* ) by w .
somerset maugham .
at this time , hitchcock also became notorious for pranks against the cast and crew .
these jokes ranged from simple and innocent to crazy and maniacal .
for instance , he hosted a dinner party where he dyed all the food blue because , as he claimed , there weren't enough blue foods .
he also had a horse delivered to the dressing room of his friend , actor sir gerald du maurier .
hitchcock's next major success was " the lady vanishes " ( *num* ) , " one of the greatest train movies from the genre's golden era " , according to philip french , in which miss froy ( may whitty ) , a british spy posing as a governess , disappears on a train journey through the fictional european country of bandrika .
the film saw hitchcock receive the *num* new york film critics circle award for best director , the only time he won an award for his direction .
benjamin crisler , the " new york times " film critic , wrote in june *num* : " three unique and valuable institutions the british have that we in america have not : magna carta , the tower bridge and alfred hitchcock , the greatest director of screen melodramas in the world .
" david o .
selznick signed hitchcock to a seven-year contract beginning in march *num* , and the hitchcocks moved to hollywood .
in june that year " life " magazine called him the " greatest master of melodrama in screen history " .
the working arrangements with selznick were less than ideal .
selznick suffered from constant financial problems , and hitchcock was often unhappy about selznick's creative control over his films .
in a later interview , hitchcock said : " [ selznick ] was the big producer .
.
.
.
producer was king .
the most flattering thing mr .
selznick ever said about me—and it shows you the amount of control—he said i was the ' only director ' he'd ' trust with a film ' .
" at the same time , selznick complained about hitchcock's " goddamn jigsaw cutting " , which meant that the producer had to follow hitchcock's vision of the finished product .
selznick lent hitchcock to the larger studios more often than producing hitchcock's films himself .
selznick made only a few films each year , as did fellow independent producer samuel goldwyn , so he did not always have projects for hitchcock to direct .
goldwyn had also negotiated with hitchcock on a possible contract , only to be outbid by selznick .
hitchcock was quickly impressed by the superior resources of the american studios compared to the financial limits he had often faced in britain .
the selznick picture " rebecca " ( *num* ) was hitchcock's first american film , set in a hollywood version of england's cornwall and based on a novel by english novelist daphne du maurier .
the film stars laurence olivier and joan fontaine .
the story concerns a naïve ( and unnamed ) young woman who marries a widowed aristocrat .
she goes to live in his huge english country house , and struggles with the lingering reputation of his elegant and worldly first wife rebecca , who died under mysterious circumstances .
the film won best picture at the *ord* academy awards ; the statuette was given to selznick , as the film's producer .
hitchcock was nominated for best director , his first of five such nominations .
hitchcock's second american film was the thriller " foreign correspondent " ( *num* ) , set in europe , based on vincent sheean's book " personal history " ( *num* ) and produced by walter wanger .
it was nominated for best picture that year .
hitchcock felt uneasy living and working in hollywood while his country was at war ; his concern resulted in a film that overtly supported the british war effort .
filmed in the first year of the second world war , it was inspired by the rapidly changing events in europe , as covered by an american newspaper reporter played by joel mccrea .
mixing footage of european scenes with scenes filmed on a hollywood backlot , the film avoided direct references to nazism , nazi germany , and germans to comply with hollywood's motion picture production code censorship at the time .
in september *num* the hitchcocks bought the cornwall ranch near scotts valley , california , in the santa cruz mountains .
their primary residence was an english-style home in bel air , purchased in *num* .
hitchcock's films were diverse during this period , ranging from the romantic comedy " mr .
& mrs .
smith " ( *num* ) to the bleak film noir " shadow of a doubt " ( *num* ) .
"suspicion " ( *num* ) marked hitchcock's first film as a producer and director .
it is set in england ; hitchcock used the north coast of santa cruz for the english coastline sequence .
the film is the first of four projects on which cary grant worked with hitchcock , and it is one of the rare occasions that grant was cast in a sinister role .
grant plays johnnie aysgarth , an english con man whose actions raise suspicion and anxiety in his shy young english wife , lina mclaidlaw ( joan fontaine ) .
in one scene hitchcock placed a light inside a glass of milk , perhaps poisoned , that grant is bringing to his wife ; the light makes sure that the audience's attention is on the glass .
grant's character is a killer in the book on which the film was based , " before the fact " by francis iles , but the studio felt that grant's image would be tarnished by that .
hitchcock therefore settled for an ambiguous finale , although , as he told françois truffaut , he would have preferred to end with the wife's murder .
fontaine won best actress for her performance .
"saboteur " ( *num* ) is the first of two films that hitchcock made for universal during the decade .
hitchcock was forced by universal studios to use universal contract player robert cummings and priscilla lane , a freelancer who signed a one-picture deal with universal , both known for their work in comedies and light dramas .
breaking with hollywood conventions of the time , hitchcock did extensive location filming , especially in new york city , and depicted a confrontation between a suspected saboteur ( cummings ) and a real saboteur ( norman lloyd ) atop the statue of liberty .
he also directed " have you heard ? " ( *num* ) , a photographic dramatisation for " life " magazine of the dangers of rumours during wartime .
in *num* he wrote a mystery story for " look " magazine , " the murder of monty woolley " , a sequence of captioned photographs inviting the reader to find clues to the murderer's identity ; hitchcock cast the performers as themselves , such as woolley , doris merrick , and make-up man guy pearce .
"shadow of a doubt " ( *num* ) was hitchcock's personal favourite and the second of the early universal films .
charlotte " charlie " newton ( teresa wright ) suspects her beloved uncle charlie oakley ( joseph cotten ) of being a serial killer .
hitchcock again filmed extensively on location , this time in the northern california city of santa rosa .
working at *ord* century fox , hitchcock adapted a script of john steinbeck's , which recorded the experiences of the survivors of a german u-boat attack in the film " lifeboat " ( *num* ) .
the action sequences were shot in a small boat in the studio water tank .
the locale posed problems for hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance .
that was solved by having hitchcock's image appear in a newspaper that william bendix is reading in the boat , showing the director in a before-and-after advertisement for " reduco-obesity slayer " .
he told truffaut in *num* : hitchcock's typical dinner before the weight loss had been a roast chicken , boiled ham , potatoes , bread , vegetables , relishes , salad , dessert , a bottle of wine and some brandy .
to lose weight , he stopped drinking , drank black coffee for breakfast and lunch , and ate steak and salad for dinner , but it was hard to maintain ; spoto writes that his weight fluctuated considerably over the next *num* years .
at the end of *num* , despite the weight loss , the occidental insurance company of los angeles refused him life insurance .
hitchcock returned to the uk for an extended visit in late *num* and early *num* .
while there he made two short propaganda films , " bon voyage " ( *num* ) and " aventure malgache " ( *num* ) , for the ministry of information .
in june and july *num* hitchcock served as " treatment advisor " on a holocaust documentary that used allied forces footage of the liberation of nazi concentration camps .
the film was assembled in london and produced by sidney bernstein of the ministry of information , who brought hitchcock ( a friend of his ) on board .
it was originally intended to be broadcast to the germans , but the british government deemed it too traumatic to be shown to a shocked post-war population .
instead , it was transferred in *num* from the british war office film vaults to london's imperial war museum and remained unreleased until *num* , when an edited version was broadcast as an episode of pbs " frontline " , under the title the imperial war museum had given it : " memory of the camps " .
the full-length version of the film , " german concentration camps factual survey " , was restored in *num* by scholars at the imperial war museum .
hitchcock worked for david selznick again when he directed " spellbound " ( *num* ) , which explores psychoanalysis and features a dream sequence designed by salvador dalí .
the dream sequence as it appears in the film is ten minutes shorter than was originally envisioned ; selznick edited it to make it " play " more effectively .
gregory peck plays amnesiac dr .
anthony edwardes under the treatment of analyst dr .
peterson ( ingrid bergman ) , who falls in love with him while trying to unlock his repressed past .
two point-of-view shots were achieved by building a large wooden hand ( which would appear to belong to the character whose point of view the camera took ) and out-sized props for it to hold : a bucket-sized glass of milk and a large wooden gun .
for added novelty and impact , the climactic gunshot was hand-coloured red on some copies of the black-and-white film .
the original musical score by miklós rózsa makes use of the theremin , and some of it was later adapted by the composer into rozsa's piano concerto op .
*num* ( *num* ) for piano and orchestra .
"notorious " ( *num* ) followed " spellbound " .
hitchcock told françois truffaut that selznick had sold him , ingrid bergman , cary grant , and the screenplay by ben hecht , to rko radio pictures as a " package " for $500 , *num* ( ) because of cost overruns on selznick's " duel in the sun " ( *num* ) .
" notorious " stars bergman and grant , both hitchcock regulars , and features a plot about nazis , uranium and south america .
his prescient use of uranium as a plot device led to him being briefly placed under surveillance by the federal bureau of investigation .
according to mcgilligan , in or around march *num* hitchcock and ben hecht consulted robert millikan of the california institute of technology about the development of a uranium bomb .
selznick complained that the notion was " science fiction " , only to be confronted by the news of the detonation of two atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki in japan in august *num* .
hitchcock formed an independent production company , transatlantic pictures , with his friend sidney bernstein .
he made two films with transatlantic , one of which was his first colour film .
with " rope " ( *num* ) , hitchcock experimented with marshalling suspense in a confined environment , as he had done earlier with " lifeboat " ( *num* ) .
the film appears to have been shot in a single take , but it was actually shot in *num* takes ranging from 4- to *num* minutes each ; a 10-minute length of film was the most that a camera's film magazine could hold at the time .
some transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment .
hitchcock used those points to hide the cut , and began the next take with the camera in the same place .
the film features james stewart in the leading role , and was the first of four films that stewart made with hitchcock .
it was inspired by the leopold and loeb case of the 1920s .
the film was not well received .
"under capricorn " ( *num* ) , set in 19th-century australia , also uses the short-lived technique of long takes , but to a more limited extent .
he again used technicolor in this production , then returned to black-and-white films for several years .
transatlantic pictures became inactive after these two unsuccessful films .
hitchcock filmed " stage fright " ( *num* ) at studios in elstree , england , where he had worked during his british international pictures contract many years before .
he matched one of warner bros .
' most popular stars , jane wyman , with the expatriate german actor marlene dietrich and used several prominent british actors , including michael wilding , richard todd and alastair sim .
this was hitchcock's first proper production for warner bros .
, which had distributed " rope " and " under capricorn " , because transatlantic pictures was experiencing financial difficulties .
his film " strangers on a train " ( *num* ) was based on the novel of the same name by patricia highsmith .
hitchcock combined many elements from his preceding films .
he approached dashiell hammett to write the dialogue , but raymond chandler took over , then left over disagreements with the director .
in the film , two men casually meet , one of whom speculates on a foolproof method to murder ; he suggests that two people , each wishing to do away with someone , should each perform the other's murder .
farley granger's role was as the innocent victim of the scheme , while robert walker , previously known for " boy-next-door " roles , played the villain .
" i confess " ( *num* ) was set in quebec with montgomery clift as a catholic priest .
"i confess " was followed by three colour films starring grace kelly : " dial m for murder " ( *num* ) , " rear window " ( *num* ) , and " to catch a thief " ( *num* ) .
in " dial m for murder " , ray milland plays the villain who tries to murder his unfaithful wife ( kelly ) for her money .
she kills the hired assassin in self-defence , so milland manipulates the evidence to make it look like murder .
her lover , mark halliday ( robert cummings ) , and police inspector hubbard ( john williams ) save her from execution .
hitchcock experimented with 3d cinematography for " dial m " .
hitchcock moved to paramount pictures and filmed " rear window " ( *num* ) , starring james stewart and kelly again , as well as thelma ritter and raymond burr .
stewart's character is a photographer ( based on robert capa ) who must temporarily use a wheelchair .
out of boredom , he begins observing his neighbours across the courtyard , then becomes convinced that one of them ( raymond burr ) has murdered his wife .
stewart eventually manages to convince his policeman buddy ( wendell corey ) and his girlfriend ( kelly ) .
as with " lifeboat " and " rope " , the principal characters are depicted in confined or cramped quarters , in this case stewart's studio apartment .
hitchcock uses close-ups of stewart's face to show his character's reactions , " from the comic voyeurism directed at his neighbours to his helpless terror watching kelly and burr in the villain's apartment " .
from *num* to *num* , hitchcock was the host of the television series " alfred hitchcock presents " .
with his droll delivery , gallows humour and iconic image , the series made hitchcock a celebrity .
the title-sequence of the show pictured a minimalist caricature of his profile ( he drew it himself ; it is composed of only nine strokes ) , which his real silhouette then filled .
the series theme tune was " funeral march of a marionette " by the french composer charles gounod ( 1818–1893 ) .
his introductions always included some sort of wry humour , such as the description of a recent multi-person execution hampered by having only one electric chair , while two are shown with a sign " two chairs—no waiting ! " he directed *num* episodes of the series , which aired from *num* to *num* .
it became " the alfred hitchcock hour " in *num* , and nbc broadcast the final episode on *num* may *num* .
in the 1980s , a new version of " alfred hitchcock presents " was produced for television , making use of hitchcock's original introductions in a colourised form .
in *num* hitchcock became a united states citizen .
the same year , his third grace kelly film , " to catch a thief " , was released ; it is set in the french riviera , and pairs kelly with cary grant .
grant plays retired thief john robie , who becomes the prime suspect for a spate of robberies in the riviera .
a thrill-seeking american heiress played by kelly surmises his true identity and tries to seduce him .
" despite the obvious age disparity between grant and kelly and a lightweight plot , the witty script ( loaded with double entendres ) and the good-natured acting proved a commercial success .
" it was hitchcock's last film with kelly .
she married prince rainier of monaco in *num* , and ended her film career .
hitchcock then remade his own *num* film " the man who knew too much " in *num* .
this time , the film starred james stewart and doris day , who sang the theme song " que sera , sera " , which won the oscar for best original song and became a big hit for her .
they play a couple whose son is kidnapped to prevent them from interfering with an assassination .
as in the *num* film , the climax takes place at the royal albert hall , london .
"the wrong man " ( *num* ) , hitchcock's final film for warner bros .
, is a low-key black-and-white production based on a real-life case of mistaken identity reported in " life " magazine in *num* .
this was the only film of hitchcock to star henry fonda , playing a stork club musician mistaken for a liquor store thief , who is arrested and tried for robbery while his wife ( vera miles ) emotionally collapses under the strain .
hitchcock told truffaut that his lifelong fear of the police attracted him to the subject and was embedded in many scenes .
hitchcock's next film , " vertigo " ( *num* ) again starred james stewart , this time with kim novak and barbara bel geddes .
he had wanted vera miles to play the lead , but she was pregnant .
he told oriana fallaci : " i was offering her a big part , the chance to become a beautiful sophisticated blonde , a real actress .
we'd have spent a heap of dollars on it , and she has the bad taste to get pregnant .
i hate pregnant women , because then they have children .
" in the film , james stewart plays scottie , a former police investigator suffering from acrophobia , who develops an obsession with a woman he has been hired to shadow ( kim novak ) .
scottie's obsession leads to tragedy , and this time hitchcock does not opt for a happy ending .
some critics , including donald spoto and roger ebert , agree that " vertigo " is the director's most personal and revealing film , dealing with the " pygmalion"-like obsessions of a man who crafts a woman into the woman he desires .
" vertigo " explores more frankly and at greater length his interest in the relation between sex and death than any other work in his filmography .
"vertigo " contains a camera technique developed by irmin roberts , commonly referred to as a dolly zoom , that has been copied many times by filmmakers .
the film premiered at the san sebastián international film festival , where hitchcock won a silver seashell .
" vertigo " is considered a classic , but it attracted some negative reviews and poor box-office receipts at the time , and it was the last collaboration between stewart and hitchcock .
in the *num* " sight & sound " polls , it ranked just behind " citizen kane " ( *num* ) ; ten years later , in the same magazine , critics chose it as the best film ever made .
hitchcock followed " vertigo " with three more successful films , which are also recognised as among his best : " north by northwest " ( *num* ) , " psycho " ( *num* ) and " the birds " ( *num* ) .
in " north by northwest " , cary grant portrays roger thornhill , a madison avenue advertising executive who is mistaken for a government secret agent .
he is hotly pursued across the united states by enemy agents , including ( it appears ) eve kendall ( eva marie saint ) .
thornhill at first believes kendall is helping him , then that she is an enemy agent ; he eventually learns that she is working undercover for the cia .
during its opening two-week run at radio city music hall , the film grossed $404 , *num* ( ) , setting a record in that theatre's non-holiday gross .
" time " magazine called the film " smoothly troweled and thoroughly entertaining " .
"psycho " ( *num* ) is arguably hitchcock's best-known film .
based on robert bloch's novel " psycho " ( *num* ) , which was inspired by the case of ed gein , the film was produced on a constrained budget of $800 , *num* ( ) and shot in black-and-white on a spare set using crew members from " alfred hitchcock presents " .
the unprecedented violence of the shower scene , the early death of the heroine , and the innocent lives extinguished by a disturbed murderer became the hallmarks of a new horror-film genre .
the public loved the film , with lines stretching outside cinemas as people had to wait for the next showing .
it broke box-office records in the united kingdom , france , south america , the united states and canada and was a moderate success in australia for a brief period .
the film was the most profitable of hitchcock's career ; he personally earned well in excess of $15 million ( equivalent to $ million in ) .
he subsequently swapped his rights to " psycho " and his tv anthology for *num* , *num* shares of mca , making him the third largest shareholder and his own boss at universal , in theory at least , although that did not stop them from interfering with him .
following the first film , " psycho " became an american horror franchise : " psycho ii " , " psycho iii " , " bates motel " , " " , and a colour *num* remake of the original .
on *num* august *num* , hitchcock's *ord* birthday , the french director françois truffaut began a 50-hour interview of hitchcock , filmed over eight days at universal studios , during which hitchcock agreed to answer *num* questions .
it took four years to transcribe the tapes and organize the images ; it was published as a book in *num* ( the " hitchbook " , as truffaut called it ) , and the footage was released as a documentary in *num* .
truffaut sought the interview because it was clear to him that hitchcock was not simply the entertainer the american media made him out to be .
it was obvious from his films , truffaut wrote , that hitchcock had " given more thought to the potential of his art than any of his colleagues " .
he compared the interview to " oedipus ' consultation of the oracle " .
the film scholar peter william evans writes that " the birds " ( *num* ) and " marnie " ( *num* ) are regarded as " undisputed masterpieces " .
hitchcock had intended to film " marnie " first , and in march *num* it was announced that grace kelly , princess grace of monaco since *num* , would come out of retirement to star in it .
when kelly asked hitchcock to postpone " marnie " until *num* or *num* , he recruited evan hunter , author of " the blackboard jungle " ( *num* ) , to develop a screenplay based on a daphne du maurier short story , " the birds " ( *num* ) , which hitchcock had republished in his " my favorites in suspense " ( *num* ) .
he hired tippi hedren to play the lead role .
it was her first role ; she had been a model in new york when hitchcock saw her , in october *num* , in an nbc television ad for sego , a diet drink : " i signed her because she is a classic beauty .
movies don't have them any more .
grace kelly was the last .
" he insisted , without explanation , that her first name be written in single quotation marks : ' tippi ' .
in " the birds " , melanie daniels , a young socialite , meets lawyer mitch brenner ( rod taylor ) in a bird shop ; jessica tandy plays his possessive mother .
hedren visits him in bodega bay ( where " the birds " was filmed ) carrying a pair of lovebirds as a gift .
suddenly waves of birds start gathering , watching , and attacking .
the question : " what do the birds want ? " is left unanswered .
hitchcock made the film with equipment from the revue studio , which made " alfred hitchcock presents " .
he said it was his most technically challenging film yet , using a combination of trained and mechanical birds against a backdrop of wild ones .
every shot was sketched in advance .
an hbo / bbc television film , " the girl " ( *num* ) , depicted hedren's experiences on set ; she said that hitchcock became obsessed with her and sexually harassed her .
he reportedly isolated her from the rest of the crew , had her followed , whispered obscenities to her , had her handwriting analysed , and had a ramp built from his private office directly into her trailer .
diane baker , her co-star in " marnie " , said : " [ n ] othing could have been more horrible for me than to arrive on that movie set and to see her being treated the way she was .
" while filming the attack scene in the attic—which took a week to film—she was placed in a caged room while two men wearing elbow-length protective gloves threw live birds at her .
toward the end of the week , to stop the birds flying away from her too soon , one leg of each bird was attached by nylon thread to elastic bands sewn inside her clothes .
she broke down after a bird cut her lower eyelid , and filming was halted on doctor's orders .
in june *num* , grace kelly announced that she had decided against appearing in " marnie " ( *num* ) .
hedren had signed an exclusive seven-year , $500-a-week contract with him in october *num* , and he decided to cast her in the lead role opposite sean connery .
in *num* , describing hedren's performance as " one of the greatest in the history of cinema " , richard brody called the film a " story of sexual violence " inflicted on the character played by hedren : " the film is , to put it simply , sick , and it's so because hitchcock was sick .
he suffered all his life from furious sexual desire , suffered from the lack of its gratification , suffered from the inability to transform fantasy into reality , and then went ahead and did so virtually , by way of his art .
" a *num* " new york times " film review called it hitchcock's " most disappointing film in years " , citing hedren's and connery's lack of experience , an amateurish script and " glaringly fake cardboard backdrops " .
in the film , marnie edgar ( hedren ) steals $10 , *num* ( ) from her employer and goes on the run .
she applies for a job at mark rutland's ( connery ) company in philadelphia and steals from there too .
earlier she is shown having a panic attack during a thunderstorm and fearing the colour red .
mark tracks her down and blackmails her into marrying him .
she explains that she does not want to be touched , but during the " honeymoon " , mark rapes her .
marnie and mark discover that marnie's mother had been a prostitute when marnie was a child , and that , while the mother was fighting with a client during a thunderstorm—the mother believed the client had tried to molest marnie—marnie had killed the client to save her mother .
cured of her fears when she remembers what happened , she decides to stay with mark .
no longer speaking to her because she had rebuffed him , hitchcock apparently referred to hedren throughout as " the girl " rather than by name .
he told robert burks , the cinematographer , that the camera had to be placed as close as possible to hedren when he filmed her face .
evan hunter , the screenwriter of " the birds " who was writing " marnie " too , explained to hitchcock that , if mark loved marnie , he would comfort her , not rape her .
hitchcock reportedly replied : " evan , when he sticks it in her , i want that camera right on her face ! " when hunter submitted two versions of the script , one without the rape scene , hitchcock replaced him with jay presson allen .
failing health reduced hitchcock's output during the last two decades of his life .
biographer stephen rebello claimed universal " forced " two movies on him , " torn curtain " ( *num* ) and " topaz " ( *num* ) .
both were spy thrillers with cold war-related themes .
" torn curtain " , with paul newman and julie andrews , precipitated the bitter end of the 12-year collaboration between hitchcock and composer bernard herrmann .
hitchcock was unhappy with herrmann's score and replaced him with john addison , jay livingston and ray evans .
" topaz " ( *num* ) , based on a leon uris novel , is partly set in cuba .
both films received mixed reviews .
hitchcock returned to britain to make his penultimate film , " frenzy " ( *num* ) , based on the novel " goodbye piccadilly , farewell leicester square " ( *num* ) .
after two espionage films , the plot marked a return to the murder-thriller genre .
richard blaney ( jon finch ) , a volatile barman with a history of explosive anger , becomes the prime suspect in the investigation into the " necktie murders " , which are actually committed by his friend bob rusk ( barry foster ) .
this time , hitchcock makes the victim and villain kindreds , rather than opposites as in " strangers on a train " .
in " frenzy " , hitchcock allowed nudity for the first time .
two scenes show naked women , one of whom is being raped and strangled ; spoto called the latter " one of the most repellent examples of a detailed murder in the history of film " .
both actors , barbara leigh-hunt and anna massey , refused to do the scenes , so models were used instead .
biographers have noted that hitchcock had always pushed the limits of film censorship , often managing to fool joseph breen , the longtime head of hollywood's motion picture production code .
many times hitchcock slipped in subtle hints of improprieties forbidden by censorship until the mid-1960s .
yet mcgilligan wrote that breen and others often realised that hitchcock was inserting such things and were actually amused , as well as alarmed by hitchcock's " inescapable inferences " .
"family plot " ( *num* ) was hitchcock's last film .
it relates the escapades of " madam " blanche tyler , played by barbara harris , a fraudulent spiritualist , and her taxi-driver lover bruce dern , making a living from her phony powers .
while " family plot " was based on the victor canning novel " the rainbird pattern " ( *num* ) , the novel's tone is more sinister .
screenwriter ernest lehman originally wrote the film with a dark tone but was pushed to a lighter , more comical tone by hitchcock .
toward the end of his life , hitchcock was working on the script for a spy thriller , " the short night " , collaborating with james costigan , ernest lehman and david freeman .
despite preliminary work , it was never filmed .
hitchcock's health was declining and he was worried about his wife , who had suffered a stroke .
the screenplay was eventually published in freeman's book " the last days of alfred hitchcock " ( *num* ) .
having refused a cbe in *num* , hitchcock was appointed a knight commander of the most excellent order of the british empire ( kbe ) in the *num* new year honours .
he was too ill to travel to london—he had a pacemaker and was being given cortisone injections for his arthritis—so on *num* january *num* the british consul general presented him with the papers at universal studios .
asked by a reporter after the ceremony why it had taken the queen so long , hitchcock quipped , " i suppose it was a matter of carelessness .
" cary grant , janet leigh , and others attended a luncheon afterwards .
his last public appearance was on *num* march *num* , when he introduced the next year's winner of the american film institute award .
he died of kidney failure the following month , on *num* april , in his bel air home .
donald spoto , one of hitchcock's biographers , wrote that hitchcock had declined to see a priest , but according to jesuit priest mark henninger , he and another priest , tom sullivan , celebrated mass at the filmmaker's home , and sullivan heard his confession .
hitchcock was survived by his wife and daughter .
his funeral was held at good shepherd catholic church in beverly hills on *num* april , after which his body was cremated .
his remains were scattered over the pacific ocean on *num* may *num* .
hitchcock returned several times to cinematic devices such as the audience as voyeur , suspense , the wrong man or woman , and the " macguffin , " a plot device essential to the characters but irrelevant to the audience .
thus , the macguffin was always hazily described ( in " north by northwest " , leo g .
carroll describes james mason as an " importer-exporter " ) .
hitchcock appears briefly in most of his own films .
for example , he is seen struggling to get a double bass onto a train ( " strangers on a train " ) , walking dogs out of a pet shop ( " the birds " ) , fixing a neighbour's clock ( " rear window " ) , as a shadow ( " family plot " ) , sitting at a table in a photograph ( " dial m for murder " ) , and riding a bus ( " north by northwest " ) .
hitchcock's portrayal of women has been the subject of much scholarly debate .
bidisha wrote in " the guardian " in *num* : " there's the vamp , the tramp , the snitch , the witch , the slink , the double-crosser and , best of all , the demon mommy .
don't worry , they all get punished in the end .
" in a widely cited essay in *num* , laura mulvey introduced the idea of the male gaze ; the view of the spectator in hitchcock's films , she argued , is that of the heterosexual male protagonist .
" the female characters in his films reflected the same qualities over and over again " , roger ebert wrote in *num* .
" they were blonde .
they were icy and remote .
they were imprisoned in costumes that subtly combined fashion with fetishism .
they mesmerised the men , who often had physical or psychological handicaps .
sooner or later , every hitchcock woman was humiliated .
" the victims in " the lodger " are all blondes .
in " the *num* steps " ( *num* ) , madeleine carroll is put in handcuffs .
ingrid bergman , whom hitchcock directed three times ( " spellbound " ( *num* ) , " notorious " ( *num* ) , and " under capricorn " ( *num* ) ) , is dark blonde .
in " rear window " ( *num* ) , lisa ( grace kelly ) risks her life by breaking into lars thorwald's apartment .
in " to catch a thief " ( *num* ) , francie ( grace kelly again ) offers to help a man she believes is a burglar .
in " vertigo " ( *num* ) and " north by northwest " ( *num* ) respectively , kim novak and eva marie saint play the blonde heroines .
in " psycho " ( *num* ) , janet leigh's character steals $40 , *num* ( ) and is murdered by norman bates , a reclusive psychopath .
tippi hedren , a blonde , appears to be the focus of the attacks in " the birds " ( *num* ) .
in " marnie " ( *num* ) , the title character , again played by hedren , is a thief .
in " topaz " , french actresses dany robin as stafford's wife and claude jade as stafford's daughter are blonde heroines , the mistress was played by brunette karin dor .
hitchcock's last blonde heroine was barbara harris as a phony psychic turned amateur sleuth in " family plot " ( *num* ) , his final film .
in the same film , the diamond smuggler played by karen black wears a long blonde wig in several scenes .
his films often feature characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers , such as norman bates in " psycho " .
in " north by northwest " ( *num* ) , roger thornhill ( cary grant ) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy , murderous men are after him .
in " the birds " ( *num* ) , the rod taylor character , an innocent man , finds his world under attack by vicious birds , and struggles to free himself from a clinging mother ( jessica tandy ) .
the killer in " frenzy " ( *num* ) has a loathing of women but idolises his mother .
the villain bruno in " strangers on a train " hates his father , but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother ( played by marion lorne ) .
sebastian ( claude rains ) in " notorious " has a clearly conflicting relationship with his mother , who is ( rightly ) suspicious of his new bride , alicia huberman ( ingrid bergman ) .
hitchcock became known for having remarked that " actors are cattle .
" during the filming of " mr .
& mrs .
smith " ( *num* ) , carole lombard brought three cows onto the set wearing the name tags of lombard , robert montgomery , and gene raymond , the stars of the film , to surprise him .
hitchcock believed that actors should concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters .
he told bryan forbes in *num* : " i remember discussing with a method actor how he was taught and so forth .
he said , ' we're taught using improvisation .
we are given an idea and then we are turned loose to develop in any way we want to .
' i said ' that's not acting .
that's writing .
' " walter slezak said that hitchcock knew the mechanics of acting better than anyone he knew .
critics observed that , despite his reputation as a man who disliked actors , actors who worked with him often gave brilliant performances .
he used the same actors in many of his films ; cary grant worked with hitchcock four times , and ingrid bergman three .
james mason said that hitchcock regarded actors as " animated props " .
for hitchcock , the actors were part of the film's setting .
he told françois truffaut : " the chief requisite for an actor is the ability to do nothing well , which is by no means as easy as it sounds .
he should be willing to be utilised and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera .
he must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights .
" hitchcock planned his scripts in detail with his writers .
in " writing with hitchcock " ( *num* ) , steven derosa noted that hitchcock supervised them through every draft , asking that they tell the story visually .
he told roger ebert in *num* : hitchcock's films were extensively storyboarded to the finest detail .
he was reported to have never even bothered looking through the viewfinder , since he did not need to , although in publicity photos he was shown doing so .
he also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision .
if a studio asked him to change a film , he would claim that it was already shot in a single way , and that there were no alternative takes to consider .
this view of hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by bill krohn , the american correspondent of french film magazine " cahiers du cinéma " , in his book " hitchcock at work " .
after investigating script revisions , notes to other production personnel written by or to hitchcock , and other production material , krohn observed that hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned .
he noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to hitchcock , often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his films , was to a great degree perpetuated by hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios .
for example , the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of " north by northwest " was not storyboarded at all .
after the scene was filmed , the publicity department asked hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film , and hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail .
even when storyboards were made , scenes that were shot differed from them significantly .
krohn's analysis of the production of hitchcock classics like " notorious " reveals that hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production .
another example krohn notes is the american remake of " the man who knew too much , " whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule , something that , as krohn notes , was not an uncommon occurrence on many of hitchcock's films , including " strangers on a train " and " topaz " .
while hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his films , he was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines utilised during many other film productions .
krohn's work also sheds light on hitchcock's practice of generally shooting in chronological order , which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and , more importantly , differed from the standard operating procedure of hollywood in the studio system era .
equally important is hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternative takes of scenes .
this differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how he / she chooses ( often under the producer's aegis ) .
rather they represented hitchcock's tendency to give himself options in the editing room , where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work .
according to krohn , this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of hitchcock's personal papers , script revisions and the like refute the notion of hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films , whose vision of his films did not change during production , which krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of alfred hitchcock .
both his fastidiousness and attention to detail also found their way into each film poster for his films .
hitchcock preferred to work with the best talent of his day—film poster designers such as bill gold and saul bass—who would produce posters that accurately represented his films .
hitchcock was inducted into the hollywood walk of fame on *num* february *num* with two stars : one for television and a second for his motion pictures .
in *num* john russell taylor described him as " the most universally recognizable person in the world " and " a straightforward middle-class englishman who just happened to be an artistic genius " .
in *num* " moviemaker " named him the most influential director of all time , and a *num* " the daily telegraph " critics ' poll ranked him britain's greatest director .
david gritten , the newspaper's film critic , wrote : " unquestionably the greatest filmmaker to emerge from these islands , hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema , which would be utterly different without him .
" he won two golden globes , eight laurel awards , and five lifetime achievement awards , including the first bafta academy fellowship award and , in *num* , an afi life achievement award .
he was nominated five times for an academy award for best director .
" rebecca " , nominated for *num* oscars , won the academy award for best picture of *num* ; another hitchcock film , " foreign correspondent " , was also nominated that year .
by *num* eight of his films had been selected for preservation by the united states national film registry : " rebecca " ( *num* ) , " shadow of a doubt " ( *num* ) , " notorious " ( *num* ) , " rear window " ( *num* ) , " vertigo " ( *num* ) , " north by northwest " ( *num* ) , " psycho " ( *num* ) , and " the birds " ( *num* ) .
in *num* hitchcock was selected by artist sir peter blake , author of the beatles ' " sgt .
pepper's lonely hearts club band " album cover , to appear in a new version of the cover , along with other british cultural figures , and he was featured that year in a bbc radio *num* series , " the new elizabethans " , as someone " whose actions during the reign of elizabeth ii have had a significant impact on lives in these islands and given the age its character " .
in june *num* nine restored versions of hitchcock's early silent films , including " the pleasure garden " ( *num* ) , were shown at the brooklyn academy of music's harvey theatre ; known as " the hitchcock *num* " , the travelling tribute was organised by the british film institute .
the alfred hitchcock collection is housed at the academy film archive in hollywood , california .
it includes home movies , *num* mm film shot on the set of " blackmail " ( *num* ) and " frenzy " ( *num* ) , and the earliest known colour footage of hitchcock .
the academy film archive preserves many of his home movies .
the alfred hitchcock papers is housed at the academy's margaret herrick library .
the david o .
selznick and the ernest lehman collections housed at the harry ransom humanities research center in austin , texas , contain material related to hitchcock's work on the production of " the paradine case " , " rebecca " , " spellbound " , " north by northwest " and " family plot .
" silent films sound films seven films six films five films four films three films two films many of the british actors additionally appeared in some of the two dozen or so films hitchcock worked on in other capacities , such as co-writer , title designer , art director and assistant director .
bayesian probability bayesian probability is an interpretation of the concept of probability , in which , instead of frequency or propensity of some phenomenon , probability is interpreted as reasonable expectation representing a state of knowledge or as quantification of a personal belief .
the bayesian interpretation of probability can be seen as an extension of propositional logic that enables reasoning with hypotheses , i .
e .
, the propositions whose truth or falsity is uncertain .
in the bayesian view , a probability is assigned to a hypothesis , whereas under frequentist inference , a hypothesis is typically tested without being assigned a probability .
bayesian probability belongs to the category of evidential probabilities ; to evaluate the probability of a hypothesis , the bayesian probabilist specifies some prior probability , which is then updated to a posterior probability in the light of new , relevant data ( evidence ) .
the bayesian interpretation provides a standard set of procedures and formulae to perform this calculation .
the term " bayesian " derives from the *ord* century mathematician and theologian thomas bayes , who provided the first mathematical treatment of a non-trivial problem of statistical data analysis using what is now known as bayesian inference .
mathematician pierre-simon laplace pioneered and popularised what is now called bayesian probability .
bayesian methods are characterized by concepts and procedures as follows : broadly speaking , there are two interpretations on bayesian probability .
for " objectivists " , interpreting probability as extension of logic , " probability " quantifies the reasonable expectation everyone ( even a " robot " ) sharing the same knowledge should share in accordance with the rules of bayesian statistics , which can be justified by cox's theorem .
for " subjectivists " , " probability " corresponds to a personal belief .
rationality and coherence allow for substantial variation within the constraints they pose ; the constraints are justified by the dutch book argument or by the decision theory and de finetti's theorem .
the objective and subjective variants of bayesian probability differ mainly in their interpretation and construction of the prior probability .
the term " bayesian " refers to thomas bayes ( 1702–1761 ) , who proved a special case of what is now called bayes ' theorem in a paper titled " an essay towards solving a problem in the doctrine of chances " .
in that special case , the prior and posterior distributions were beta distributions and the data came from bernoulli trials .
it was pierre-simon laplace ( 1749–1827 ) who introduced a general version of the theorem and used it to approach problems in celestial mechanics , medical statistics , reliability , and jurisprudence .
early bayesian inference , which used uniform priors following laplace's principle of insufficient reason , was called " inverse probability " ( because it infers backwards from observations to parameters , or from effects to causes ) .
after the 1920s , " inverse probability " was largely supplanted by a collection of methods that came to be called frequentist statistics .
in the *ord* century , the ideas of laplace developed in two directions , giving rise to " objective " and " subjective " currents in bayesian practice .
harold jeffreys ' " theory of probability " ( first published in *num* ) played an important role in the revival of the bayesian view of probability , followed by works by abraham wald ( *num* ) and leonard j .
savage ( *num* ) .
the adjective " bayesian " itself dates to the 1950s ; the derived " bayesianism " , " neo-bayesianism " is of 1960s coinage .
in the objectivist stream , the statistical analysis depends on only the model assumed and the data analysed .
no subjective decisions need to be involved .
in contrast , " subjectivist " statisticians deny the possibility of fully objective analysis for the general case .
in the 1980s , there was a dramatic growth in research and applications of bayesian methods , mostly attributed to the discovery of markov chain monte carlo methods and the consequent removal of many of the computational problems , and to an increasing interest in nonstandard , complex applications .
while frequentist statistics remains strong ( as seen by the fact that most undergraduate teaching is still based on it ) , bayesian methods are widely accepted and used , e .
g .
, in the field of machine learning .
the use of bayesian probabilities as the basis of bayesian inference has been supported by several arguments , such as cox axioms , the dutch book argument , arguments based on decision theory and de finetti's theorem .
richard t .
cox showed that bayesian updating follows from several axioms , including two functional equations and a hypothesis of differentiability .
the assumption of differentiability or even continuity is controversial ; halpern found a counterexample based on his observation that the boolean algebra of statements may be finite .
other axiomatizations have been suggested by various authors with the purpose of making the theory more rigorous .
the dutch book argument was proposed by de finetti ; it is based on betting .
a dutch book is made when a clever gambler places a set of bets that guarantee a profit , no matter what the outcome of the bets .
if a bookmaker follows the rules of the bayesian calculus in the construction of his odds , a dutch book cannot be made .
however , ian hacking noted that traditional dutch book arguments did not specify bayesian updating : they left open the possibility that non-bayesian updating rules could avoid dutch books .
for example , hacking writes " and neither the dutch book argument , nor any other in the personalist arsenal of proofs of the probability axioms , entails the dynamic assumption .
not one entails bayesianism .
so the personalist requires the dynamic assumption to be bayesian .
it is true that in consistency a personalist could abandon the bayesian model of learning from experience .
salt could lose its savour .
" in fact , there are non-bayesian updating rules that also avoid dutch books ( as discussed in the literature on " probability kinematics " following the publication of richard c .
jeffreys ' rule , which is itself regarded as bayesian ) .
the additional hypotheses sufficient to ( uniquely ) specify bayesian updating are substantial and not universally seen as satisfactory .
a decision-theoretic justification of the use of bayesian inference ( and hence of bayesian probabilities ) was given by abraham wald , who proved that every admissible statistical procedure is either a bayesian procedure or a limit of bayesian procedures .
conversely , every bayesian procedure is admissible .
following the work on expected utility theory of ramsey and von neumann , decision-theorists have accounted for rational behavior using a probability distribution for the agent .
johann pfanzagl completed the " theory of games and economic behavior " by providing an axiomatization of subjective probability and utility , a task left uncompleted by von neumann and oskar morgenstern : their original theory supposed that all the agents had the same probability distribution , as a convenience .
pfanzagl's axiomatization was endorsed by oskar morgenstern : " von neumann and i have anticipated .
.
.
[ the question whether probabilities ] might , perhaps more typically , be subjective and have stated specifically that in the latter case axioms could be found from which could derive the desired numerical utility together with a number for the probabilities ( cf .
p .
*num* of the theory of games and economic behavior ) .
we did not carry this out ; it was demonstrated by pfanzagl .
.
.
with all the necessary rigor " .
ramsey and savage noted that the individual agent's probability distribution could be objectively studied in experiments .
procedures for testing hypotheses about probabilities ( using finite samples ) are due to ramsey ( *num* ) and de finetti ( *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* ) .
both bruno de finetti and frank p .
ramsey acknowledge their debts to pragmatic philosophy , particularly ( for ramsey ) to charles s .
peirce .
the " ramsey test " for evaluating probability distributions is implementable in theory , and has kept experimental psychologists occupied for a half century .
this work demonstrates that bayesian-probability propositions can be falsified , and so meet an empirical criterion of charles s .
peirce , whose work inspired ramsey .
( this falsifiability-criterion was popularized by karl popper .
) modern work on the experimental evaluation of personal probabilities uses the randomization , blinding , and boolean-decision procedures of the peirce-jastrow experiment .
since individuals act according to different probability judgments , these agents ' probabilities are " personal " ( but amenable to objective study ) .
personal probabilities are problematic for science and for some applications where decision-makers lack the knowledge or time to specify an informed probability-distribution ( on which they are prepared to act ) .
to meet the needs of science and of human limitations , bayesian statisticians have developed " objective " methods for specifying prior probabilities .
indeed , some bayesians have argued the prior state of knowledge defines " the " ( unique ) prior probability-distribution for " regular " statistical problems ; cf .
well-posed problems .
finding the right method for constructing such " objective " priors ( for appropriate classes of regular problems ) has been the quest of statistical theorists from laplace to john maynard keynes , harold jeffreys , and edwin thompson jaynes .
these theorists and their successors have suggested several methods for constructing " objective " priors ( unfortunately , it is not clear how to assess the relative " objectivity " of the priors proposed under these methods ) : each of these methods contributes useful priors for " regular " one-parameter problems , and each prior can handle some challenging statistical models ( with " irregularity " or several parameters ) .
each of these methods has been useful in bayesian practice .
indeed , methods for constructing " objective " ( alternatively , " default " or " ignorance " ) priors have been developed by avowed subjective ( or " personal " ) bayesians like james berger ( duke university ) and josé-miguel bernardo ( universitat de valència ) , simply because such priors are needed for bayesian practice , particularly in science .
the quest for " the universal method for constructing priors " continues to attract statistical theorists .
thus , the bayesian statistician needs either to use informed priors ( using relevant expertise or previous data ) or to choose among the competing methods for constructing " objective " priors .
cement a cement is a binder , a substance used for construction that sets , hardens , and adheres to other materials to bind them together .
cement is seldom used on its own , but rather to bind sand and gravel ( aggregate ) together .
cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry , or with sand and gravel , produces concrete .
cement is the most widely used material in existence and is only behind water as the planet's most-consumed resource .
cements used in construction are usually inorganic , often lime or calcium silicate based , and can be characterized as either hydraulic or non-hydraulic , depending on the ability of the cement to set in the presence of water ( see hydraulic and non-hydraulic lime plaster ) .
non-hydraulic cement does not set in wet conditions or under water .
rather , it sets as it dries and reacts with carbon dioxide in the air .
it is resistant to attack by chemicals after setting .
hydraulic cements ( e .
g .
, portland cement ) set and become adhesive due to a chemical reaction between the dry ingredients and water .
the chemical reaction results in mineral hydrates that are not very water-soluble and so are quite durable in water and safe from chemical attack .
this allows setting in wet conditions or under water and further protects the hardened material from chemical attack .
the chemical process for hydraulic cement found by ancient romans used volcanic ash ( pozzolana ) with added lime ( calcium oxide ) .
the word " cement " can be traced back to the roman term " opus caementicium " , used to describe masonry resembling modern concrete that was made from crushed rock with burnt lime as binder .
the volcanic ash and pulverized brick supplements that were added to the burnt lime , to obtain a hydraulic binder , were later referred to as " cementum " , " cimentum " , " cäment " , and " cement " .
in modern times , organic polymers are sometimes used as cements in concrete .
non-hydraulic cement , such as slaked lime ( calcium oxide mixed with water ) , hardens by carbonation in the presence of carbon dioxide , which is naturally present in the air .
first calcium oxide ( lime ) is produced from calcium carbonate ( limestone or chalk ) by calcination at temperatures above *num* °c ( *num* , *num* °f ) for about *num* hours at atmospheric pressure : the calcium oxide is then " spent " ( slaked ) mixing it with water to make slaked lime ( calcium hydroxide ) : once the excess water is completely evaporated ( this process is technically called " setting " ) , the carbonation starts : this reaction takes time , because the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the air is low .
the carbonation reaction requires that the dry cement be exposed to air , so the slaked lime is a non-hydraulic cement and cannot be used under water .
this process is called the " lime cycle " .
conversely , hydraulic cement hardens by hydration when water is added .
hydraulic cements ( such as portland cement ) are made of a mixture of silicates and oxides , the four main components being : the silicates are responsible for the cement's mechanical properties—the tricalcium aluminate and brownmillerite are essential for formation of the liquid phase during the kiln sintering ( firing ) .
the chemistry of these reactions is not completely clear and is still the object of research .
perhaps the earliest known occurrence of cement is from twelve million years ago .
a deposit of cement was formed after an occurrence of oil shale located adjacent to a bed of limestone burned due to natural causes .
these ancient deposits were investigated in the 1960s and 1970s .
cement , chemically speaking , is a product that includes lime as the primary curing ingredient , but is far from the first material used for cement"ation " .
the babylonians and assyrians used bitumen to bind together burnt brick or alabaster slabs .
in egypt stone blocks were cemented together with a mortar made of sand and roughly burnt gypsum ( caso·2ho ) , which often contained calcium carbonate ( caco ) .
lime ( calcium oxide ) was used on crete and by the ancient greeks .
there is evidence that the minoans of crete used crushed potshards as an artificial pozzolan for hydraulic cement .
nobody knows who first discovered that a combination of hydrated non-hydraulic lime and a pozzolan produces a hydraulic mixture ( see also : pozzolanic reaction ) —but such concrete was used by the ancient macedonians , and three centuries later on a large scale by roman engineers .
the greeks used volcanic tuff from the island of thera as their pozzolan and the romans used crushed volcanic ash ( activated aluminium silicates ) with lime .
this mixture could set under water , increasing its resistance .
the material was called " pozzolana " from the town of pozzuoli , west of naples where volcanic ash was extracted .
in the absence of pozzolanic ash , the romans used powdered brick or pottery as a substitute and they may have used crushed tiles for this purpose before discovering natural sources near rome .
the huge dome of the pantheon in rome and the massive baths of caracalla are examples of ancient structures made from these concretes , many of which still stand .
the vast system of roman aqueducts also made extensive use of hydraulic cement .
roman concrete was rarely used on the outside of buildings .
the normal technique was to use brick facing material as the formwork for an infill of mortar mixed with an aggregate of broken pieces of stone , brick , potsherds , recycled chunks of concrete , or other building rubble .
any preservation of this knowledge in literature from the middle ages is unknown , but medieval masons and some military engineers actively used hydraulic cement in structures such as canals , fortresses , harbors , and shipbuilding facilities .
a mixture of lime mortar and aggregate with brick or stone facing material was used in the eastern roman empire as well as in the west into the gothic period .
the german rhineland continued to use hydraulic mortar throughout the middle ages , having local pozzolana deposits called trass .
tabby is a building material made from oyster-shell lime , sand , and whole oyster shells to form a concrete .
the spanish introduced it to the americas in the sixteenth century .
the technical knowledge for making hydraulic cement was formalized by french and british engineers in the *ord* century .
john smeaton made an important contribution to the development of cements while planning the construction of the third eddystone lighthouse ( 1755–59 ) in the english channel now known as smeaton's tower .
he needed a hydraulic mortar that would set and develop some strength in the twelve-hour period between successive high tides .
he performed experiments with combinations of different limestones and additives including trass and pozzolanas and did exhaustive market research on the available hydraulic limes , visiting their production sites , and noted that the " hydraulicity " of the lime was directly related to the clay content of the limestone used to make it .
smeaton was a civil engineer by profession , and took the idea no further .
in the south atlantic seaboard of the united states , tabby relying on the oyster-shell middens of earlier native american populations was used in house construction from the 1730s to the 1860s .
in britain particularly , good quality building stone became ever more expensive during a period of rapid growth , and it became a common practice to construct prestige buildings from the new industrial bricks , and to finish them with a stucco to imitate stone .
hydraulic limes were favored for this , but the need for a fast set time encouraged the development of new cements .
most famous was parker's " roman cement " .
this was developed by james parker in the 1780s , and finally patented in *num* .
it was , in fact , nothing like material used by the romans , but was a " natural cement " made by burning septaria – nodules that are found in certain clay deposits , and that contain both clay minerals and calcium carbonate .
the burnt nodules were ground to a fine powder .
this product , made into a mortar with sand , set in 5–15 minutes .
the success of " roman cement " led other manufacturers to develop rival products by burning artificial hydraulic lime cements of clay and chalk .
roman cement quickly became popular but was largely replaced by portland cement in the 1850s .
apparently unaware of smeaton's work , the same principle was identified by frenchman louis vicat in the first decade of the nineteenth century .
vicat went on to devise a method of combining chalk and clay into an intimate mixture , and , burning this , produced an " artificial cement " in *num* considered the " principal forerunner " of portland cement and " .
.
.
edgar dobbs of southwark patented a cement of this kind in *num* .
" in russia , egor cheliev created a new binder by mixing lime and clay .
his results were published in *num* in his book " a treatise on the art to prepare a good mortar " published in st .
petersburg .
a few years later in *num* , he published another book , which described various methods of making cement and concrete , and the benefits of cement in the construction of buildings and embankments .
portland cement , the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete , mortar , stucco , and non-speciality grout , was developed in england in the mid *ord* century , and usually originates from limestone .
james frost produced what he called " british cement " in a similar manner around the same time , but did not obtain a patent until *num* .
in *num* , joseph aspdin patented a similar material , which he called " portland cement " , because the render made from it was in color similar to the prestigious portland stone quarried on the isle of portland , dorset , england .
however , aspdins ' cement was nothing like modern portland cement but was a first step in its development , called a " proto-portland cement " .
joseph aspdins ' son william aspdin had left his father's company and in his cement manufacturing apparently accidentally produced calcium silicates in the 1840s , a middle step in the development of portland cement .
william aspdin's innovation was counterintuitive for manufacturers of " artificial cements " , because they required more lime in the mix ( a problem for his father ) , a much higher kiln temperature ( and therefore more fuel ) , and the resulting clinker was very hard and rapidly wore down the millstones , which were the only available grinding technology of the time .
manufacturing costs were therefore considerably higher , but the product set reasonably slowly and developed strength quickly , thus opening up a market for use in concrete .
the use of concrete in construction grew rapidly from *num* onward , and was soon the dominant use for cements .
thus portland cement began its predominant role .
isaac charles johnson further refined the production of " meso-portland cement " ( middle stage of development ) and claimed he was the real father of portland cement .
setting time and " early strength " are important characteristics of cements .
hydraulic limes , " natural " cements , and " artificial " cements all rely on their belite content for strength development .
belite develops strength slowly .
because they were burned at temperatures below , they contained no alite , which is responsible for early strength in modern cements .
the first cement to consistently contain alite was made by william aspdin in the early 1840s : this was what we call today " modern " portland cement .
because of the air of mystery with which william aspdin surrounded his product , others ( " e .
g .
, " vicat and johnson ) have claimed precedence in this invention , but recent analysis of both his concrete and raw cement have shown that william aspdin's product made at northfleet , kent was a true alite-based cement .
however , aspdin's methods were " rule-of-thumb " : vicat is responsible for establishing the chemical basis of these cements , and johnson established the importance of sintering the mix in the kiln .
in the us the first large-scale use of cement was rosendale cement , a natural cement mined from a massive deposit of a large dolostone rock deposit discovered in the early *ord* century near rosendale , new york .
rosendale cement was extremely popular for the foundation of buildings ( " e .
g .
" , statue of liberty , capitol building , brooklyn bridge ) and lining water pipes .
sorel cement was patented in *num* by frenchman stanislas sorel .
it was stronger than portland cement but its poor water resistance and corrosive qualities limited its use in building construction .
the next development in the manufacture of portland cement was the introduction of the rotary kiln , which produced a stronger , more homogeneous mixture and facilitated a continuous manufacturing process .
calcium aluminate cements were patented in *num* in france by jules bied for better resistance to sulfates .
in the us , after world war one , the long curing time of at least a month for rosendale cement made it unpopular for constructing highways and bridges , and many states and construction firms turned to portland cement .
because of the switch to portland cement , by the end of the 1920s only one of the *num* rosendale cement companies had survived .
but in the early 1930s , builders discovered that , while portland cement set faster , it was not as durable , especially for highways—to the point that some states stopped building highways and roads with cement .
bertrain h .
wait , an engineer whose company had helped construct the new york city's catskill aqueduct , was impressed with the durability of rosendale cement , and came up with a blend of both rosendale and synthetic cements that had the good attributes of both .
it was highly durable and had a much faster setting time .
wait convinced the new york commissioner of highways to construct an experimental section of highway near new paltz , new york , using one sack of rosendale to six sacks of synthetic cement .
it was a success , and for decades the rosendale-synthetic cement blend was used in highway and bridge construction .
modern hydraulic development began with the start of the industrial revolution ( around *num* ) , driven by three main needs : modern cements are often portland cement or portland cement blends , but industry also uses other cements .
portland cement is by far the most common type of cement in general use around the world .
this cement is made by heating limestone ( calcium carbonate ) with other materials ( such as clay ) to *num* °c in a kiln , in a process known as calcination that liberates a molecule of carbon dioxide from the calcium carbonate to form calcium oxide , or quicklime—which then chemically combines with the other materials in the mix to form calcium silicates and other cementitious compounds .
the resulting hard substance , called ' clinker ' , is then ground with a small amount of gypsum into a powder to make " ordinary portland cement " , the most commonly used type of cement ( often referred to as opc ) .
portland cement is a basic ingredient of concrete , mortar , and most non-specialty grout .
the most common use for portland cement is to make concrete .
concrete is a composite material made of aggregate ( gravel and sand ) , cement , and water .
as a construction material , concrete can be cast in almost any shape , and once it hardens , can be a structural ( load bearing ) element .
portland cement may be grey or white .
portland cement blends are often available as inter-ground mixtures from cement producers , but similar formulations are often also mixed from the ground components at the concrete mixing plant .
portland blast-furnace slag cement , or blast furnace cement ( astm c595 and en 197-1 nomenclature respectively ) , contains up to *num* % ground granulated blast furnace slag , with the rest portland clinker and a little gypsum .
all compositions produce high ultimate strength , but as slag content is increased , early strength is reduced , while sulfate resistance increases and heat evolution diminishes .
used as an economic alternative to portland sulfate-resisting and low-heat cements .
portland-fly ash cement contains up to *num* % fly ash under astm standards ( astm c595 ) , or *num* % under en standards ( en 197-1 ) .
the fly ash is pozzolanic , so that ultimate strength is maintained .
because fly ash addition allows a lower concrete water content , early strength can also be maintained .
where good quality cheap fly ash is available , this can be an economic alternative to ordinary portland cement .
portland pozzolan cement includes fly ash cement , since fly ash is a pozzolan , but also includes cements made from other natural or artificial pozzolans .
in countries where volcanic ashes are available ( e .
g .
, italy , chile , mexico , the philippines ) , these cements are often the most common form in use .
the maximum replacement ratios are generally defined as for portland-fly ash cement .
portland silica fume cement .
addition of silica fume can yield exceptionally high strengths , and cements containing 5–20 % silica fume are occasionally produced , with *num* % being the maximum allowed addition under en 197-1 .
however , silica fume is more usually added to portland cement at the concrete mixer .
masonry cements are used for preparing bricklaying mortars and stuccos , and must not be used in concrete .
they are usually complex proprietary formulations containing portland clinker and a number of other ingredients that may include limestone , hydrated lime , air entrainers , retarders , waterproofers and coloring agents .
they are formulated to yield workable mortars that allow rapid and consistent masonry work .
subtle variations of masonry cement in the us are plastic cements and stucco cements .
these are designed to produce a controlled bond with masonry blocks .
expansive cements contain , in addition to portland clinker , expansive clinkers ( usually sulfoaluminate clinkers ) , and are designed to offset the effects of drying shrinkage normally encountered in hydraulic cements .
this cement can make concrete for floor slabs ( up to *num* m square ) without contraction joints .
white blended cements may be made using white clinker ( containing little or no iron ) and white supplementary materials such as high-purity metakaolin .
colored cements serve decorative purposes .
some standards allow the addition of pigments to produce " colored portland cement " .
other standards ( e .
g .
, astm ) don't allow pigments in portland cement , and colored cements are sold as " blended hydraulic cements " .
very finely ground cements are cement mixed with sand or with slag or other pozzolan type minerals that are extremely finely ground together .
such cements can have the same physical characteristics as normal cement but with *num* % less cement , particularly due to their increased surface area for the chemical reaction .
even with intensive grinding they can use up to *num* % less energy ( and thus less carbon emissions ) to fabricate than ordinary portland cements .
"pozzolan-lime cements " are mixtures of ground pozzolan and lime .
these are the cements the romans used , and are present in surviving roman structures like the pantheon in rome .
they develop strength slowly , but their ultimate strength can be very high .
the hydration products that produce strength are essentially the same as those in portland cement .
"slag-lime cements"—ground granulated blast-furnace slag is not hydraulic on its own , but is " activated " by addition of alkalis , most economically using lime .
they are similar to pozzolan lime cements in their properties .
only granulated slag ( i .
e .
, water-quenched , glassy slag ) is effective as a cement component .
"supersulfated cements " contain about *num* % ground granulated blast furnace slag , *num* % gypsum or anhydrite and a little portland clinker or lime as an activator .
they produce strength by formation of ettringite , with strength growth similar to a slow portland cement .
they exhibit good resistance to aggressive agents , including sulfate .
calcium aluminate cements are hydraulic cements made primarily from limestone and bauxite .
the active ingredients are monocalcium aluminate caalo ( cao · alo or ca in cement chemist notation , ccn ) and mayenite caalo ( *num* cao · *num* alo , or ca in ccn ) .
strength forms by hydration to calcium aluminate hydrates .
they are well-adapted for use in refractory ( high-temperature resistant ) concretes , e .
g .
, for furnace linings .
"calcium sulfoaluminate cements " are made from clinkers that include ye'elimite ( ca ( alo ) so or ca in cement chemist's notation ) as a primary phase .
they are used in expansive cements , in ultra-high early strength cements , and in " low-energy " cements .
hydration produces ettringite , and specialized physical properties ( such as expansion or rapid reaction ) are obtained by adjustment of the availability of calcium and sulfate ions .
their use as a low-energy alternative to portland cement has been pioneered in china , where several million tonnes per year are produced .
energy requirements are lower because of the lower kiln temperatures required for reaction , and the lower amount of limestone ( which must be endothermically decarbonated ) in the mix .
in addition , the lower limestone content and lower fuel consumption leads to a co emission around half that associated with portland clinker .
however , so emissions are usually significantly higher .
""natural " cements " corresponding to certain cements of the pre-portland era , are produced by burning argillaceous limestones at moderate temperatures .
the level of clay components in the limestone ( around 30–35 % ) is such that large amounts of belite ( the low-early strength , high-late strength mineral in portland cement ) are formed without the formation of excessive amounts of free lime .
as with any natural material , such cements have highly variable properties .
"geopolymer cements " are made from mixtures of water-soluble alkali metal silicates , and aluminosilicate mineral powders such as fly ash and metakaolin .
polymer cements are made from organic chemicals that polymerise .
producers often use thermoset materials .
while they are often significantly more expensive , they can give a water proof material that has useful tensile strength .
cement starts to set when mixed with water , which causes a series of hydration chemical reactions .
the constituents slowly hydrate and the mineral hydrates solidify .
the interlocking of the hydrates gives cement its strength .
contrary to popular belief , hydraulic cement does not set by drying out—proper curing requires maintaining the appropriate moisture content during the curing process .
if hydraulic cements dry out during curing , the resulting product can be significantly weakened .
a minimum temperature of *num* °c is recommended .
bags of cement routinely have health and safety warnings printed on them because not only is cement highly alkaline , but the setting process is exothermic .
as a result , wet cement is strongly caustic ( ph = *num* .
*num* ) and can easily cause severe skin burns if not promptly washed off with water .
similarly , dry cement powder in contact with mucous membranes can cause severe eye or respiratory irritation .
some trace elements , such as chromium , from impurities naturally present in the raw materials used to produce cement may cause allergic dermatitis .
reducing agents such as ferrous sulfate ( feso ) are often added to cement to convert the carcinogenic hexavalent chromate ( cro ) into trivalent chromium ( cr ) , a less toxic chemical species .
cement users need also to wear appropriate gloves and protective clothing .
in *num* , the world production of hydraulic cement was .
the top three producers were china with *num* , *num* , india with *num* , and usa with *num* .
*num* million tonnes for a total of over half the world total by the world's three most populated states .
for the world capacity to produce cement in *num* , the situation was similar with the top three states ( china , india , and usa ) accounting for just under half the world total capacity .
over *num* and *num* , global consumption continued to climb , rising to *num* mt in *num* and *num* mt in *num* , while annual growth rates eased to *num* .
*num* % and *num* .
*num* % , respectively .
china , representing an increasing share of world cement consumption , remains the main engine of global growth .
by *num* , chinese demand was recorded at *num* mt , representing *num* % of world consumption .
annual growth rates , which reached *num* % in *num* , appear to have softened , slowing to 5–6 % over *num* and *num* , as china's economy targets a more sustainable growth rate .
outside of china , worldwide consumption climbed by *num* .
*num* % to *num* mt in *num* , *num* % to *num* mt in *num* , and finally *num* .
*num* % to *num* mt in *num* .
iran is now the *ord* largest cement producer in the world and has increased its output by over *num* % from *num* to *num* .
due to climbing energy costs in pakistan and other major cement-producing countries , iran is in a unique position as a trading partner , utilizing its own surplus petroleum to power clinker plants .
now a top producer in the middle-east , iran is further increasing its dominant position in local markets and abroad .
the performance in north america and europe over the 2010–12 period contrasted strikingly with that of china , as the global financial crisis evolved into a sovereign debt crisis for many economies in this region and recession .
cement consumption levels for this region fell by *num* .
*num* % in *num* to *num* mt , recovered by *num* .
*num* % in *num* , then dipped again by *num* .
*num* % in *num* .
the performance in the rest of the world , which includes many emerging economies in asia , africa and latin america and representing some *num* mt cement demand in *num* , was positive and more than offset the declines in north america and europe .
annual consumption growth was recorded at *num* .
*num* % in *num* , moderating to *num* .
*num* % and *num* .
*num* % in *num* and *num* , respectively .
as at year-end *num* , the global cement industry consisted of *num* cement production facilities , including both integrated and grinding , of which *num* were located in china and *num* in the rest of the world .
total cement capacity worldwide was recorded at *num* mt in *num* , with *num* mt located in china and *num* mt in the rest of the world .
"for the past *num* years , china consistently has produced more cement than any other country in the world .
[ .
.
.
] ( however , ) china's cement export peaked in *num* with *num* million tonnes shipped out and has been in steady decline ever since .
only *num* .
*num* million tonnes were exported out of china in *num* .
offered at $34 a ton , chinese cement is pricing itself out of the market as thailand is asking as little as $20 for the same quality .
" in *num* , it was estimated that china manufactured *num* .
*num* billion tonnes of cement , which was *num* % of the world total cement production .
" demand for cement in china is expected to advance *num* .
*num* % annually and exceed *num* billion tonnes in *num* , driven by slowing but healthy growth in construction expenditures .
cement consumed in china will amount to *num* % of global demand , and china will remain the world's largest national consumer of cement by a large margin .
" in *num* , *num* .
*num* billion tonnes of cement was consumed globally .
of this , china accounted for *num* .
*num* billion tonnes .
cement manufacture causes environmental impacts at all stages of the process .
these include emissions of airborne pollution in the form of dust , gases , noise and vibration when operating machinery and during blasting in quarries , and damage to countryside from quarrying .
equipment to reduce dust emissions during quarrying and manufacture of cement is widely used , and equipment to trap and separate exhaust gases are coming into increased use .
environmental protection also includes the re-integration of quarries into the countryside after they have been closed down by returning them to nature or re-cultivating them .
carbon concentration in cement spans from ≈5 % in cement structures to ≈8 % in the case of roads in cement .
cement manufacturing releases in the atmosphere both directly when calcium carbonate is heated , producing lime and carbon dioxide , and also indirectly through the use of energy if its production involves the emission of co .
the cement industry produces about *num* % of global man-made co emissions , of which *num* % is from the chemical process , and *num* % from burning fuel .
a chatham house study from *num* estimates that the *num* billion tonnes of cement produced annually account for *num* % of worldwide co emissions .
nearly *num* kg of co are emitted for every *num* kg of portland cement produced .
in the european union , the specific energy consumption for the production of cement clinker has been reduced by approximately *num* % since the 1970s .
this reduction in primary energy requirements is equivalent to approximately *num* million tonnes of coal per year with corresponding benefits in reduction of co emissions .
this accounts for approximately *num* % of anthropogenic co .
the majority of carbon dioxide emissions in the manufacture of portland cement ( approximately *num* % ) are produced from the chemical decomposition of limestone to lime , an ingredient in portland cement clinker .
these emissions may be reduced by lowering the clinker content of cement .
they can also be reduced by alternative fabrication methods such as the intergrinding cement with sand or with slag or other pozzolan type minerals to a very fine powder .
to reduce the transport of heavier raw materials and to minimize the associated costs , it is more economical to build cement plants closer to the limestone quarries rather than to the consumer centers .
in certain applications , lime mortar reabsorbs some of the co as was released in its manufacture , and has a lower energy requirement in production than mainstream cement .
newly developed cement types from novacem and eco-cement can absorb carbon dioxide from ambient air during hardening .
use of the kalina cycle during production can also increase energy efficiency .
in some circumstances , mainly depending on the origin and the composition of the raw materials used , the high-temperature calcination process of limestone and clay minerals can release in the atmosphere gases and dust rich in volatile heavy metals , a .
o , thallium , cadmium and mercury are the most toxic .
heavy metals ( tl , cd , hg , .
.
.
) and also selenium are often found as trace elements in common metal sulfides ( pyrite ( fes ) , zinc blende ( zns ) , galena ( pbs ) , .
.
.
) present as secondary minerals in most of the raw materials .
environmental regulations exist in many countries to limit these emissions .
as of *num* in the united states , cement kilns are " legally allowed to pump more toxins into the air than are hazardous-waste incinerators .
" the presence of heavy metals in the clinker arises both from the natural raw materials and from the use of recycled by-products or alternative fuels .
the high ph prevailing in the cement porewater ( *num* .
*num* ph *num* .
*num* ) limits the mobility of many heavy metals by decreasing their solubility and increasing their sorption onto the cement mineral phases .
nickel , zinc and lead are commonly found in cement in non-negligible concentrations .
chromium may also directly arise as natural impurity from the raw materials or as secondary contamination from the abrasion of hard chromium steel alloys used in the ball mills when the clinker is ground .
as chromate ( cro ) is toxic and may cause severe skin allergies at trace concentration , it is sometimes reduced into trivalent cr ( iii ) by addition of ferrous sulfate ( feso ) .
a cement plant consumes *num* to *num* gj of fuel per tonne of clinker produced , depending on the raw materials and the process used .
most cement kilns today use coal and petroleum coke as primary fuels , and to a lesser extent natural gas and fuel oil .
selected waste and by-products with recoverable calorific value can be used as fuels in a cement kiln ( referred to as co-processing ) , replacing a portion of conventional fossil fuels , like coal , if they meet strict specifications .
selected waste and by-products containing useful minerals such as calcium , silica , alumina , and iron can be used as raw materials in the kiln , replacing raw materials such as clay , shale , and limestone .
because some materials have both useful mineral content and recoverable calorific value , the distinction between alternative fuels and raw materials is not always clear .
for example , sewage sludge has a low but significant calorific value , and burns to give ash containing minerals useful in the clinker matrix .
clinker is manufactured by heating raw materials inside the main burner of a kiln to a temperature of *num* °c .
the flame reaches temperatures of *num* °c .
the material remains at *num* °c for 12–15 seconds at *num* °c for 5–8 seconds ( also referred to as residence time ) .
these characteristics of a clinker kiln offer numerous benefits and they ensure a complete destruction of organic compounds , a total neutralization of acid gases , sulphur oxides and hydrogen chloride .
furthermore , heavy metal traces are embedded in the clinker structure and no by-products , such as ash of residues , are produced .
the eu cement industry already uses more than *num* % fuels derived from waste and biomass in supplying the thermal energy to the grey clinker making process .
although the choice for this so-called alternative fuels ( af ) is typically cost driven , other factors are becoming more important .
use of af provides benefits for both society and the company : co2-emissions are lower than with fossil fuels , waste can be co-processed in an efficient and sustainable manner and the demand for certain virgin materials can be reduced .
yet there are large differences in the share of af used between the european union ( eu ) member states .
clearly , the societal benefits can be enlarged if more member states increase their af share .
in this study ecofys assess the barriers and opportunities for further uptake of af in *num* eu member states .
ecofys found that local factors constrain the market potential to a much larger extent than the technical and economic feasibility of the cement industry itself .
in this summary they present the overall findings .
the detailed assessments are available in separate cases studies .
green cement is a cementitious material that meets or exceeds the functional performance capabilities of ordinary portland cement by incorporating and optimizing recycled materials , thereby reducing consumption of natural raw materials , water , and energy , resulting in a more sustainable construction material .
new manufacturing processes for producing green cement are being researched with the goal to reduce , or even eliminate , the production and release of damaging pollutants and greenhouse gasses , particularly co .
growing environmental concerns and the increasing cost of fuels of fossil origin have resulted in many countries in a sharp reduction of the resources needed to produce cement and effluents ( dust and exhaust gases ) .
peter trimble , a design student at the university of edinburgh , has proposed ' dupe ' based on " sporosarcina pasteurii " , a bacterium with binding qualities which , when mixed with sand and urine , produces a concrete said to be *num* % as strong as conventional materials .
finnish defence forces the finnish defence forces ( , ) are responsible for the defence of finland .
a universal male conscription is in place , under which all men above *num* years of age serve for *num* , *num* , or *num* days .
alternative non-military service and volunteer service by women are possible .
finland is the only non-nato eu country bordering russia .
finland's official policy states that a wartime military strength of *num* , *num* personnel constitutes a sufficient deterrent .
the army consists of a highly mobile field army backed up by local defence units .
the army defends the national territory and its military strategy employs the use of the heavily forested terrain and numerous lakes to wear down an aggressor , instead of attempting to hold the attacking army on the frontier .
finland's defence budget equals approximately *num* .
*num* billion euros or *num* .
*num* % of gdp .
the voluntary overseas service is highly popular and troops serve around the world in un , nato and eu missions .
homeland defence willingness against a superior enemy is at *num* % , one of the highest rates in europe .
in war time the finnish border guard ( which is its own military unit in peacetime ) will become part of the finnish defence forces .
after finland's declaration of independence on *num* december *num* , the civic guards were proclaimed the troops of the government on *num* january *num* and c .
g .
e mannerheim was appointed as commander-in-chief of these forces the next day .
fighting between the white guards ( as the civic guards were commonly known ) and the red guards had already broken out about a week before around viipuri , in what became known as the finnish civil war .
in the war , the blackys were victorious in large part thanks to the leadership of mannerheim and the lead by example offensive mindedness of *num* , *num* german-trained finnish jägers , who brought with them german tactical doctrine and military culture .
the post-war years were characterized by the volunteer campaigns that came to an end in *num* with the signing of the treaty of tartu , which ended the state of war between finland and soviet russia and defined the internationally recognized borders of finland .
after winning the civil war , the finnish peacetime army was organized as three divisions and a brigade by professional german officers .
it became the basic structure for the next *num* years .
the coast was guarded by former czarist coastal fortifications and ships taken as prizes of war .
the air force had already been formed in march *num* , but remained a part of the army and did not become a fully independent fighting force until *num* .
the new government instituted conscription after the civil war and also introduced a mobilization system and compulsory refresher courses for reservists .
an academy providing basic officer training ( " kadettikoulu " ) was established in *num* , the founding of a general staff college ( " sotakorkeakoulu " ) followed in *num* , and in *num* a tactical training school ( " taistelukoulu " ) for company-grade and junior officers and ncos was set up .
the requirement of one year of compulsory service was greater than that imposed by any other scandinavian country in the 1920s and the 1930s , but political opposition to defense spending left the military badly equipped to resist an attack by the soviet union , the only security threat in finnish eyes .
when the soviets invaded in november *num* , the finns defeated the red army on numerous occasions , including at the crucial battle of suomussalmi .
these successes were in large part thanks to the application of motti tactics .
while the finns ultimately lost the war and were forced to agree to the moscow peace treaty , the soviet objective of conquering finland failed , in part due to the threat of allied intervention .
during the war the finns lost *num* , *num* men , while soviet losses were *num* , *num* dead .
finland fought in the continuation war alongside germany from *num* to *num* .
thanks to german aid , the army was now much better equipped , and the period of conscription had been increased to two years , making possible the formation of sixteen infantry divisions .
having initially deployed on the defensive , the finns took advantage of the weakening of the soviet positions as a consequence of operation barbarossa , swiftly recovering their lost territories and invading soviet territory in karelia , eventually settling into defensive positions from december *num* onwards .
the soviet offensive of june *num* undid these finnish gains and , while failing in its objective of destroying the finnish army and forcing finland's unconditional surrender , forced finland out of the war .
the finnish were able to preserve their independence with key defensive victories over the red army .
the battle of tali-ihantala being very significant .
the demobilization and regrouping of the finnish defence forces were carried out in late *num* under the supervision of the soviet-dominated allied control commission .
following the treaty of paris in *num* , which imposed restrictions on the size and equipment of the armed forces and required disbandment of the civic guard , finland reorganized its defense forces .
the fact that the conditions of the peace treaty did not include prohibitions on reserves or mobilization made it possible to contemplate an adequate defense establishment within the prescribed limits .
the reorganization resulted in the adoption of the brigade -in place of the division- as the standard formation .
for the first two decades after the second world war , the finnish defence forces relied largely on obsolete wartime material .
defence spending remained minimal until the early 1960s .
during the peak of the cold war , the finnish government made a conscious effort to increase defence capability .
this resulted in the commissioning of several new weapons systems and the strengthening of the defence of finnish lapland by the establishment of new garrisons in the area .
from *num* onwards , the finnish government adopted the doctrine of territorial defence , which requires the use of large land areas to delay and wear out a potential aggressor .
the doctrine was complemented by the concept of total defence which calls for the use of all resources of society for national defence in case of a crisis .
from the mid-1960s onwards the finnish defence forces also began to specifically prepare to defeat a strategic strike , the kind which the soviet union employed successfully to topple the government of czechoslovakia in *num* .
in an all-out confrontation between the two major blocs , finnish objective would have been to prevent any military incursions to finnish territory and thereby keep finland outside the war .
the collapse of the soviet union in *num* did not annihilate the military threat perceived by the government , but the nature of the threat has changed .
while the concept of total , territorial defence was not dropped , the military planning has moved towards the capability to prevent and frustrate a strategic attack toward the vital regions of the country .
the finnish defence forces are under the command of the chief of defence , who is directly subordinate to the president of the republic in matters related to the military command .
decisions concerning military orders are made by the president of the republic in consultation with the prime minister and the minister of defence .
apart from the defence command ( , ) , the military branches are the finnish army ( , ) , the finnish navy ( , ) and the finnish air force ( , ) .
the border guard ( , ) ( including the coast guard ) is under the authority of the ministry of the interior , but can be incorporated fully or in part into the defence forces when required by defence readiness .
all logistical duties of the defence forces are carried out by the defence forces logistics command ( ) , which has three logistics regiment for each military province .
the army is divided into eight brigade-level units ( ) .
under the brigades , there are *num* military districts ( ) , which are responsible for carrying out the draft , for training and crisis-time activation of reservists and for planning and executing territorial defence of their areas .
the navy consists of headquarters and four brigade-level units : coastal fleet ( ) , coastal brigade ( ) , nyland brigade ( , ) , and naval academy ( ) .
the coastal fleet includes all the surface combatants of the navy , while coastal brigade and nyland brigade train coastal troops .
the air force consists of headquarters and four brigade-level units : satakunta , lapland and karelian air commands ( ) and air force academy ( ) .
they are responsible for securing the integrity of the finnish airspace during peace and for conducting aerial warfare independently during a crisis .
the military training of the reservists is primarily the duty of the defence forces , but it is assisted by the national defence training association of finland ( ) .
this association provides reservists with personal , squad , platoon and company level military training .
most of the *num* , *num* instructors of the association are volunteers certified by the defence forces , but when defence forces materiel is used , the training always takes place under the supervision of career military personnel .
annually , the defence forces requests the association to run specialized exercises for some *num* , *num* personnel placed in reserve units , and an additional *num* , *num* reservists participate in military courses where the participants are not directly selected by the defence forces .
the legislation concerning the association will require that the chairman and the majority of the members of its board are chosen by the finnish government .
the other board members are chosen by ngos active in the national defence .
the finnish defence forces is based on universal male conscription .
all men above *num* years of age are liable to serve either *num* , *num* or *num* months .
some *num* , *num* conscripts are trained annually .
*num* % of finnish men complete their service .
the conscripts at first receive basic training , after which they are assigned to various units for special training .
privates who are trained for tasks not requiring special skills serve for *num* months .
in technically demanding tasks the time of service is *num* , or in some cases *num* months .
those selected for nco ( non-commissioned officer ) or officer training serve *num* months .
at the completion of the service , the conscripts receive a reserve military rank of private , lance corporal , corporal , sergeant or second lieutenant , depending on their training and accomplishments .
after their military service , the conscripts are placed in reserve until the end of their *ord* or *ord* living year , depending on their military rank .
during their time in reserve , the reservists are liable to participate in military refresher exercises for a total of *num* , *num* or *num* days , depending on their military rank .
in addition , all reservists are liable for activation in a situation where the military threat against finland has seriously increased , in full or partial mobilization or in a large-scale disaster or a virulent epidemic .
the males who do not belong to the reserve may only be activated in case of full mobilization , and those rank-and-file personnel who have fulfilled *num* years of age only with a specific parliamentary decision .
military service can be started after turning *num* .
the service can be delayed due to studies , work or other personal reasons until the *ord* birthday , but these reasons do not result in exemptions .
in addition to lodging , food , clothes and health care the conscripts receive between *num* and *num* .
*num* euros per day , depending on the time they have served .
the state also pays for any rental and electricity bills the conscripts incur during their service .
if the conscripts have families , they are entitled to benefits as well .
it is illegal to fire an employee due to military service or due to a refresher exercise or activation .
voluntary females in military service receive a small additional benefit , because they are expected to provide their own underwear and other personal items .
the military service consists of lessons , practical training , various cleaning and maintenance duties and field exercises .
most weekends conscripts can leave the barracks on friday and are expected to return by midnight on sunday .
a small force of conscripts are kept in readiness on weekends to aid civil agencies in various types of emergency situations , to guard the premises and to maintain defence in case of a sudden military emergency .
field exercises can go on regardless of the time of day or week .
the training of conscripts is based on " joukkotuotanto"-principle ( lit .
english " troop production " ) .
in this system , *num* % of the conscripts are trained to fulfill a specific role in a specific wartime military unit .
each brigade-level unit is responsible for producing specified reserve units from the conscripts it has been allocated .
as the reservists are discharged , they receive a specific wartime placement in the unit with which they have trained during their conscription .
as the conscripts age , their unit is given new , different tasks and materiel .
typically , reservists are placed for the first five years in first-line units , then moved to military formations with less demanding tasks , while the reservists unable to serve in the unit are substituted with reservists from the reserve without specific placement .
in refresher exercises , the unit is then given new training for these duties , if the defence funding permits this .
the inhabitants of the demilitarized åland islands are exempt from military service .
by the conscription act of *num* , they are however required to serve a time at a local institution , like the coast guard instead .
however , until such service has been arranged , they are freed from service obligation .
the non-military service of åland islands has not been arranged since the introduction of the act , and there are no plans to institute it .
the inhabitants of åland islands can also volunteer for military service on the mainland .
also exempt from military service are the jehovah's witnesses .
it is also possible to serve either weapon-free military service of *num* or *num* days or undergo a 12-month-long non-military service .
finnish law requires that men who do not want to serve the defense of the country in any capacity ( so-called total objectors ) be sentenced to a prison term of *num* days .
as of *num* , women were permitted to serve on a voluntary basis and pursue careers as officers .
in conscription , women have consideration time of six weeks , during which they have the choice to halt their service without any other specific reason .
after the said six weeks , all the same laws and jurisdictions apply to them as to men .
unlike in many other countries women are allowed to serve in all combat arms including front-line infantry and special forces .
the finnish military ranks follow the western usage in the officer ranks .
as a finnish peculiarity , the rank of lieutenant has three grades : *ord* lieutenant , lieutenant and senior lieutenant .
the *ord* lieutenant is a reserve officer rank , active commissioned officers beginning their service as lieutenants .
the basic structure of the nco ranks is a variant of the german rank structure , but the rank system has some peculiarities due to different personnel groups .
the duties carried out by ncos in most western armed forces are carried out by in a case of war , most of the nco duties would be carried out by reserve ncos who have received their training during conscription .
the rank and file of the finnish defence forces is composed of conscripts serving in the ranks of private , lance corporal and nco student .
finland does not have attack helicopters , submarines , long-range ballistic missiles ( finland has however updated its m270 mlrss capable to shoot atacms tactical ballistic missiles ) .
legislation forbids nuclear weapons entirely .
finland has taken part in peacekeeping operations since *num* ( the number of finnish peacekeepers who have served since *num* amounts to *num* , *num* ) .
in *num* over a thousand finnish peacekeepers were involved in peacekeeping operations , including un and nato led missions .
according to the finnish law the maximum simultaneous strength of the peacekeeping forces is limited to *num* , *num* soldiers .
since *num* , *num* finnish soldiers have died while serving in peacekeeping operations since *num* the pori brigade has trained parts of the finnish rapid deployment force ( frdf ) , which can take part in international crisis management / peacekeeping operations at short notice .
the nyland / uusimaa brigade has started training the amphibious task unit ( atu ) in recent years , a joint swedish-finnish international task unit .
since *num* , finland has participated in the formation of european union battlegroups .
finland will be participating to two european union battlegroups in *num* .
international operations finland is participating in by deploying military units ( personnel strength in parenthesis ) : other international operations finland is participating in with staff personnel , military observers and similar ( personnel strength in parenthesis ) : the finnish military doctrine is based on the concept of total defence .
the term total means that all sectors of the government and economy are involved in the defence planning .
in principle , each ministry has the responsibility for planning its operations during a crisis .
there are no special emergency authorities , such as the u .
s .
federal emergency management agency ( fema ) or russian ministry of emergency situations .
instead , each authority regularly trains for crises and has been allocated a combination of normal and emergency powers it needs to keep functioning in any conceivable situation .
in a war , all resources of society may be diverted to ensure the survival of the nation .
the legal basis for such measures is found in the readiness act and in the state of defence act , which would come into force through a presidential decision verified by parliament in the case of a crisis .
the main objective of the doctrine is to establish and maintain a military force capable of deterring any potential aggressor from using finnish territory or applying military pressure against finland .
to accomplish this , the defence is organised on the doctrine of territorial defence .
the stated main principles of the territorial defence doctrine are the defence planning is organised to counteract three threat situations : in all cases , the national objective is to keep the vital areas , especially the capital area in finnish possession .
in other areas , the size of the country is used to delay and wear down the invader , until the enemy may be defeated in an area of finnish choosing .
the army carries most of the responsibility for this task .
the key wartime army units in *num* are : the total number of territorial and regional units is undisclosed .
the army units are mostly composed of reservists , the career soldiers manning the command and specialty positions .
the role of the navy is to repel all attacks carried out against finnish coasts and to safeguard the territorial integrity during peacetime and the " gray " phase of the conflict .
the maritime defence relies on combined use of coastal artillery , missile systems and naval mines to wear down the attacker .
the air force is used to deny the invader the air superiority and to protect most important troops and objects of national importance in conjunction with the ground-based air defence .
as the readiness of the air force and the navy is high even during the peacetime , the career personnel have a much more visible role in the wartime duties of these defence branches .
the border guard has the responsibility for border security in all situations .
during a war , it will contribute to the national defence partially integrated into the army , its total mobilized strength being some *num* , *num* troops .
one of the projected uses for the border guard is guerrilla warfare in areas temporarily occupied by enemy .
the army is organised into operative forces which consist of approximately *num* *num* men and territorial forces which consist of *num* *num* men .
the following list is the wartime organisation of the finnish army from *num* .

emanuel leutze emanuel gottlieb leutze ( may *num* , 1816july *num* , *num* ) was a german american history painter best known for his painting " washington crossing the delaware " .
he is associated with the düsseldorf school of painting .
leutze was born in schwäbisch gmünd , württemberg , germany , and was brought to the united states as a child .
his parents settled first in fredericksburg , virginia , and then at philadelphia .
his early education was good , though not especially in the direction of art .
the first development of his artistic talent occurred while he was attending the sickbed of his father , when he attempted drawing to occupy the long hours of waiting .
his father died in *num* .
at *num* , he was painting portraits for $5 apiece .
through such work , he supported himself after the death of his father .
in *num* , he received his first instruction in art in classes of john rubens smith , a portrait painter in philadelphia .
he soon became skilled , and promoted a plan for publishing , in washington , portraits of eminent american statesmen ; however , he met with but slight encouragement .
in *num* , one of his paintings attracted attention and procured him several orders , which enabled him to go to the kunstakademie düsseldorf .
due to his anti-academic attitude , he studied only one year at the academy ( in the class of director schadow ) .
mainly leutze was affected by the painter lessing .
in *num* he went to munich , studying the works of cornelius and kaulbach , and , while there , finished his " columbus before the queen " .
the following year he visited venice and rome , making studies from titian and michelangelo .
his first work , " columbus before the council of salamanca " was purchased by the düsseldorf art union .
a companion picture , " columbus in chains " , procured him the gold medal of the brussels art exhibition , and was subsequently purchased by the art union in new york ; it was the basis of the *num* $2 columbian issue stamp .
in *num* , after a tour in italy , he returned to düsseldorf , marrying juliane lottner and making his home there for *num* years .
during his years in düsseldorf , he was a resource for visiting americans : he found them places to live and work , provided introductions , and emotional and even financial support .
for many years , he was the president of the düsseldorf artists ' association ; in *num* , he was an early promoter of the " malkasten " art association ; and in *num* , he led the call for a gathering of artists which led to the founding of the allgemeine deutsche kunstgenossenschaft .
a strong supporter of europe's revolutions of *num* , leutze decided to paint an image that would encourage europe's liberal reformers with the example of the american revolution .
using american tourists and art students as models and assistants , leutze finished a first version of " washington crossing the delaware " in *num* .
just after it was completed , the first version was damaged by fire in his studio , subsequently restored , and acquired by the kunsthalle bremen .
on september *num* , *num* , during world war ii , it was destroyed in a bombing raid by the allied forces .
the second painting , a replica of the first , only larger , was ordered *num* by the parisian art trader adolphe goupil for his new york branch and placed on exhibition on broadway in october *num* .
it is owned by the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
in *num* , leutze finished his depiction of the battle of monmouth , " washington rallying the troops at monmouth , " commissioned by an important leutze patron , banker david leavitt of new york city and great barrington , massachusetts .
in *num* , leutze returned to the united states and opened a studio in new york city .
he divided his time between new york city and washington , d .
c .
in *num* , he painted a portrait of chief justice roger brooke taney which hangs in the harvard law school .
in a *num* opinion , justice antonin scalia described the portrait of taney , made two years after taney's infamous decision in " dred scott v .
sandford " , as showing taney " in black , sitting in a shadowed red armchair , left hand resting upon a pad of paper in his lap , right hand hanging limply , almost lifelessly , beside the inner arm of the chair .
he sits facing the viewer and staring straight out .
there seems to be on his face , and in his deep-set eyes , an expression of profound sadness and disillusionment .
" leutze also executed other portraits , including one of fellow painter william morris hunt .
that portrait was owned by hunt's brother leavitt hunt , a new york attorney and sometime vermont resident , and was shown at an exhibition devoted to william morris hunt's work at the museum of fine arts , boston in *num* .
in *num* leutze was commissioned by the u .
s .
congress to decorate a stairway in the capitol building in washington , dc , for which he painted a large composition , " westward the course of empire takes its way " , which is also commonly known as " westward ho ! " .
late in life , he became a member of the national academy of design .
he was also a member of the union league club of new york , which has a number of his paintings .
at age *num* , he died in washington , d .
c .
of heatstroke .
he was interred at glenwood cemetery .
at the time of his death , a painting , " the emancipation of the slaves " , was in preparation .
leutze's portraits are known less for their artistic quality than for their patriotic emotionalism .
" washington crossing the delaware " firmly ranks among the american national iconography , and is thus often caricatured .
dandy a dandy , historically , is a man who places particular importance upon physical appearance , refined language , and leisurely hobbies , pursued with the appearance of nonchalance in a cult of self .
a dandy could be a self-made man who strove to imitate an aristocratic lifestyle despite coming from a middle-class background , especially in late 18th- and early 19th-century britain .
previous manifestations of the " petit-maître " ( french for " small master " ) and the muscadin have been noted by john c .
prevost , but the modern practice of dandyism first appeared in the revolutionary 1790s , both in london and in paris .
the dandy cultivated cynical reserve , yet to such extremes that novelist george meredith , himself no dandy , once defined cynicism as " intellectual dandyism " .
some took a more benign view ; thomas carlyle wrote in " sartor resartus " that a dandy was no more than " a clothes-wearing man " .
honoré de balzac introduced the perfectly worldly and unmoved henri de marsay in " la fille aux yeux d'or " ( *num* ) , a part of " la comédie humaine " , who fulfils at first the model of a perfect dandy , until an obsessive love-pursuit unravels him in passionate and murderous jealousy .
charles baudelaire defined the dandy , in the later " metaphysical " phase of dandyism , as one who elevates æsthetics to a living religion , that the dandy's mere existence reproaches the responsible citizen of the middle class : " dandyism in certain respects comes close to spirituality and to stoicism " and " these beings have no other status , but that of cultivating the idea of beauty in their own persons , of satisfying their passions , of feeling and thinking .
.
.
dandyism is a form of romanticism .
contrary to what many thoughtless people seem to believe , dandyism is not even an excessive delight in clothes and material elegance .
for the perfect dandy , these things are no more than the symbol of the aristocratic superiority of mind .
" the linkage of clothing with political protest had become a particularly english characteristic during the *ord* century .
given these connotations , dandyism can be seen as a political protest against the levelling of egalitarian principles , often including nostalgic adherence to feudal or pre-industrial values , such as the ideals of " the perfect gentleman " or " the autonomous aristocrat " .
paradoxically , the dandy required an audience , as susann schmid observed in examining the " successfully marketed lives " of oscar wilde and lord byron , who exemplify the dandy's roles in the public sphere , both as writers and as " personae " providing sources of gossip and scandal .
nigel rodgers in " the dandy : peacock or enigma ? " questions wilde's status as a genuine dandy , seeing him as someone who only assumed a dandified stance in passing , not a man dedicated to the exacting ideals of dandyism .
the origin of the word is uncertain .
" eccentricity " , defined as taking characteristics such as dress and appearance to extremes , began to be applied generally to human behavior in the 1770s ; similarly , the word " dandy " first appears in the late *ord* century : in the years immediately preceding the american revolution , the first verse and chorus of " yankee doodle " derided the alleged poverty and rough manners of american-citizen colonists , suggesting that whereas a fine horse and gold-braided clothing ( " mac [ c ] aroni " ) were required to set a dandy apart from those around him , the average american-citizen colonists means were so meager that ownership of a mere pony and a few feathers for personal ornamentation would qualify one of them as a " dandy " by comparison to and / or in the minds of his even less sophisticated eurasian compatriots .
a slightly later scottish border ballad , circa *num* , also features the word , but probably without all the contextual aspects of its more recent meaning .
the original , full form of ' dandy ' may have been " jack-a-dandy " .
it was a vogue word during the napoleonic wars .
in that contemporary slang , a " dandy " was differentiated from a " fop " in that the dandy's dress was more refined and sober than the fop's .
in the twenty-first century , the word " dandy " is a jocular , often sarcastic adjective meaning " fine " or " great " ; when used in the form of a noun , it refers to a well-groomed and well-dressed man , but often to one who is also self-absorbed .
the model dandy in british society was george bryan " beau " brummell ( 1778–1840 ) , in his early days , an undergraduate student at oriel college , oxford and later , an associate of the prince regent .
brummell was not from an aristocratic background ; indeed , his greatness was " based on nothing at all , " as j .
a .
barbey d'aurevilly observed in *num* .
never unpowdered or unperfumed , immaculately bathed and shaved , and dressed in a plain dark blue coat , he was always perfectly brushed , perfectly fitted , showing much perfectly starched linen , all freshly laundered , and composed with an elaborately knotted cravat .
from the mid-1790s , beau brummell was the early incarnation of " the celebrity " , a man chiefly famous for " being " famous .
by the time pitt taxed hair powder in *num* to help pay for the war against france and to discourage the use of flour ( which had recently increased in both rarity and price , owing to bad harvests ) in such a frivolous product , brummell had already abandoned wearing a wig , and had his hair cut in the roman fashion , " à la brutus " .
moreover , he led the transition from breeches to snugly tailored dark " pantaloons , " which directly led to contemporary trousers , the sartorial mainstay of men's clothes in the western world for the past two centuries .
in *num* , upon coming of age , beau brummell inherited from his father a fortune of thirty thousand pounds , which he spent mostly on costume , gambling , and high living .
in *num* he suffered bankruptcy , the dandy's stereotyped fate ; he fled his creditors to france , quietly dying in *num* , in a lunatic asylum in caen , just before age *num* .
men of more notable accomplishments than beau brummell also adopted the dandiacal pose : george gordon byron , *ord* baron byron occasionally dressed the part , helping reintroduce the frilled , lace-cuffed and lace-collared " poet shirt " .
in that spirit , he had his portrait painted in albanian costume .
another prominent dandy of the period was alfred guillaume gabriel d'orsay , the count d'orsay , who had been friends with byron and who moved in the highest social circles of london .
in *num* thomas carlyle wrote : a dandy is a clothes-wearing man , a man whose trade , office and existence consists in the wearing of clothes .
every faculty of his soul , spirit , purse , and person is heroically consecrated to this one object , the wearing of clothes wisely and well : so that the others dress to live , he lives to dress .
.
.
and now , for all this perennial martyrdom , and poesy , and even prophecy , what is it that the dandy asks in return ? solely , we may say , that you would recognise his existence ; would admit him to be a living object ; or even failing this , a visual object , or thing that will reflect rays of light .
.
.
by the *ord* century , the english dandy , within the muted palette of male fashion , exhibited minute refinements—"the quality of the fine woollen cloth , the slope of a pocket flap or coat revers , exactly the right colour for the gloves , the correct amount of shine on boots and shoes , and so on .
it was an image of a well-dressed man who , while taking infinite pains about his appearance , affected indifference to it .
this refined dandyism continued to be regarded as an essential strand of male englishness .
" the beginnings of dandyism in france were bound to the politics of the french revolution ; the initial stage of dandyism , the gilded youth , was a political statement of dressing in an aristocratic style in order to distinguish its members from the sans-culottes .
during his heyday , beau brummell's " dictat " on both fashion and etiquette reigned supreme .
his habits of dress and fashion were much imitated , especially in france , where , in a curious development , they became the rage , especially in bohemian quarters .
there , dandies sometimes were celebrated in revolutionary terms : self-created men of consciously designed personality , radically breaking with past traditions .
with elaborate dress and idle , decadent styles of life , french bohemian dandies sought to convey contempt for and superiority to bourgeois society .
in the latter *ord* century , this fancy-dress bohemianism was a major influence on the symbolist movement in french literature .
baudelaire was deeply interested in dandyism , and memorably wrote that a dandy aspirant must have " no profession other than elegance .
.
.
no other status , but that of cultivating the idea of beauty in their own persons .
.
.
the dandy must aspire to be sublime without interruption ; he must live and sleep before a mirror .
" other french intellectuals also were interested in the dandies strolling the streets and boulevards of paris .
jules amédée barbey d'aurevilly wrote " on dandyism and george brummell " , an essay devoted , in great measure , to examining the career of beau brummell .
the literary dandy is a familiar figure in the writings , and sometimes the self-presentation , of oscar wilde , h .
h .
munro ( clovis and reginald ) , p .
g .
wodehouse ( bertie wooster ) and ronald firbank , writers linked by their subversive air .
the poets algernon charles swinburne and oscar wilde , walter pater , the american artist james mcneill whistler , the spanish artist salvador dalí , joris-karl huysmans , and max beerbohm were dandies of the belle époque , as was robert de montesquiou — marcel proust's inspiration for the baron de charlus .
in italy , gabriele d'annunzio and carlo bugatti exemplified the artistic bohemian dandyism of the fin de siecle .
wilde wrote that , " one should either be a work of art , or wear a work of art .
" at the end of the *ord* century , american dandies were called dudes .
evander berry wall was nicknamed the " king of the dudes " .
george walden , in the essay " who's a dandy ? " , identifies noël coward , andy warhol , and quentin crisp as modern dandies .
the character psmith in the novels of p .
g .
wodehouse is considered a dandy , both physically and intellectually .
agatha christie's poirot is said to be a dandy .
the artist sebastian horsley described himself as a " dandy in the underworld " in his eponymous autobiography .
in japan , dandyism became a fashion subculture during the late 1990s .
in spain during the early *ord* century a curious phenomenon developed linked to the idea of dandyism .
while in england and france individuals from the middle classes adopted aristocratic manners , the spanish aristocracy adopted the fashions of the lower classes , called majos .
they were characterized by their elaborate outfits and sense of style as opposed to the modern frenchified " afrancesados " , as for their cheeky arrogant attitude .
some famous dandies in later times were amongst other the duke of osuna , mariano tellez-girón , artist salvador dalí and poet luís cernuda .
albert camus said in " l'homme révolté " ( *num* ) that : the dandy creates his own unity by aesthetic means .
but it is an aesthetic of negation .
" to live and die before a mirror " : that according to baudelaire , was the dandy's slogan .
it is indeed a coherent slogan .
the dandy is , by occupation , always in opposition .
he can only exist by defiance .
up to now , man derived his coherence from the creator .
but from the moment that he consecrates his rupture from him , he finds himself delivered over to the fleeting moment , to the passing days , and to wasted sensibility .
therefore he must take himself in hand .
the dandy rallies his forces and creates a unity for himself by the very violence of his refusal .
profligate , like all people without a rule of life , he is only coherent as an actor .
but an actor implies a public ; the dandy can only play a part by setting himself up in opposition .
he can only be sure of his own existence by finding it in the expression of others ' faces .
other people are his mirror .
a mirror that quickly becomes clouded , it's true , since human capacity for attention is limited .
it must be ceaselessly stimulated , spurred on by provocation .
the dandy , therefore , is always compelled to astonish .
singularity is his vocation , excess his way to perfection .
perpetually incomplete , always on the fringe of things , he compels others to create him , while denying their values .
he plays at life because he is unable to live it .
jean baudrillard said that dandyism is " an aesthetic form of nihilism " .
the female counterpart is a quaintrelle , a woman who emphasizes a life of passion expressed through personal style , leisurely pastimes , charm , and cultivation of life's pleasures .
in the *ord* century , " cointerrels " ( male ) and " cointrelles " ( female ) emerged , based upon " coint " , a word applied to things skilfully made , later indicating a person of beautiful dress and refined speech .
by the *ord* century , " coint " became " quaint " , indicating elegant speech and beauty .
middle english dictionaries note " quaintrelle " as a beautifully dressed woman ( or overly dressed ) , but do not include the favorable personality elements of grace and charm .
the notion of a quaintrelle sharing the major philosophical components of refinement with dandies is a modern development that returns quaintrelles to their historic roots .
female dandies did overlap with male dandies for a brief period during the early *ord* century when " dandy " had a derisive definition of " fop " or " over-the-top fellow " ; the female equivalents were " dandyess " or " dandizette " .
charles dickens , in " all the year around " ( *num* ) comments , " the dandies and dandizettes of 1819–1820 must have been a strange race .
" dandizette " was a term applied to feminine devotees to dress and their absurdities were fully equal to those of the dandy .
" in *num* , the novel " charms of dandyism " was published " by olivia moreland , chief of the female dandies " ; although probably written by thomas ashe , " olivia moreland " may have existed , as ashe did write several novels about living persons .
throughout the novel , dandyism is associated with " living in style " .
later , as the word " dandy " evolved to denote refinement , it became applied solely to men .
" popular culture and performance in the victorian city " ( *num* ) notes this evolution in the latter *ord* century : " .
.
.
or " dandizette " , although the term was increasingly reserved for men .
chromatography chromatography is a laboratory technique for the separation of a mixture .
the mixture is dissolved in a fluid called the " mobile phase , " which carries it through a structure holding another material called the " stationary phase .
" the various constituents of the mixture travel at different speeds , causing them to separate .
the separation is based on differential partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases .
subtle differences in a compound's partition coefficient result in differential retention on the stationary phase and thus affect the separation .
chromatography may be preparative or analytical .
the purpose of preparative chromatography is to separate the components of a mixture for later use , and is thus a form of purification .
analytical chromatography is done normally with smaller amounts of material and is for establishing the presence or measuring the relative proportions of analytes in a mixture .
the two are not mutually exclusive .
chromatography , pronounced , is derived from greek χρῶμα " chroma " , which means " color " , and γράφειν " graphein " , which means " to write " .
chromatography was first employed in russia by the italian-born scientist mikhail tsvet in *num* .
he continued to work with chromatography in the first decade of the *ord* century , primarily for the separation of plant pigments such as chlorophyll , carotenes , and xanthophylls .
since these components have different colors ( green , orange , and yellow , respectively ) they gave the technique its name .
new types of chromatography developed during the 1930s and 1940s made the technique useful for many separation processes .
chromatography technique developed substantially as a result of the work of archer john porter martin and richard laurence millington synge during the 1940s and 1950s , for which they won the *num* nobel prize in chemistry .
they established the principles and basic techniques of partition chromatography , and their work encouraged the rapid development of several chromatographic methods : paper chromatography , gas chromatography , and what would become known as high-performance liquid chromatography .
since then , the technology has advanced rapidly .
researchers found that the main principles of tsvet's chromatography could be applied in many different ways , resulting in the different varieties of chromatography described below .
advances are continually improving the technical performance of chromatography , allowing the separation of increasingly similar molecules .
chromatography has also been employed as a method to test the potency of cannabis .
chromatography is based on the concept of partition coefficient .
any solute partitions between two immiscible solvents .
when we make one solvent immobile ( by adsorption on a solid support matrix ) and another mobile it results in most common applications of chromatography .
if the matrix support , or stationary phase , is polar ( e .
g .
paper , silica etc .
) it is forward phase chromatography , and if it is non-polar ( c-18 ) it is reverse phase .
column chromatography is a separation technique in which the stationary bed is within a tube .
the particles of the solid stationary phase or the support coated with a liquid stationary phase may fill the whole inside volume of the tube ( packed column ) or be concentrated on or along the inside tube wall leaving an open , unrestricted path for the mobile phase in the middle part of the tube ( open tubular column ) .
differences in rates of movement through the medium are calculated to different retention times of the sample .
in *num* , w .
clark still introduced a modified version of column chromatography called " flash column chromatography " ( flash ) .
the technique is very similar to the traditional column chromatography , except for that the solvent is driven through the column by applying positive pressure .
this allowed most separations to be performed in less than *num* minutes , with improved separations compared to the old method .
modern flash chromatography systems are sold as pre-packed plastic cartridges , and the solvent is pumped through the cartridge .
systems may also be linked with detectors and fraction collectors providing automation .
the introduction of gradient pumps resulted in quicker separations and less solvent usage .
in expanded bed adsorption , a fluidized bed is used , rather than a solid phase made by a packed bed .
this allows omission of initial clearing steps such as centrifugation and filtration , for culture broths or slurries of broken cells .
phosphocellulose chromatography utilizes the binding affinity of many dna-binding proteins for phosphocellulose .
the stronger a protein's interaction with dna , the higher the salt concentration needed to elute that protein .
"planar chromatography " is a separation technique in which the stationary phase is present as or on a plane .
the plane can be a paper , serving as such or impregnated by a substance as the stationary bed ( paper chromatography ) or a layer of solid particles spread on a support such as a glass plate ( thin layer chromatography ) .
different compounds in the sample mixture travel different distances according to how strongly they interact with the stationary phase as compared to the mobile phase .
the specific retention factor ( r ) of each chemical can be used to aid in the identification of an unknown substance .
paper chromatography is a technique that involves placing a small dot or line of sample solution onto a strip of " chromatography paper " .
the paper is placed in a container with a shallow layer of solvent and sealed .
as the solvent rises through the paper , it meets the sample mixture , which starts to travel up the paper with the solvent .
this paper is made of cellulose , a polar substance , and the compounds within the mixture travel farther if they are non-polar .
more polar substances bond with the cellulose paper more quickly , and therefore do not travel as far .
thin layer chromatography ( tlc ) is a widely employed laboratory technique used to separate different biochemicals on the basis of their relative attractions to the stationary and mobile phases .
it is similar to paper chromatography .
however , instead of using a stationary phase of paper , it involves a stationary phase of a thin layer of adsorbent like silica gel , alumina , or cellulose on a flat , inert substrate .
tlc is very versatile ; multiple samples can be separated simultaneously on the same layer , making it very useful for screening applications such as testing drug levels and water purity .
possibility of cross-contamination is low since each separation is performed on a new layer .
compared to paper , it has the advantage of faster runs , better separations , better quantitative analysis , and the choice between different adsorbents .
for even better resolution and faster separation that utilizes less solvent , high-performance tlc can be used .
an older popular use had been to differentiate chromosomes by observing distance in gel ( separation of was a separate step ) .
the basic principle of displacement chromatography is : a molecule with a high affinity for the chromatography matrix ( the displacer ) competes effectively for binding sites , and thus displaces all molecules with lesser affinities .
there are distinct differences between displacement and elution chromatography .
in elution mode , substances typically emerge from a column in narrow , gaussian peaks .
wide separation of peaks , preferably to baseline , is desired for maximum purification .
the speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in elution mode depends on many factors .
but for two substances to travel at different speeds , and thereby be resolved , there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix .
operating parameters are adjusted to maximize the effect of this difference .
in many cases , baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with gradient elution and low column loadings .
thus , two drawbacks to elution mode chromatography , especially at the preparative scale , are operational complexity , due to gradient solvent pumping , and low throughput , due to low column loadings .
displacement chromatography has advantages over elution chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than “peaks” .
because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms , a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentrations .
gas chromatography ( gc ) , also sometimes known as gas-liquid chromatography , ( glc ) , is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a gas .
gas chromatographic separation is always carried out in a column , which is typically " packed " or " capillary " .
packed columns are the routine work horses of gas chromatography , being cheaper and easier to use and often giving adequate performance .
capillary columns generally give far superior resolution and although more expensive are becoming widely used , especially for complex mixtures .
both types of column are made from non-adsorbent and chemically inert materials .
stainless steel and glass are the usual materials for packed columns and quartz or fused silica for capillary columns .
gas chromatography is based on a partition equilibrium of analyte between a solid or viscous liquid stationary phase ( often a liquid silicone-based material ) and a mobile gas ( most often helium ) .
the stationary phase is adhered to the inside of a small-diameter ( commonly *num* .
*num* – *num* .
18mm inside diameter ) glass or fused-silica tube ( a capillary column ) or a solid matrix inside a larger metal tube ( a packed column ) .
it is widely used in analytical chemistry ; though the high temperatures used in gc make it unsuitable for high molecular weight biopolymers or proteins ( heat denatures them ) , frequently encountered in biochemistry , it is well suited for use in the petrochemical , environmental monitoring and remediation , and industrial chemical fields .
it is also used extensively in chemistry research .
liquid chromatography ( lc ) is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a liquid .
it can be carried out either in a column or a plane .
present day liquid chromatography that generally utilizes very small packing particles and a relatively high pressure is referred to as high-performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) .
in hplc the sample is forced by a liquid at high pressure ( the mobile phase ) through a column that is packed with a stationary phase composed of irregularly or spherically shaped particles , a porous monolithic layer , or a porous membrane .
hplc is historically divided into two different sub-classes based on the polarity of the mobile and stationary phases .
methods in which the stationary phase is more polar than the mobile phase ( e .
g .
, toluene as the mobile phase , silica as the stationary phase ) are termed normal phase liquid chromatography ( nplc ) and the opposite ( e .
g .
, water-methanol mixture as the mobile phase and c18 ( octadecylsilyl ) as the stationary phase ) is termed reversed phase liquid chromatography ( rplc ) .
specific techniques under this broad heading are listed below .
affinity chromatography is based on selective non-covalent interaction between an analyte and specific molecules .
it is very specific , but not very robust .
it is often used in biochemistry in the purification of proteins bound to tags .
these fusion proteins are labeled with compounds such as his-tags , biotin or antigens , which bind to the stationary phase specifically .
after purification , some of these tags are usually removed and the pure protein is obtained .
affinity chromatography often utilizes a biomolecule's affinity for a metal ( zn , cu , fe , etc .
) .
columns are often manually prepared .
traditional affinity columns are used as a preparative step to flush out unwanted biomolecules .
however , hplc techniques exist that do utilize affinity chromatography properties .
immobilized metal affinity chromatography ( imac ) is useful to separate aforementioned molecules based on the relative affinity for the metal ( i .
e .
dionex imac ) .
often these columns can be loaded with different metals to create a column with a targeted affinity .
supercritical fluid chromatography is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a fluid above and relatively close to its critical temperature and pressure .
ion exchange chromatography ( usually referred to as ion chromatography ) uses an ion exchange mechanism to separate analytes based on their respective charges .
it is usually performed in columns but can also be useful in planar mode .
ion exchange chromatography uses a charged stationary phase to separate charged compounds including anions , cations , amino acids , peptides , and proteins .
in conventional methods the stationary phase is an ion exchange resin that carries charged functional groups that interact with oppositely charged groups of the compound to retain .
there are two types of ion exchange chromatography : cation-exchange and anion-exchange .
in the cation-exchange chromatography the stationary phase has negative charge and the exchangeable ion is a cation , whereas , in the anion-exchange chromatography the stationary phase has positive charge and the exchangeable ion is an anion .
ion exchange chromatography is commonly used to purify proteins using fplc .
it is one of the most usable form of chromatography .
size-exclusion chromatography ( sec ) is also known as " gel permeation chromatography " ( gpc ) or " gel filtration chromatography " and separates molecules according to their size ( or more accurately according to their hydrodynamic diameter or hydrodynamic volume ) .
smaller molecules are able to enter the pores of the media and , therefore , molecules are trapped and removed from the flow of the mobile phase .
the average residence time in the pores depends upon the effective size of the analyte molecules .
however , molecules that are larger than the average pore size of the packing are excluded and thus suffer essentially no retention ; such species are the first to be eluted .
it is generally a low-resolution chromatography technique and thus it is often reserved for the final , " polishing " step of a purification .
it is also useful for determining the tertiary structure and quaternary structure of purified proteins , especially since it can be carried out under native solution conditions .
an expanded bed chromatographic adsorption ( eba ) column for a biochemical separation process comprises a pressure equalization liquid distributor having a self-cleaning function below a porous blocking sieve plate at the bottom of the expanded bed , an upper part nozzle assembly having a backflush cleaning function at the top of the expanded bed , a better distribution of the feedstock liquor added into the expanded bed ensuring that the fluid passed through the expanded bed layer displays a state of piston flow .
the expanded bed layer displays a state of piston flow .
the expanded bed chromatographic separation column has advantages of increasing the separation efficiency of the expanded bed .
expanded-bed adsorption ( eba ) chromatography is a convenient and effective technique for the capture of proteins directly from unclarified crude sample .
in eba chromatography , the settled bed is first expanded by upward flow of equilibration buffer .
the crude feed , a mixture of soluble proteins , contaminants , cells , and cell debris , is then passed upward through the expanded bed .
target proteins are captured on the adsorbent , while particulates and contaminants pass through .
a change to elution buffer while maintaining upward flow results in desorption of the target protein in expanded-bed mode .
alternatively , if the flow is reversed , the adsorbed particles will quickly settle and the proteins can be desorbed by an elution buffer .
the mode used for elution ( expanded-bed versus settled-bed ) depends on the characteristics of the feed .
after elution , the adsorbent is cleaned with a predefined cleaning-in-place ( cip ) solution , with cleaning followed by either column regeneration ( for further use ) or storage .
reversed-phase chromatography ( rpc ) is any liquid chromatography procedure in which the mobile phase is significantly more polar than the stationary phase .
it is so named because in normal-phase liquid chromatography , the mobile phase is significantly less polar than the stationary phase .
hydrophobic molecules in the mobile phase tend to adsorb to the relatively hydrophobic stationary phase .
hydrophilic molecules in the mobile phase will tend to elute first .
separating columns typically comprise a c8 or c18 carbon-chain bonded to a silica particle substrate .
hydrophobic interactions between proteins and the chromatographic matrix can be exploited to purify proteins .
in hydrophobic interaction chromatography the matrix material is lightly substituted with hydrophobic groups .
these groups can range from methyl , ethyl , propyl , octyl , or phenyl groups .
at high salt concentrations , non-polar sidechains on the surface on proteins " interact " with the hydrophobic groups ; that is , both types of groups are excluded by the polar solvent ( hydrophobic effects are augmented by increased ionic strength ) .
thus , the sample is applied to the column in a buffer which is highly polar .
the eluant is typically an aqueous buffer with decreasing salt concentrations , increasing concentrations of detergent ( which disrupts hydrophobic interactions ) , or changes in ph .
in general , hydrophobic interaction chromatography ( hic ) is advantageous if the sample is sensitive to ph change or harsh solvents typically used in other types of chromatography but not high salt concentrations .
commonly , it is the amount of salt in the buffer which is varied .
in *num* , müller and franzreb described the effects of temperature on hic using bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) with four different types of hydrophobic resin .
the study altered temperature as to effect the binding affinity of bsa onto the matrix .
it was concluded that cycling temperature from *num* degrees to *num* degrees would not be adequate to effectively wash all bsa from the matrix but could be very effective if the column would only be used a few times .
using temperature to effect change allows labs to cut costs on buying salt and saves money .
if high salt concentrations along with temperature fluctuations want to be avoided you can use a more hydrophobic to compete with your sample to elute it .
[ source ] this so-called salt independent method of hic showed a direct isolation of human immunoglobulin g ( igg ) from serum with satisfactory yield and used beta-cyclodextrin as a competitor to displace igg from the matrix .
this largely opens up the possibility of using hic with samples which are salt sensitive as we know high salt concentrations precipitate proteins .
in some cases , the chemistry within a given column can be insufficient to separate some analytes .
it is possible to direct a series of unresolved peaks onto a second column with different physico-chemical ( chemical classification ) properties .
since the mechanism of retention on this new solid support is different from the first dimensional separation , it can be possible to separate compounds by two-dimensional chromatography that are indistinguishable by one-dimensional chromatography .
the sample is spotted at one corner of a square plate , developed , air-dried , then rotated by 90° and usually redeveloped in a second solvent system .
the simulated moving bed ( smb ) technique is a variant of high performance liquid chromatography ; it is used to separate particles and / or chemical compounds that would be difficult or impossible to resolve otherwise .
this increased separation is brought about by a valve-and-column arrangement that is used to lengthen the stationary phase indefinitely .
in the moving bed technique of preparative chromatography the feed entry and the analyte recovery are simultaneous and continuous , but because of practical difficulties with a continuously moving bed , simulated moving bed technique was proposed .
in the simulated moving bed technique instead of moving the bed , the sample inlet and the analyte exit positions are moved continuously , giving the impression of a moving bed .
true moving bed chromatography ( tmbc ) is only a theoretical concept .
its simulation , smbc is achieved by the use of a multiplicity of columns in series and a complex valve arrangement , which provides for sample and solvent feed , and also analyte and waste takeoff at appropriate locations of any column , whereby it allows switching at regular intervals the sample entry in one direction , the solvent entry in the opposite direction , whilst changing the analyte and waste takeoff positions appropriately as well .
pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry is a method of chemical analysis in which the sample is heated to decomposition to produce smaller molecules that are separated by gas chromatography and detected using mass spectrometry .
pyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of materials in an inert atmosphere or a vacuum .
the sample is put into direct contact with a platinum wire , or placed in a quartz sample tube , and rapidly heated to 600–1000 °c .
depending on the application even higher temperatures are used .
three different heating techniques are used in actual pyrolyzers : isothermal furnace , inductive heating ( curie point filament ) , and resistive heating using platinum filaments .
large molecules cleave at their weakest points and produce smaller , more volatile fragments .
these fragments can be separated by gas chromatography .
pyrolysis gc chromatograms are typically complex because a wide range of different decomposition products is formed .
the data can either be used as fingerprint to prove material identity or the gc / ms data is used to identify individual fragments to obtain structural information .
to increase the volatility of polar fragments , various methylating reagents can be added to a sample before pyrolysis .
besides the usage of dedicated pyrolyzers , pyrolysis gc of solid and liquid samples can be performed directly inside programmable temperature vaporizer ( ptv ) injectors that provide quick heating ( up to *num* °c / s ) and high maximum temperatures of 600–650 °c .
this is sufficient for some pyrolysis applications .
the main advantage is that no dedicated instrument has to be purchased and pyrolysis can be performed as part of routine gc analysis .
in this case quartz gc inlet liners have to be used .
quantitative data can be acquired , and good results of derivatization inside the ptv injector are published as well .
fast protein liquid chromatography ( fplc ) , is a form of liquid chromatography that is often used to analyze or purify mixtures of proteins .
as in other forms of chromatography , separation is possible because the different components of a mixture have different affinities for two materials , a moving fluid ( the " mobile phase " ) and a porous solid ( the stationary phase ) .
in fplc the mobile phase is an aqueous solution , or " buffer " .
the buffer flow rate is controlled by a positive-displacement pump and is normally kept constant , while the composition of the buffer can be varied by drawing fluids in different proportions from two or more external reservoirs .
the stationary phase is a resin composed of beads , usually of cross-linked agarose , packed into a cylindrical glass or plastic column .
fplc resins are available in a wide range of bead sizes and surface ligands depending on the application .
countercurrent chromatography ( ccc ) is a type of liquid-liquid chromatography , where both the stationary and mobile phases are liquids .
the operating principle of ccc equipment requires a column consisting of an open tube coiled around a bobbin .
the bobbin is rotated in a double-axis gyratory motion ( a cardioid ) , which causes a variable gravity ( g ) field to act on the column during each rotation .
this motion causes the column to see one partitioning step per revolution and components of the sample separate in the column due to their partitioning coefficient between the two immiscible liquid phases used .
there are many types of ccc available today .
these include hsccc ( high speed ccc ) and hpccc ( high performance ccc ) .
hpccc is the latest and best performing version of the instrumentation available currently .
in contrast to countercurrent chromatography ( see above ) , periodic counter-current chromatography ( pcc ) uses a solid stationary phase and only a liquid mobile phase .
it thus is much more similar to conventional affinity chromatography than to countercurrent chromatography .
pcc uses multiple columns , which during the loading phase are connected in line .
this mode allows for overloading the first column in this series without losing product , which already breaks through the column before the resin is fully saturated .
the breakthrough product is captured on the subsequent column ( s ) .
in a next step the columns are disconnected from one another .
the first column is washed and eluted , while the other column ( s ) are still being loaded .
once the ( initially ) first column is re-equilibrated , it is re-introduced to the loading stream , but as last column .
the process then continues in a cyclic fashion .
chiral chromatography involves the separation of stereoisomers .
in the case of enantiomers , these have no chemical or physical differences apart from being three-dimensional mirror images .
conventional chromatography or other separation processes are incapable of separating them .
to enable chiral separations to take place , either the mobile phase or the stationary phase must themselves be made chiral , giving differing affinities between the analytes .
chiral chromatography hplc columns ( with a chiral stationary phase ) in both normal and reversed phase are commercially available .
aqueous normal-phase ( anp ) chromatography is characterized by the elution behavior of classical normal phase mode ( i .
e .
where the mobile phase is significantly less polar than the stationary phase ) in which water is one of the mobile phase solvent system components .
it is distinguished from hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography ( hilic ) in that the retention mechanism is due to adsorption rather than partitioning .
eusebius amort eusebius amort ( november *num* , *num* – february *num* , *num* ) was a german roman catholic theologian .
amort was born at bibermuhle , near tolz , in upper bavaria .
he studied at munich , and at an early age joined the canons regular at polling , where , shortly after his ordination in *num* , he taught theology and philosophy .
the parnassus boicus learned society was based on a plan started in *num* by three augustinian fathers : eusebius amort , gelasius hieber ( 1671-1731 ) , a famous preacher in the german language and agnellus kandler ( 1692-1745 ) , a genealogist and librarian .
the initial plans fell through , but in *num* they issued the first volume of the " parnassus boicus " journal , communicating interesting information from the arts and sciences .
in *num* amort went to rome as theologian to cardinal niccolo maria lercari ( d .
*num* ) .
he returned to polling in *num* and devoted the rest of his life to the revival of learning in bavaria .
he died at polling in *num* .
amort , who had the reputation of being the most learned man of his age , was a voluminous writer on every conceivable subject , from poetry to astronomy , from dogmatic theology to mysticism .
his best known works are : the list of his other works , including his three erudite contributions to the question of authorship of the " imitatio christi " , will be found in c .
toussaint's scholarly article in alfred vacant's " dictionnaire de theologie " ( *num* , cols 1115-1117 ) .
barrister a barrister is a type of lawyer in common law jurisdictions .
barristers mostly specialise in courtroom advocacy and litigation .
their tasks include taking cases in superior courts and tribunals , drafting legal pleadings , researching the philosophy , hypothesis and history of law , and giving expert legal opinions .
often , barristers are also recognised as " legal scholars " .
barristers are distinguished from solicitors , who have more direct access to clients , and may do transactional-type legal work .
it is mainly barristers who are appointed as judges , and they are rarely hired by clients directly .
in some legal systems , including those of scotland , south africa , scandinavia , pakistan , india , bangladesh , and the british crown dependencies of jersey , guernsey and the isle of man , the word barrister is also regarded as an honorific title .
in a few jurisdictions , barristers are usually forbidden from " conducting " litigation , and can only act on the instructions of a solicitor , who performs tasks such as corresponding with parties and the court , and drafting court documents .
in england and wales , barristers may seek authorisation from the bar standards board to conduct litigation .
this allows a barrister to practise in a ' dual capacity ' , fulfilling the role of both barrister and solicitor .
in some countries with common law legal systems , such as new zealand and some regions of australia , lawyers are entitled to practise both as barristers and solicitors , but it remains a separate system of qualification to practise exclusively as a barrister .
a barrister , who can be considered as a jurist , is a lawyer who represents a litigant as advocate before a court of appropriate jurisdiction .
a barrister speaks in court and presents the case before a judge or jury .
in some jurisdictions , a barrister receives additional training in evidence law , ethics , and court practice and procedure .
in contrast , a solicitor generally meets with clients , does preparatory and administrative work and provides legal advice .
in this role , he or she may draft and review legal documents , interact with the client as necessary , prepare evidence , and generally manage the day-to-day administration of a lawsuit .
a solicitor can provide a crucial support role to a barrister when in court , such as managing large volumes of documents in the case or even negotiating a settlement outside the courtroom while the trial continues inside .
there are other essential differences .
a barrister will usually have rights of audience in the higher courts , whereas other legal professionals will often have more limited access , or will need to acquire additional qualifications to have such access .
as in common law countries in which there is a split between the roles of barrister and solicitor , the barrister in civil law jurisdictions is responsible for appearing in trials or pleading cases before the courts .
barristers usually have particular knowledge of case law , precedent , and the skills to " build " a case .
when a solicitor in general practice is confronted with an unusual point of law , they may seek the " opinion of counsel " on the issue .
in most countries , barristers operate as sole practitioners , and are prohibited from forming partnerships or from working as a barrister as part of a corporation .
( in *num* , the clementi report recommended the abolition of this restriction in england and wales .
) however , barristers normally band together into " chambers " to share clerks ( administrators ) and operating expenses .
some chambers grow to be large and sophisticated , and have a distinctly corporate feel .
in some jurisdictions , they may be employed by firms of solicitors , banks , or corporations as in-house legal advisers .
in contrast , solicitors and attorneys work directly with the clients and are responsible for engaging a barrister with the appropriate expertise for the case .
barristers generally have little or no direct contact with their ' lay clients ' , particularly without the presence or involvement of the solicitor .
all correspondence , inquiries , invoices , and so on , will be addressed to the solicitor , who is primarily responsible for the barrister's fees .
in court , barristers are often visibly distinguished from solicitors by their apparel .
for example , in ireland , england , and wales , a barrister usually wears a horsehair wig , stiff collar , bands , and a gown .
since january *num* , solicitor advocates have also been entitled to wear wigs , but wear different gowns .
in many countries the traditional divisions between barristers and solicitors are breaking down .
barristers once enjoyed a monopoly on appearances before the higher courts , but in great britain this has now been abolished , and solicitor advocates can generally appear for clients at trial .
increasingly , firms of solicitors are keeping even the most advanced advisory and litigation work in-house for economic and client relationship reasons .
similarly , the prohibition on barristers taking instructions directly from the public has also been widely abolished .
but , in practice , direct instruction is still a rarity in most jurisdictions , partly because barristers with narrow specializations , or who are only really trained for advocacy , are not prepared to provide general advice to members of the public .
historically , barristers have had a major role in trial preparation , including drafting pleadings and reviewing evidence .
in some areas of law , that is still the case .
in other areas , it is relatively common for the barrister to receive the brief from the instructing solicitor to represent a client at trial only a day or two before the proceeding .
part of the reason for this is cost .
a barrister is entitled to a ' brief fee ' when a brief is delivered , and this represents the bulk of her / his fee in relation to any trial .
they are then usually entitled to a ' refresher ' for each day of the trial after the first .
but if a case is settled before the trial , the barrister is not needed and the brief fee would be wasted .
some solicitors avoid this by delaying delivery of the brief until it is certain the case will go to trial .
some benefits of maintaining the split include : some disadvantages of the split include : a detailed examination of the justifications for a split legal profession and of the arguments in favour of a fused profession can be found in english solicitor peter reeve’s *num* book , " are two legal professions necessary ? " barristers are regulated by the bar for the jurisdiction where they practise , and in some countries , by the inn of court to which they belong .
in some countries , there is external regulation .
inns of court , where they exist , regulate admission to the profession .
inns of court are independent societies that are titularly responsible for the training , admission ( calling ) , and discipline of barristers .
where they exist , a person may only be called to the bar by an inn , of which they must first be a member .
in fact , historically , call to and success at the bar , to a large degree , depended upon social connections made early in life .
a bar collectively describes all members of the profession of barrister within a given jurisdiction .
while as a minimum the bar is an association embracing all its members , it is usually the case , either " de facto " or " de jure " , that the bar is invested with regulatory powers over the manner in which barristers practise .
in the common law tradition , the respective roles of a lawyer – that is as legal adviser and advocate – were formally split into two separate , regulated sub-professions , the other being the office of solicitor .
historically , the distinction was absolute , but in the modern legal age , some countries that had a split legal profession now have a fused profession – anyone entitled to practise as a barrister may also practise as a solicitor , and vice versa .
in practice , the distinction may be non-existent , minor , or marked , depending on the jurisdiction .
in some jurisdictions , such australia , scotland and ireland , there is little overlap .
in the australian states of new south wales , victoria and queensland , there is a split profession .
nevertheless , subject to conditions , barristers can accept direct access work from clients .
each state bar association regulates the profession and essentially has the functions of the english inns of court .
in the states of south australia and western australia , as well as the australian capital territory , the professions of barrister and solicitor are fused , but an independent bar nonetheless exists , regulated by the legal practice board of the state or territory .
in tasmania and the northern territory , the profession is fused , although a very small number of practitioners operate as an independent bar .
generally counsel dress in the traditional english manner ( wig , gown , and jabot ) before superior courts , although this is not usually done for interlocutory applications .
wigs and robes are still worn in the supreme court and the district court in civil matters and is dependent on the judicial officer's attire .
robes and wigs are worn in all criminal cases .
in western australia , wigs are no longer worn in any court .
each year , the bar association appoints certain barristers of seniority and eminence to the rank of " senior counsel " ( in most states and territories ) or " queen's counsel " ( in the northern territory , queensland , and victoria ) .
such barristers carry the title " sc " or " qc " after their name .
the appointments are made after a process of consultation with members of the profession and the judiciary .
senior counsel appear in particularly complex or difficult cases .
they make up about *num* per cent of the bar in new south wales .
in bangladesh , the law relating to the barristers is the bangladesh legal practitioners and bar council order , *num* ( president order no .
*num* ) as amended which is administered and enforced by the bangladesh bar council .
bangladesh bar council is the supreme statutory body to regulate the legal professions in bangladesh and ensure educational standard and regulatory compliance by the advocates on roll of the bar council .
the bar council , with the help of government , prescribes rules to regulate the profession .
all law graduates educating from home or abroad have to write and pass the bar council examination to be enrolled and admitted as professional advocates to practice law both as barristers & solicitors .
the newly enrolled advocates are permitted to start practice in the lower ( district ) courts after admitting as members of the local ( district ) bar associations .
after two years of practice in lower court the advocates are eligible to be enrolled in the high court division of the supreme court of bangladesh .
by passing the bar council examination , the advocates are issued with certificates of enrollment and permission in prescribed form to practise in the high court division of the supreme court also .
only those advocates who became barristers in u .
k .
maintain their honorific title of barristers .
in bangladesh there is an association called barristers ' association of bangladesh that represents the such u .
k .
bases barristers .
[ *num* ] in canada ( except quebec ) , the professions of barrister and solicitor are fused , and many lawyers refer to themselves with both names , even if they do not practise in both areas .
in colloquial parlance within the canadian legal profession , lawyers often term themselves as " litigators " ( or " barristers " ) , or as " solicitors " , depending on the nature of their law practice though some may in effect practise as both litigators and solicitors .
however , " litigators " would generally perform all litigation functions traditionally performed by barristers and solicitors ; in contrast , those terming themselves " solicitors " would generally limit themselves to legal work not involving practice before the courts ( not even in a preparatory manner as performed by solicitors in england ) , though some might practise before chambers judges .
as is the practice in many other commonwealth jurisdictions such as australia , canadian litigators are " gowned " , but without a wig , when appearing before courts of " superior jurisdiction " .
all law graduates from canadian law schools , and nca certificates of qualification ( internationally trained lawyers ) from the federation of law society of canada after having completed more than a year article-ship in law firms write the bar and solicitor examinations as prescribed by their professional regulating body , the law societies ( e .
g .
law society of upper canada ) .
the passed candidates are called to the degree of barrister-at-law and issued with certificate of barristers and solicitors and admit to practice in her majesty's bar within the control of the society .
the situation is somewhat different in quebec as a result of its civil law tradition .
the profession of solicitor , or " avoué " , never took hold in colonial quebec , so attorneys ( " avocats " ) have traditionally been a fused profession , arguing and preparing cases in contentious matters , whereas quebec's other type of lawyer , civil-law notaries ( " notaires " ) , handle out-of-court non-contentious matters .
however , a number of areas of non-contentious private law are not monopolized by notaries so that attorneys often specialise in handling either trials , cases , advising , or non-trial matters .
the only disadvantage is that attorneys cannot draw up public instruments that have the same force of law as notarial acts .
most large law firms in quebec offer the full range of legal services of law firms in common-law provinces .
intending quebec attorneys must earn a bachelor's degree in civil law , pass the provincial bar examination , and successfully complete a legal internship to be admitted to practice .
attorneys are regulated by the quebec law society ( " barreau du québec " ) .
in france , " avocats " , or attorneys , were , until the *ord* century , the equivalent of barristers .
the profession included several grades ranked by seniority : " avocat-stagiaire " ( trainee , who was already qualified but needed to complete two years ( or more , depending on the period ) of training alongside seasoned lawyers ) , " avocat " , and " avocat honoraire " ( senior barrister ) .
since the *ord* century and during the course of the *ord* and *ord* in particular , french barristers competed in territorial battles over respective areas of legal practice against the " conseil juridique " ( legal advisor , transactional solicitor ) and " avoué " ( procedural solicitor ) , and expanded to become the generalist legal practitioner , with the notable exception of " notaires " ( notaries ) , who are ministry appointed lawyers ( with a separate qualification ) and who retain exclusivity over conveyancing and probate .
after the *num* and *num* legal reforms , the " avocat " was fused with the " avoué " and the " conseil juridique " , making the " avocat " ( or , if female , " avocate " ) an all-purpose lawyer for matters of contentious jurisdiction , analogous to an american attorney .
french attorneys usually do not ( although it they are entitled to ) act both as litigators ( trial lawyers ) and legal consultants ( advising lawyers ) , known respectively as " avocat plaidant " and " avocat-conseil " .
this distinction is however purely informal and does not correspond to any difference in qualification or admission to the roll .
all intending attorneys must pass an examination to be able to enrol in one of the " centre régional de formation à la profession d'avocat ( crfpa ) " ( regional centre for the training of lawyers ) .
the " crfpa " course has a duration of two years and is a mix between classroom teachings and internships .
its culmination is the " stage final " ( final training ) , where the intending attorney spends *num* months in a law firm ( generally in his / her favoured field of practice and in a firm in which he / she hopes to be recruited afterwards ) .
the intending attorney then needs to pass the " certificat d'aptitude à la profession d'avocat ( capa ) " , which is the last professional examination allowing him / her to join a court's bar ( " barreau " ) .
it is generally recognised that the first examination is much more difficult than the capa and is dreaded by most law students .
each bar is regulated by a bar council ( " ordre du barreau " ) .
in germany , no distinction is made and lawyers may plead at all courts with the exception of the civil branch of the federal court of justice ( " bundesgerichtshof " ) to which fewer than fifty lawyers are admitted as of *num* august *num* .
see the " list of lawyers admitted to the bundesgerichtshof " .
those lawyers may not plead at other courts , almost only deal with litigation , and are usually instructed by a lawyer who represented the client in the lower courts .
however , these restrictions do not apply to criminal cases , nor to pleadings at courts of the other court systems ( labour , administrative , taxation , and social courts , as well as the eu court system ) .
the legal profession in hong kong is also divided into two branches : barristers and solicitors .
in the high court and the court of final appeal , as a general rule , only barristers and solicitor-advocates are allowed to speak on behalf of any party in open court .
this means that solicitors are restricted from doing so .
in these two courts , barristers dress in the traditional english manner , as do the judges and other lawyers .
in hong kong , the rank of queen's counsel was granted prior to the transfer of the sovereignty of hong kong from the united kingdom to china in *num* .
after the handover , the rank has been replaced by senior counsel post-nominal letters : sc .
senior counsel may still , however , style themselves as silks , like their british counterparts .
in india , the law relating to the barrister is the advocates act , *num* introduced and thought up by ashoke kumar sen , the then law minister of india , which is a law passed by the parliament and is administered and enforced by the bar council of india .
under the act , the bar council of india is the supreme regulatory body to regulate the legal profession in india and also to ensure the compliance of the laws and maintenance of professional standards by the legal profession in the country .
for this purpose , the bar council of india is authorized to pass regulations and make orders in individual cases and also generally .
each state has a bar council of its own whose function is to enroll the barristers willing to practise predominately within the territorial confines of that state and to perform the functions of the bar council of india within the territory assigned to them .
therefore , each law degree holder must be enrolled with a ( single ) state bar council to practise in india .
however , enrollment with any state bar council does not restrict the barrister from appearing before any court in india , even though it is beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the state bar council which he is enrolled in .
the advantage with having the state bar councils is that the work load of the bar council of india can be divided into these various state bar councils and also that matters can be dealt with locally and in an expedited manner .
however , for all practical and legal purposes , the bar council of india retains with it , the final power to take decisions in any and all matters related to the legal profession on the whole or with respect to any the process for being entitled to practise in india is twofold .
first , the applicant must be a holder of a law degree from a recognized institution in india ( or from one of the four recognised universities in the united kingdom ) and second , must pass the enrollment qualifications of the bar council of the state where he / she seeks to be enrolled .
for this purpose , the bar council of india has an internal committee whose function is to supervise and examine the various institutions conferring law degrees and to grant recognition to these institutions once they meet the required standards .
in this manner the bar council of india also ensures the standard of education required for practising in india are met with .
as regards the qualification for enrollment with the state bar council , while the actual formalities may vary from one state to another , yet predominately they ensure that the application has not been a bankrupt / criminal and is generally fit to practise before courts of india .
enrollment with a bar council also means that the law degree holder is recognized as a barrister and is required to maintain a standards of conduct and professional demeanor at all times , both on and off the profession .
the bar council of india also prescribes " rules of conduct " to be observed by the barristers in the courts , while interacting with clients and even otherwise .
in the republic of ireland , admission to the bar by the chief justice of ireland is restricted to those on whom a barrister-at-law degree ( b .
l .
) has first been conferred .
the honorable society of king's inns is the only educational establishment which runs vocational courses for barristers in the republic and degrees of barrister-at-law can only be conferred by king's inns .
king's inns are also the only body with the capacity to call individuals to the bar and to disbar them .
most irish barristers choose to be governed thereafter by the bar council of ireland , a quasi-private entity .
senior members of the profession may be selected for elevation to the inner bar , when they may describe themselves as senior counsel ( " s .
c .
" ) .
admission to the inner bar is made by declaration before the supreme court , patents of precedence having been granted by the government .
irish barristers are sole practitioners and may not form chambers or partnerships if they wish to remain members of the bar council's law library .
to practise under the bar council of ireland's rules , a newly qualified barrister is apprenticed to an experienced barrister of at least seven years ' experience .
this apprenticeship is known as pupillage or devilling .
devilling is compulsory for those barristers who wish to be members of the law library and lasts for one legal year .
it is common to devil for a second year in a less formal arrangement but this is not compulsory .
in israel there is no distinction between barristers and solicitors , even though the judicial system is based mostly on english common law , as a continuation of the british mandate in palestine .
japan adopts a unified system .
however , there are certain classes of qualified professionals who are allowed to practise in certain limited areas of law , such as scriveners ( " "shiho shoshi" " , qualified to handle title registration , deposit , and certain petite court proceedings with additional certification ) , tax accountants ( " "zeirishi" " , qualified to prepare tax returns , provide advice on tax computation and represent a client in administrative tax appeals ) and patent agents ( " "benrishi" " , qualified to practise patent registration and represent a client in administrative patent appeals ) .
only the lawyers ( " "bengoshi" " ) can appear before court and are qualified to practise in any areas of law , including , but not limited to , areas that those qualified law-related professionals above are allowed to practise .
most attorneys still focus primarily on court practice and still a very small number of attorneys give sophisticated and expertised legal advice on a day-to-day basis to large corporations .
the netherlands used to have a semi-separated legal profession comprising the lawyer and the " procureur " , the latter resembling , to some extent , the profession of barrister .
under that system , lawyers were entitled to represent their clients in law , but were only able to file cases before the court at which they were registered .
cases falling under the jurisdiction of another court had to be filed by a " procureur " registered at that court , in practice often another lawyer exercising both functions .
questions were raised on the necessity of the separation , given the fact that its main purpose – the preservation of the quality of the legal profession and observance of local court rules and customs – had become obsolete .
for that reason , the " procureur " as a separate profession was abolished and its functions merged with the legal profession in *num* .
currently , lawyers can file cases before any court , regardless of where they are registered .
the only notable exception concerns cases brought before the supreme court , which have to be handled by lawyers registered in the district of south holland , mainly for qualitative reasons .
in new zealand , the professions are not formally fused but practitioners are enrolled in the high court as " barristers and solicitors " .
they may choose , however , to practise as barristers sole .
about *num* % practise solely as barristers , mainly in the larger cities and usually in " chambers " ( following the british terminology ) .
they receive " instructions " from other practitioners , at least nominally .
they usually conduct the proceedings in their entirety .
any lawyer may apply to become a queen's counsel ( qc ) to recognize long standing contribution to the legal profession but this status is only conferred on those practising as solicitors in exceptional circumstances .
this step , referred to as " being called to the inner bar " or " taking silk " , is considered highly prestigious and has been a step in the career of many new zealand judges .
unlike other jurisdictions , the term " junior barrister " is popularly used to refer to a lawyer who holds a practising certificate as a barrister , but is employed by another , more senior barrister .
generally , junior barristers are within their first five years of practise and are not yet qualified to practise as barristers sole .
barristers sole ( i .
e .
barristers who are not employed by another barrister ) who are not queen's counsel are never referred to as junior barristers .
in nigeria , there is no formal distinction between barristers and solicitors .
all students who pass the bar examinations – offered exclusively by the nigerian law school – are called to the nigerian bar , by the body of benchers .
lawyers may argue in any federal trial or appellate court as well as any of the courts in nigeria's *num* states and the federal capital territory .
the legal practitioner's act , refers to nigerian lawyers as legal practitioners , and following their call to the bar , nigerian lawyers enter their names in the register or roll of legal practitioners kept at the supreme court .
perhaps for this reason , a nigerian lawyer is also often referred to as a barrister and solicitor of the supreme court of nigeria , and many nigerian lawyers term themselves barrister-at-law complete with the postnominal initials " b .
l .
" .
the vast majority of nigerian lawyers combine contentious and non-contentious work , although there is a growing tendency for practitioners in the bigger practices to specialise in one or the other .
in colloquial parlance within the nigerian legal profession , lawyers may for this reason be referred to as " litigators " or as " solicitors " .
consistent with the practice in england and elsewhere in the commonwealth , senior members of the profession may be selected for elevation to the inner bar by conferment of the rank of senior advocate of nigeria ( san ) .
in pakistan to practice as a barrister , law graduates have to complete three steps .
they have to pass the bar practice and training course ( bptc ) , be called to the bar by an inn of court from england and wales and attain a licence to practice as an advocate in the courts of pakistan from the relevant bar council , provincial or federal .
in poland , there are two main types of legal professions : advocate and legal counsel .
both are regulated and these professions are restricted only for people who graduated five-year law studies , have at least three years of experience and passed five difficult national exams ( civil law , criminal law , company law , administrative law and ethic ) or have a doctor of law degree .
before *num* , the only difference was that advocates have a right to represent clients before the court in all cases and the legal advisors could not represent clients before the court in criminal cases .
presently , the legal advisors can also represent clients in criminal cases so currently , the differences between this professions are only historical significance .
in south africa the employment and practise of advocates ( as barristers are known in south africa ) is consistent with the rest of the commonwealth .
advocates carry the rank of junior or senior counsel ( sc ) , and are mostly briefed and paid by solicitors ( known as attorneys ) .
they are usually employed in the higher courts , particularly in the appeal courts where they often appear as specialist counsel .
south african solicitors ( attorneys ) follow a practice of referring cases to counsel for an opinion before proceeding with a case , when counsel in question practises as a specialist in the case law at stake .
aspiring advocates currently spend one year in pupillage ( formerly only six months ) before being admitted to the bar in their respective provincial or judicial jurisdictions .
the term ' advocate ' is sometimes used in south africa as a title , e .
g .
' advocate john doe , sc ' ( ' advokaat ' in afrikaans ) in the same fashion as ' dr .
john doe ' for a medical doctor .
in south korea , there is no distinction between the judiciary and lawyers .
previously , a person who has passed the national bar exam after two years of national education is able to become a judge , prosecutor , or " lawyer " in accordance to their grades upon graduation .
as a result of changes from implementing an accommodated law school system , there are two standard means of becoming a lawyer .
under the current legal system , to be a judge or a prosecutor , lawyers need to practise their legal knowledge .
a " lawyer " does not have any limitation of practice .
spain has a division but it does not correspond to the division in britain between barristers / advocates and solicitors .
" procuradores " represent the litigant procedurally in court , generally under the authority of a power of attorney executed by a civil law notary , while " abogados " represent the substantive claims of the litigant through trial advocacy .
" abogados " perform both transactional work and advise in connection with court proceedings , and they have full right of audience in front of the court .
the court proceeding is carried out with " abogados " , not with procuradores .
in a nutshell , procuradores are court agents that operate under the instructions of an " abogado " .
their practice is confined to the locality of the court to which they are admitted .
although with somewhat different laws , england and wales are considered within the united kingdom a single united and unified legal jurisdiction for the purposes of both civil and criminal law , alongside scotland and northern ireland , the other two legal jurisdictions within the united kingdom .
england and wales are covered by a common bar ( an organisation of barristers ) and a single law society ( an organisation of solicitors ) .
the profession of barrister in england and wales is a separate profession from that of solicitor .
it is , however , possible to hold the qualification of both barrister and solicitor at the same time .
it is not necessary to leave the bar to qualify as a solicitor .
barristers are regulated by the bar standards board , a division of the general council of the bar .
a barrister must be a member of one of the inns of court , which traditionally educated and regulated barristers .
there are four inns of court : the honourable society of lincoln's inn , the honourable society of gray's inn , the honourable society of the middle temple , and the honourable society of the inner temple .
all are situated in central london , near the royal courts of justice .
they perform scholastic and social roles , and in all cases , provide financial aid to student barristers ( subject to merit ) through scholarships .
it is the inns that actually " call " the student to the bar at a ceremony similar to a graduation .
social functions include dining with other members and guests and hosting other events .
law graduates wishing to work and be known as barristers must take the bar professional training course ( bptc – previously bar vocational course or bvc ) at one of the institutions authorised by the bar council to offer the bptc .
on successful completion of the bptc student barristers are " called " to the bar by their respective inns and are elevated to the degree of " barrister " .
however , before they can practise independently they must first undertake *num* months of pupillage .
the first six months of this period is spent shadowing more senior practitioners , after which pupil barristers may begin to undertake some court work of their own .
following successful completion of this stage , most barristers then join a set of chambers , a group of counsel who share the costs of premises and support staff whilst remaining individually self-employed .
in december *num* there were just over *num* , *num* barristers in independent practice , of whom about ten percent are queen's counsel and the remainder are junior barristers .
many barristers ( about *num* , *num* ) are employed in companies as ' in-house ' counsel , or by local or national government or in academic institutions .
certain barristers in england and wales are now instructed directly by members of the public .
members of the public may engage the services of the barrister directly within the framework of the public access scheme ; a solicitor is not involved at any stage .
barristers undertaking public access work can provide legal advice and representation in court in almost all areas of law ( see the public access information on the bar council website ) and are entitled to represent clients in any court or tribunal in england and wales .
once instructions from a client are accepted , it is the barrister ( rather than the solicitor ) who advises and guides the client through the relevant legal procedure or litigation .
before a barrister can undertake public access work , they must have completed a special course .
at present , about one in *num* barristers has so qualified .
there is also a separate scheme called ' licensed access ' , available to certain nominated classes of professional client ; it is not open to the general public .
public access work is experiencing a huge surge at the bar , with barristers taking advantage of the new opportunity for the bar to make profit in the face of legal aid cuts elsewhere in the profession .
the ability of barristers to accept such instructions is a recent development ; it results from a change in the rules set down by the general council of the bar in july *num* .
the public access scheme has been introduced as part of the drive to open up the legal system to the public and to make it easier and cheaper to obtain access to legal advice .
it further reduces the distinction between solicitors and barristers .
the distinction remains however because there are certain aspects of a solicitor's role that a barrister is not able to undertake .
some honorific suffixes to signify notable barristers may be " esquire " .
even though the term " barrister-at-law " is sometimes seen , and was once very common , it has never been formally correct in england and wales .
barrister is the only correct nomenclature .
in april *num* there were *num* barristers in independent practice in northern ireland .
*num* were queen's counsel ( qcs ) , barristers who have earned a high reputation and are appointed by the queen on the recommendation of the lord chancellor as senior advocates and advisers .
those barristers who are not qcs are called junior counsel and are styled " bl " or " barrister-at-law " .
the term " junior " is often misleading since many members of the junior bar are experienced barristers with considerable expertise .
benchers are , and have been for centuries , the governing bodies of the four inns of court in london and king's inns , dublin .
the benchers of the inn of court of northern ireland governed the inn until the enactment of the constitution of the inn in *num* , which provides that the government of the inn is shared between the benchers , the executive council of the inn and members of the inn assembled in general meeting .
the executive council ( through its education committee ) is responsible for considering memorials submitted by applicants for admission as students of the inn and by bar students of the inn for admission to the degree of barrister-at-law and making recommendations to the benchers .
the final decisions on these memorials are taken by the benchers .
the benchers also have the exclusive power of expelling or suspending a bar student and of disbarring a barrister or suspending a barrister from practice .
the executive council is also involved with : education ; fees of students ; calling counsel to the bar , although call to the bar is performed by the lord chief justice of northern ireland on the invitation of the benchers ; administration of the bar library ( to which all practising members of the bar belong ) ; and liaising with corresponding bodies in other countries .
the bar council is responsible for the maintenance of the standards , honour and independence of the bar and , through its professional conduct committee , receives and investigates complaints against members of the bar in their professional capacity .
in scotland , an advocate is , in all respects except name , a barrister , but there are significant differences in professional practice .
in scotland , admission to and the conduct of the profession is regulated by the faculty of advocates ( as opposed to an inn ) .
in the bailiwick of jersey , there are solicitors ( called " ecrivains " ) and advocates ( french " avocat " ) .
in the bailiwicks of jersey and guernsey and on the isle of man , advocates perform the combined functions of both solicitors and barristers .
gibraltar is a british overseas territory boasting a legal profession based on the common law .
the legal profession includes both barristers and solicitors with most barristers also acting as solicitors .
admission and disciplinary matters in gibraltar are dealt with by the bar council of gibraltar and the supreme court of gibraltar .
in order for barristers or solicitors to be admitted as practising lawyers in gibraltar they must comply with the supreme court act *num* as amended by the supreme court amendment act *num* which requires , amongst other things , for all newly admitted lawyers as of *num* july *num* to undertake a year's course in gibraltar law at the university of gibraltar .
solicitors also have right of audience in gibraltar's courts .
the united states does not draw a distinction between lawyers as pleaders ( barristers ) and lawyers as agents ( or solicitors ) .
all lawyers who have passed a bar examination and have been admitted to practice may prosecute or defend in the courts of the state where they are admitted .
historically , a distinction was made , and a separate label for barristers ( called " counselors " , hence the expression " attorney " and " counselor at law " ) existed in certain states , though both professions have long since been fused into the all-purpose attorney .
attorneys specializing in court procedure , combining advocacy and case preparation , are called " trial attorneys " or " litigators " .
additionally , some state appellate courts require attorneys to obtain a separate certificate of admission to plead and practise in the appellate court .
federal courts require specific admission to that court's bar to practise before it .
at the state appellate level and in federal courts , there is generally no separate examination process , although some u .
s .
district courts require an examination on practices and procedures in their specific courts .
unless an examination is required , admission is usually granted as a matter of course to any licensed attorney in the state where the court is located .
some federal courts will grant admission to any attorney licensed in any u .
s .
jurisdiction .
edif edif ( electronic design interchange format ) is a vendor-neutral format based on s-expressions in which to store electronic netlists and schematics .
it was one of the first attempts to establish a neutral data exchange format for the electronic design automation ( eda ) industry .
the goal was to establish a common format from which the proprietary formats of the eda systems could be derived .
when customers needed to transfer data from one system to another , it was necessary to write translators from one format to other .
as the number of formats ( " n " ) multiplied , the translator issue became an " n"-squared problem .
the expectation was that with edif the number of translators could be reduced to the number of involved systems .
representatives of the eda companies daisy systems , mentor graphics , motorola , national semiconductor , tektronix , texas instruments and the university of california , berkeley established the " edif steering committee " in november *num* .
later hilary kahn , a computer science professor at the university of manchester , joined the team and led the development from version edif *num* *num* *num* till the final version *num* *num* *num* .
the general format of edif involves using parentheses to delimit data definitions , and in this way it superficially resembles lisp .
the basic tokens of edif *num* .
*num* .
*num* were keywords ( like " library " , " cell " , " instance " , etc .
) , strings ( delimited with double quotes ) , integer numbers , symbolic constants ( e .
g .
" generic " , " tie " , " ripper " for cell types ) and " identifiers " , which are reference labels formed from a very restricted set of characters .
edif *num* .
*num* .
*num* and *num* .
*num* .
*num* dropped the symbolic constants entirely , using keywords instead .
so , the syntax of edif has a fairly simple foundation .
a typical edif file looks like this : the *num* *num* *num* release of edif was made in *num* .
the first " real " public release of edif was version *num* *num* *num* , which was approved in march *num* as the standard ansi / eia-548-1988 .
it is published in a single volume .
this version has no formal scope statement but what it tries to capture is covered by the defined viewtypes : the industry tested this release for several years , but finally only the netlist view was the one widely used and some eda tools are still supporting it today for edif *num* *num* *num* .
to overcome problems with the main *num* *num* *num* standard several further documents got released : because of some fundamental weaknesses in the *num* *num* *num* release a new not compatible release *num* *num* *num* was released in september *num* , given the designation of eia standard eia-618 .
it later achieved ansi and iso designations .
it is published in *num* volumes .
the main focus of this version were the viewtypes netlist and schematic from *num* *num* *num* .
masklayout , pcblayout and some other views were dropped from this release and shifted for later releases because the work for these views was not fully completed .
edif *num* *num* *num* is available from the international electrotechnical commission as iec 61690-1 edif *num* *num* *num* was released in late august *num* , mainly to add " printed circuit board " extensions ( the original pcblayout view ) to edif *num* *num* *num* .
this more than doubled the size of edif *num* *num* *num* , and is published in html format on cd .
edif *num* *num* *num* is available from the international electrotechnical commission as iec 61690-2 to understand the problems users and vendors encountered with edif *num* *num* *num* , one first has to picture all the elements and dynamics of the electronics industry .
the people who needed this standard were mainly design engineers , who worked for companies whose size ranged from a house garage to multi-billion dollar facilities with thousands of engineers .
these engineers worked mainly from schematics and netlists in the late 1980s , and the big push was to generate the netlists from the schematics automatically .
the first suppliers were electronic design automation vendors ( e .
g .
, daisy , mentor , and valid formed the earliest predominating set ) .
these companies competed vigorously for their shares of this market .
one of the tactics used by these companies to " capture " their customers was their proprietary databases .
each had special features that the others did not .
once a decision was made to use a particular vendor's software to enter a design , the customer was ever after constrained to use no other software .
to move from vendor a's to vendor b's systems usually meant a very expensive re-entry of almost all design data by hand into the new system .
this expense of " migration " was the main factor that locked design engineers into using a single vendor .
but the " customers " had a different desire .
they saw immediately that while vendor a might have a really nice analog simulation environment , vendor b had a much better pcb or silicon layout auto-router .
and they wished that they could pick and choose amongst the different vendors .
edif was mainly supported by the electronics design end-users , and their companies .
the eda vendors were involved also , but their motivation was more along the lines of wanting to not alienate their customers .
most of the eda vendors produced edif *num* *num* *num* translators , but they were definitely more interested in generating high-quality edif readers , and they had absolutely no motivation at all to write any software that generated edif ( an edif writer ) , beyond threats from customers of mass migration to another vendor's software .
the result was rather interesting .
hardly any software vendor wrote edif *num* *num* *num* output that did not have severe violations of syntax or semantics .
the semantics were just loose enough that there might be several ways to describe the same data .
this began to be known as " flavors " of edif .
the vendor companies did not always feel it important to allocate many resources to edif products , even if they sold a large number of them .
there were several stories of active products with virtually no-one to maintain them for years .
user complaints were merely gathered and prioritized .
the harder it became to export customer data to edif , the more the vendors seemed to like it .
those who did write edif translators found they spent a huge amount of time and effort on generating sufficiently powerful , forgiving , artificially intelligent readers , that could handle and piece together the poor-quality code produced by the extant edif *num* *num* *num* writers of the day .
in designing edif *num* *num* *num* , the committees were well aware of the faults of the language , the calumny heaped on edif *num* *num* *num* by the vendors and the frustration of the end users .
so , to tighten the semantics of the language , and provide a more formal description of the standard , the revolutionary approach was taken to provide an information model for edif , in the information modeling language express .
this helped to better document the standard , but was done more as an afterthought , as the syntax crafting was done independently of the model , instead of being generated from the model .
also , even though the standard says that if the syntax and model disagree , the model is the standard , this is not the case in practice .
the bnf description of the syntax is the foundation of the language inasmuch as the software that does the day-to-day work of producing design descriptions is based on a fixed syntax .
the information model also suffered from the fact that it was not ( and is not ) ideally suited to describing edif .
it does not describe such concepts as name spaces very well at all , and the differences between a definition and a reference is not clearly describable either .
also , the constructs in express for describing constraints might be formal , but constraint description is a fairly complicated matter at times .
so , most constraints ended up just being described as comments .
most of the others became elaborate formal descriptions which most readers will never be able to decipher , and therefore may not stand up to automated debugging / compiling , just as a program might look good in review , but a compiler might find some interesting errors , and actually running the program written might find even more interesting errors .
( additionally , analogous express compilers / executors didn't exist when the standard was written , and may not still exist today ! ) the solution to the " flavor " problem of edif *num* *num* *num* was to develop a more specific semantic description in edif *num* *num* *num* ( *num* ) .
indeed , reported results of people generating edif *num* *num* *num* translators was that the writers were now " much " more difficult to get right , due to the great number of semantic restrictions , and the readers are comparatively trivial to develop .
the solution to vendor " conflict of interest " was neutral third-party companies , who could provide edif products based on vendor interfaces .
this separation of the edif products from direct vendor control was critical to providing the end-user community with tools that worked well .
it formed naturally and without comment .
engineering dataxpress was perhaps the first such company in this realm , with electronic tools company seeming to have captured the market in the mid to late 1990s .
another dynamic in this industry is edif itself .
since they have grown to a rather large size , generating readers and writers has become a very expensive proposition .
usually the third-party companies have congregated the necessary specialists and can use this expertise to more efficiently generate the software .
they are also able to leverage code sharing and other techniques an individual vendor could not .
by *num* , almost no major vendor produced its own edif tools , choosing instead to oem third-party tools .
since the release of edif *num* *num* *num* , the entire edif standards organisation has essentially dissolved .
there have been no published meetings of any of the technical subcommittees , the edif experts group , etc .
most of the individuals involved have moved on to other companies or efforts .
the newsletter was abandoned , and the users ' group no longer holds yearly meetings .
edif *num* *num* *num* and *num* *num* *num* are now ansi , iec and european ( en ) standards .
edif version *num* *num* *num* is iec / en 61690-1 , and edif version *num* *num* *num* is iec / en 61690-2 .
double-hulled tanker a double-hulled tanker refers to an oil tanker which has a double hull .
they reduce the likelihood of leaks occurring than in single-hulled tankers , and their ability to prevent or reduce oil spills led to double hulls being standardized for oil tankers and other types of ships including by the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships or marpol convention .
after the exxon valdez oil spill disaster in alaska in *num* , the us government required all new oil tankers built for use between us ports to be equipped with a full double hull .
a number of manufacturers have embraced oil tankers with a double hull because it strengthens the hull of ships , reducing the likelihood of oil disasters in low-impact collisions and groundings over single-hull ships .
they reduce the likelihood of leaks occurring at low speed impacts in port areas when the ship is under pilotage .
research of impact damage of ships has revealed that double-hulled tankers are unlikely to perforate both hulls in a collision , preventing oil from seeping out .
however , for smaller tankers , u shaped tanks might be susceptible to " free flooding " across the double bottom and up to the outside water level each side of the cargo tank .
salvors prefer to salvage doubled-hulled tankers because they permit the use of air pressure to vacuum out the flood water .
in the 1960s , collision proof double hulls for nuclear ships were extensively investigated , due to escalating concerns over nuclear accidents .
the ability of double-hulled tankers to prevent or reduce oil spills led to double hulls being standardized for other types of ships including oil tankers by the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships or marpol convention .
in *num* , marpol was amended , making it " mandatory for tankers of *num* , *num* dwt and more ordered after *num* july *num* to be fitted with double hulls , or an alternative design approved by imo " .
however , in the aftermath of the erika incident of the coast off france in december *num* , members of imo adopted a revised schedule for the phase-out of single-hull tankers , which came into effect on *num* september *num* , with further amendments validated on *num* april *num* .
after the exxon valdez oil spill disaster , when that ship grounded on bligh reef outside the port of valdez , alaska in *num* , the us government required all new oil tankers built for use between us ports to be equipped with a full double hull .
however , the damage to the exxon valdez penetrated sections of the hull ( the slops oil tanks , or slop tanks ) that were protected by a double bottom , or partial double hull .
although double-hulled tankers reduce the likelihood of ships grazing rocks and creating holes in the hull , a double hull does not protect against major , high-energy collisions or groundings which cause the majority of oil pollution , despite this being the reason that the double hull was mandated by united states legislation .
double-hulled tankers , if poorly designed , constructed , maintained and operated can be as problematic , if not more problematic than their single-hulled counterparts .
double-hulled tankers have a more complex design and structure than their single-hulled counterparts , which means that they require more maintenance and care in operating , which if not subject to responsible monitoring and policing , may cause problems .
double hulls often result in the weight of the hull increasing by at least *num* % , and because the steel weight of doubled-hulled tanks should not be greater than that of single-hulled ships , the individual hull walls are typically thinner and theoretically less resistant to wear .
double hulls by no means eliminate the possibility of the hulls breaking apart .
due to the air space between the hulls , there is also a potential problem with volatile gases seeping out through worn areas of the internal hull , increasing the risk of an explosion .
although several international conventions against pollution are in place , as of *num* there was still no formal body setting international mandatory standards , although the international safety guide for oil tankers and terminals ( isgott ) does provide guidelines giving advice on optimum use and safety , such as recommending that ballast tanks are not entered while loaded with cargo , and that weekly samples are made of the atmosphere inside for hydrocarbon gas .
due to the difficulties of maintenance , ship builders have been competitive in producing double-hulled ships which are easier to inspect , such as ballast and cargo tanks which are easily accessible and easier to spot corrosion in the hull .
the tanker structure cooperative forum ( tscf ) published the " guide to inspection and maintenance of double-hull tanker structures " in *num* giving advice based on experience of operating double-hulled tankers .
a doll's house a doll's house ( ; also translated as " a doll house " ) is a three-act play written by norway's henrik ibsen .
it premiered at the royal theatre in copenhagen , denmark , on *num* december *num* , having been published earlier that month .
the play is set in a norwegian town circa *num* .
the play is significant for the way it deals with the fate of a married woman , who at the time in norway lacked reasonable opportunities for self-fulfillment in a male-dominated world .
it aroused a great sensation at the time , and caused a “storm of outraged controversy” that went beyond the theatre to the world newspapers and society .
in *num* , the centennial of ibsen's death , " a doll's house " held the distinction of being the world's most performed play that year .
unesco has inscribed ibsen's autographed manuscripts of " a doll's house " on the memory of the world register in *num* , in recognition of their historical value .
the title of the play is most commonly translated as " a doll's house " , though some scholars use " a doll house " .
john simon says that " a doll’s house " is " the british term for what [ americans ] call a ' dollhouse' " .
egil törnqvist says of the alternative title : " rather than being superior to the traditional rendering , it simply sounds more idiomatic to americans .
" the play opens at christmas time as nora helmer enters her home carrying many packages .
nora's husband torvald is working in his study when she arrives .
he playfully rebukes her for spending so much money on christmas gifts , calling her his " little squirrel .
" he teases her about how the previous year she had spent weeks making gifts and ornaments by hand because money was scarce .
this year torvald is due a promotion at the bank where he works , so nora feels that they can let themselves go a little .
the maid announces two visitors : mrs .
kristine linde , an old friend of nora's , who has come seeking employment ; and dr .
rank , a close friend of the family , who is let into the study .
kristine has had a difficult few years , ever since her husband died leaving her with no money or children .
nora says that things have not been easy for them either : torvald became sick , and they had to travel to italy so he could recover .
kristine explains that when her mother was ill she had to take care of her brothers , but now that they are grown she feels her life is " unspeakably empty .
" nora promises to talk to torvald about finding her a job .
kristine gently tells nora that she is like a child .
nora is offended , so she teases the idea that she got money from " some admirer , " so they could travel to italy to improve torvald's health .
she told torvald that her father gave her the money , but in fact she managed to illegally borrow it without his knowledge because women couldn't do anything economical like signing checks without their husband .
over the years , she has been secretly working and saving up to pay it off .
krogstad , a lower-level employee at torvald's bank , arrives and goes into the study .
nora is clearly uneasy when she sees him .
dr .
rank leaves the study and mentions that he feels wretched , though like everyone he wants to go on living .
in contrast to his physical illness , he says that the man in the study , krogstad , is " morally diseased .
" after the meeting with krogstad , torvald comes out of the study .
nora asks him if he can give kristine a position at the bank and torvald is very positive , saying that this is a fortunate moment , as a position has just become available .
torvald , kristine , and dr .
rank leave the house , leaving nora alone .
the nanny returns with the children and nora plays with them for a while until krogstad creeps through the ajar door , into the living room , and surprises her .
krogstad tells nora that torvald intends to fire him at the bank and asks her to intercede with torvald to allow him to keep his job .
she refuses , and krogstad threatens to blackmail her about the loan she took out for the trip to italy ; he knows that she obtained this loan by forging her father's signature .
krogstad leaves and when torvald returns , nora tries to convince him not to fire krogstad .
torvald refuses to hear her pleas , explaining that krogstad is a liar and a hypocrite and that he committed a terrible crime : he forged someone's name .
torvald feels physically ill in the presence of a man " poisoning his own children with lies and dissimulation .
" kristine arrives to help nora repair a dress for a costume function that she and torvald plan to attend the next day .
torvald returns from the bank , and nora pleads with him to reinstate krogstad , claiming she is worried krogstad will publish libelous articles about torvald and ruin his career .
torvald dismisses her fears and explains that , although krogstad is a good worker and seems to have turned his life around , he must be fired because he is too familial around torvald in front of other bank personnel .
torvald then retires to his study to work .
dr .
rank , the family friend , arrives .
nora asks him for a favor , but rank responds by revealing that he has entered the terminal stage of tuberculosis of the spine and that he has always been secretly in love with her .
nora tries to deny the first revelation and make light of it but is more disturbed by his declaration of love .
she then clumsily attempts to tell him that she is not in love with him , but that she loves him dearly as a friend .
desperate after being fired by torvald , krogstad arrives at the house .
nora convinces dr .
rank to go into torvald's study so he will not see krogstad .
when krogstad confronts nora , he declares that he no longer cares about the remaining balance of nora's loan , but that he will instead preserve the associated bond to blackmail torvald into not only keeping him employed but also promoting him .
nora explains that she has done her best to persuade her husband , but he refuses to change his mind .
krogstad informs nora that he has written a letter detailing her crime ( forging her father's signature of surety on the bond ) and put it in torvald's mailbox , which is locked .
nora tells kristine of her difficult situation .
she gives her krogstad's card with his address , and asks her to try to convince him to relent .
torvald enters and tries to retrieve his mail , but nora distracts him by begging him to help her with the dance she has been rehearsing for the costume party , feigning anxiety about performing .
she dances so badly and acts so childishly that torvald agrees to spend the whole evening coaching her .
when the others go to dinner , nora stays behind for a few minutes and contemplates killing herself to save her husband from the shame of the revelation of her crime and to pre-empt any gallant gesture on his part to save her reputation .
kristine tells krogstad that she only married her husband because she had no other means to support her sick mother and young siblings and that she has returned to offer him her love again .
she believes that he would not have stooped to unethical behavior if he had not been devastated by her abandonment and been in dire financial straits .
krogstad changes his mind and offers to take back his letter to torvald .
however , kristine decides that torvald should know the truth for the sake of his and nora's marriage .
after literally dragging nora home from the party , torvald goes to check his mail but is interrupted by dr .
rank , who has followed them .
dr .
rank chats for a while , conveying obliquely to nora that this is a final goodbye , as he has determined that his death is near .
dr .
rank leaves , and torvald retrieves his letters .
as he reads them , nora steels herself to take her life .
torvald confronts her with krogstad's letter .
enraged , he declares that he is now completely in krogstad's power ; he must yield to krogstad's demands and keep quiet about the whole affair .
he berates nora , calling her a dishonest and immoral woman and telling her that she is unfit to raise their children .
he says that from now on their marriage will be only a matter of appearances .
a maid enters , delivering a letter to nora .
the letter is from krogstad , yet torvald demands to read the letter and takes it from nora .
torvald exults that he is saved , as krogstad has returned the incriminating bond , which torvald immediately burns along with krogstad's letters .
he takes back his harsh words to his wife and tells her that he forgives her .
nora realizes that her husband is not the strong and gallant man she thought he was , and that he truly loves himself more than he does nora .
torvald explains that when a man has forgiven his wife , it makes him love her all the more since it reminds him that she is totally dependent on him , like a child .
he dismisses the fact that nora had to make the agonizing choice between her conscience and his health , and ignores her years of secret efforts to free them from the ensuing obligations and the danger of loss of reputation .
he preserves his peace of mind by thinking of the incident as a mere mistake that she made owing to her foolishness , one of her most endearing feminine traits .
nora tells torvald that she is leaving him , and in a confrontational scene expresses her sense of betrayal and disillusionment .
she says he has never loved her , they have become strangers to each other .
she feels betrayed by his response to the scandal involving krogstad , and she says she must get away to understand herself .
she has lost her religion .
she says that she has been treated like a doll to play with for her whole life , first by her father and then by him .
concerned for the family reputation , torvald insists that she fulfill her duty as a wife and mother , but nora says that she has duties to herself that are just as important , and that she cannot be a good mother or wife without learning to be more than a plaything .
she reveals that she had expected that he would want to sacrifice his reputation for hers and that she had planned to kill herself to prevent him from doing so .
she now realizes that torvald is not at all the kind of person she had believed him to be and that their marriage has been based on mutual fantasies and misunderstandings .
torvald is unable to comprehend nora's point of view , since it contradicts all that he has been taught about the female mind throughout his life .
furthermore , he is so narcissistic that it is impossible for him to understand how he appears to her , as selfish , hypocritical , and more concerned with public reputation than with actual morality .
nora leaves her keys and wedding ring , and as torvald breaks down and begins to cry , baffled by what has happened , nora then leaves the house , slamming the door behind her .
whether or not she ever comes back is never made clear .
ibsen's german agent felt that the original ending would not play well in german theatres .
therefore , for it to be considered acceptable , ibsen was forced to write an alternative ending for the german premiere .
in this ending , nora is led to her children after having argued with torvald .
seeing them , she collapses , and the curtain is brought down .
ibsen later called the ending a disgrace to the original play and referred to it as a " barbaric outrage " .
virtually all productions today use the original ending , as do nearly all of the film versions of the play .
"a doll's house " was based on the life of laura kieler ( maiden name laura smith petersen ) , a good friend of ibsen .
much that happened between nora and torvald happened to laura and her husband , victor .
similar to the events in the play , laura signed an illegal loan to save her husband .
she wanted the money to find a cure for her husband's tuberculosis .
she wrote to ibsen , asking for his recommendation of her work to his publisher , thinking that the sales of her book would repay her debt .
at his refusal , she forged a check for the money .
at this point she was found out .
in real life , when victor discovered about laura's secret loan , he divorced her and had her committed to an asylum .
two years later , she returned to her husband and children at his urging , and she went on to become a well-known danish author , living to the age of *num* .
ibsen wrote " a doll's house " at the point when laura kieler had been committed to the asylum , and the fate of this friend of the family shook him deeply , perhaps also because laura had asked him to intervene at a crucial point in the scandal , which he did not feel able or willing to do .
instead , he turned this life situation into an aesthetically shaped , successful drama .
in the play , nora leaves torvald with head held high , though facing an uncertain future given the limitations single women faced in the society of the time .
kieler eventually rebounded from the shame of the scandal and had her own successful writing career while remaining discontented with sole recognition as " ibsen's nora " years afterwards .
ibsen started thinking about the play around may *num* , although he did not begin its first draft until a year later , having reflected on the themes and characters in the intervening period ( he visualised its protagonist , nora , for instance , as having approached him one day wearing " a blue woollen dress " ) .
he outlined his conception of the play as a " modern tragedy " in a note written in rome on *num* october *num* .
" a woman cannot be herself in modern society , " he argues , since it is " an exclusively male society , with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint .
" ibsen sent a fair copy of the completed play to his publisher on *num* september *num* .
it was first published in copenhagen on *num* december *num* , in an edition of *num* , *num* copies that sold out within a month ; a second edition of *num* , *num* copies followed on *num* january *num* , and a third edition of *num* , *num* was issued on *num* march .
"a doll's house " received its world premiere on *num* december *num* at the royal theatre in copenhagen , with betty hennings as nora , emil poulsen as torvald , and peter jerndorff as dr .
rank .
writing for the norwegian newspaper " folkets avis " , the critic erik bøgh admired ibsen's originality and technical mastery : " not a single declamatory phrase , no high dramatics , no drop of blood , not even a tear .
" every performance of its run was sold out .
another production opened at the royal theatre in stockholm , on *num* january *num* , while productions in christiania ( with johanne juell as nora and arnoldus reimers as torvald ) and bergen followed shortly after .
in germany , the actress hedwig niemann-raabe refused to perform the play as written , declaring , " "i " would never leave " my " children ! " since the playwright's wishes were not protected by copyright , ibsen decided to avoid the danger of being rewritten by a lesser dramatist by committing what he called a " barbaric outrage " on his play himself and giving it an alternative ending in which nora did not leave .
a production of this version opened in flensburg in february *num* .
this version was also played in hamburg , dresden , hanover , and berlin , although , in the wake of protests and a lack of success , niemann-raabe eventually restored the original ending .
another production of the original version , some rehearsals of which ibsen attended , opened on *num* march *num* at the residenz theatre in munich .
in great britain , the only way in which the play was initially allowed to be given in london was in an adaptation by henry arthur jones and henry herman called " breaking a butterfly " .
this adaptation was produced at the princess theatre , *num* march *num* .
writing in *num* in his book " the foundations of a national drama " , jones says : " a rough translation from the german version of a doll's house was put into my hands , and i was told that if it could be turned into a sympathetic play , a ready opening would be found for it on the london boards .
i knew nothing of ibsen , but i knew a great deal of robertson and h .
j .
byron .
from these circumstances came the adaptation called " breaking a butterfly " .
" h .
l .
mencken writes that it was " a doll’s house " “denaturized and dephlogisticated .
… toward the middle of the action ibsen was thrown to the fishes , and nora was saved from suicide , rebellion , flight and immortality by making a faithful old clerk steal her fateful promissory note from krogstad’s desk .
… the curtain fell upon a happy home .
“ before *num* there were two private productions of the play in london ( in its original form as ibsen wrote it ) — one featured george bernard shaw in the role of krogstad .
the first public british production of the play in its regular form opened on *num* june *num* at the novelty theatre , starring janet achurch as nora and charles charrington as torvald .
achurch played nora again for a 7-day run in *num* .
soon after its london premiere , achurch brought the play to australia in *num* .
the play was first seen in america in *num* in louisville , kentucky ; helena modjeska acted nora .
the play made its broadway premiere at the palmer's theatre on *num* december *num* , starring beatrice cameron as nora helmer .
it was first performed in france in *num* .
other productions in the united states include one in *num* starring minnie maddern fiske , a *num* adaptation with acting script by thornton wilder and starring ruth gordon , and a *num* production starring claire bloom .
a new translation by zinnie harris at the donmar warehouse , starring gillian anderson , toby stephens , anton lesser , tara fitzgerald and christopher eccleston opened in may *num* .
the play was performed by in march *num* , one of their early performances following their december *num* lower manhattan launch .
in august *num* , young vic , london , great britain , produced a new adaptation of " a doll's house " directed by carrie cracknell based on the english language version by simon stephens .
in september *num* , in partnership with brisbane festival , la boite located in brisbane , australia , hosted an adaptation of " a doll's house " written by lally katz and directed by stephen mitchell wright .
in june *num* , space arts centre in london staged an adaptation of " a doll's house " featuring the discarded alternate ending .
'manaveli ' toronto is preparing to stage a tamil version of " a doll's house " ( ஒரு பொம்மையின் வீடு ) on *num* june *num* , directed by mr p wikneswaran .
"a doll's house " questions the traditional roles of men and women in 19th-century marriage .
to many 19th-century europeans , this was scandalous .
the covenant of marriage was considered holy , and to portray it as ibsen did was controversial .
however , the irish playwright george bernard shaw found ibsen's willingness to examine society without prejudice exhilarating .
the swedish playwright august strindberg criticised the play in his volume of essays and short stories " getting married " ( *num* ) .
strindberg questioned nora's walking out and leaving her children behind with a man that she herself disapproved of so much that she would not remain with him .
strindberg also considers that nora's involvement with an illegal financial fraud that involved nora forging a signature , all done behind her husband's back , and then nora's lying to her husband regarding krogstad's blackmail , are serious crimes that should raise questions at the end of the play , when nora is moralistically judging her husband .
and strindberg points out that nora's complaint that she and torvald “have never exchanged one serious word about serious things , ” is contradicted by the discussions that occur in act one and two .
the reasons nora leaves her husband are complex , and various details are hinted at throughout the play .
in the last scene , she tells her husband she has been “greatly wronged” by his disparaging and condescending treatment of her , and his attitude towards her in their marriage — as though she were his “doll wife” — and the children in turn have become her “dolls , ” leading her to doubt her own qualifications to raise her children .
she is troubled by her husband's behavior in regard to the scandal of the loaned money .
she does not love her husband , she feels they are strangers , she feels completely confused , and suggests that her issues are shared by many women .
george bernard shaw suggests that she left to begin “a journey in search of self-respect and apprenticeship to life , ” and that her revolt is “the end of a chapter of human history .
” ibsen was inspired by the belief that " a woman cannot be herself in modern society , " since it is " an exclusively male society , with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint .
" its ideas can also be seen as having a wider application : michael meyer argued that the play's theme is not women's rights , but rather " the need of every individual to find out the kind of person he or she really is and to strive to become that person .
" in a speech given to the norwegian association for women's rights in *num* , ibsen insisted that he " must disclaim the honor of having consciously worked for the women's rights movement , " since he wrote " without any conscious thought of making propaganda , " his task having been " the " description of humanity " .
" because of the departure from traditional behavior and theatrical convention involved in nora's leaving home , her act of slamming the door as she leaves has come to represent the play itself .
in " iconoclasts " ( *num* ) , james huneker noted " that slammed door reverberated across the roof of the world .
epsilon ursae majoris epsilon ursae majoris ( latinised from ε ursae majoris , abbreviated epsilon uma , ε uma ) , officially named alioth , is , despite being designated " ε" ( epsilon ) , the brightest star in the constellation of ursa major , and at magnitude *num* .
*num* is the thirty-second brightest star in the sky .
it is the star in the tail of the bear closest to its body , and thus the star in the handle of the big dipper ( or plough ) closest to the bowl .
it is also a member of the large and diffuse ursa major moving group .
historically , the star was frequently used in celestial navigation in the maritime trade , because it is listed as one of the *num* navigational stars .
according to " hipparcos " , epsilon ursae majoris is from the sun .
its spectral type is a1p ; the " p " stands for " peculiar " , as its spectrum is characteristic of an α canum venaticorum variable .
epsilon ursae majoris , as a representative of this type , may harbor two interacting processes .
first , the star's strong magnetic field separating different elements in the star's hydrogen ' fuel ' .
in addition , a rotation axis at an angle to the magnetic axis may be spinning different bands of magnetically sorted elements into the line of sight between epsilon ursae majoris and the earth .
the intervening elements react differently at different frequencies of light as they whip in and out of view , causing epsilon ursae majoris to have very strange spectral lines that fluctuate over a period of *num* .
*num* days .
the " kb9 " suffix to the spectral type indicates that the calcium k line is present and representative of a b9 spectral type even though the rest of the spectrum indicates a1 .
epsilon ursae majoris's rotational and magnetic poles are at almost *num* degrees to one another .
darker ( denser ) regions of chromium form a band at right angles to the equator .
it has long been suspected that epsilon ursae majoris is a spectroscopic binary , possibly with more than one companion .
a more recent study suggests epsilon ursae majoris's *num* .
1-day variation may be due to a substellar object of about *num* .
*num* jupiter masses in an eccentric orbit ( e=0 .
*num* ) with an average separation of *num* .
*num* astronomical units .
it is now thought that the *num* .
1-day period is the rotation period of the star , and no companions have been detected using the most modern equipment .
epsilon ursae majoris has a relatively weak magnetic field , *num* times weaker than α canum venaticorum , but it is still *num* times stronger than that of the earth .
"ε ursae majoris " ( latinised to " epsilon ursae majoris " ) is the star's bayer designation .
the traditional name " alioth " comes from the arabic " alyat al-hamal " ( " the sheep's fat tail " ) .
in *num* , the international astronomical union organized a working group on star names ( wgsn ) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars .
the wgsn's first bulletin of july *num* included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the wgsn ; which included " alioth " for this star .
this star was known to the hindus as " añgiras " , one of the seven rishis .
in chinese , ( ) , meaning " northern dipper " , refers to an asterism consisting of epsilon ursae majoris , alpha ursae majoris , beta ursae majoris , gamma ursae majoris , delta ursae majoris , zeta ursae majoris and eta ursae majoris .
consequently , epsilon ursae majoris itself is known as ( , ) and ( , ) .
uss allioth ( ak-109 ) was a united states navy crater class cargo ship named after the star .
class action a class action , class suit , or representative action is a type of lawsuit where one of the parties is a group of people who are represented collectively by a member of that group .
the class action originated in the united states and is still predominantly a u .
s .
phenomenon , but canada , as well as several european countries with civil law have made changes in recent years to allow consumer organizations to bring claims on behalf of consumers .
in a typical class action , a plaintiff sues a defendant or a number of defendants on behalf of a group , or class , of absent parties .
this differs from a traditional lawsuit , where one party sues another party for redress of a wrong , and all of the parties are present in court .
although standards differ between states and countries , class actions are most common where the allegations involve a large number of people ( usually *num* or more ) who have been injured by the same defendant in the same way .
instead of each damaged person bringing his or her own lawsuit , the class action allows all the claims of all class members—whether they know they have been damaged or not—to be resolved in a single proceeding through the efforts of the representative plaintiff ( s ) and appointed class counsel .
the antecedent of the class action was what modern observers call " group litigation " , which appears to have been quite common in medieval england from about *num* onward .
these lawsuits involved groups of people either suing or being sued in actions at common law .
these groups were usually based on existing societal structures like villages , towns , parishes , and guilds .
unlike modern courts , the medieval english courts did not question the right of the actual plaintiffs to sue on behalf of a group or a few representatives to defend an entire group .
from *num* to *num* , group litigation gradually switched from being the norm in england to the exception .
the development of the concept of the corporation led to the wealthy supporters of the corporate form becoming suspicious of all unincorporated legal entities , which in turn led to the modern concept of the unincorporated or voluntary association .
the tumultuous history of the wars of the roses and then the star chamber resulted in periods during which the common law courts were frequently paralyzed , and out of the confusion the court of chancery emerged with exclusive jurisdiction over group litigation .
by *num* , parliament had enacted several statutes on a case-by-case basis to deal with issues regularly faced by certain types of organizations , like joint-stock companies , and with the impetus for most types of group litigation removed , it went into a steep decline in english jurisprudence from which it never recovered .
it was further weakened by the fact that equity pleading in general was falling into disfavor , which culminated in the judicature acts of *num* and *num* .
group litigation was essentially dead in england after *num* .
class actions survived in the united states thanks to the influence of supreme court associate justice joseph story , who imported it into u .
s .
law through summary discussions in his two equity treatises as well as his opinion in " west v .
randall " ( *num* ) .
however , story did not necessarily endorse class actions , because he " could not conceive of a modern function or a coherent theory for representative litigation " .
the oldest predecessor to the class-action rule in the united states was in the federal equity rules , specifically equity rule *num* , promulgated in *num* .
where the parties on either side are very numerous , and cannot , without manifest inconvenience and oppressive delays in the suit , be all brought before it , the court in its discretion may dispense with making all of them parties , and may proceed in the suit , having sufficient parties before it to represent all the adverse interests of the plaintiffs and the defendants in the suit properly before it .
but in such cases , the decree shall be without prejudice to the rights and claims of all the absent parties .
this allowed for representative suits in situations where there were too many individual parties ( which now forms the first requirement for class-action litigation – numerosity ) .
however , this rule did not allow such suits to bind similarly situated absent parties , which rendered the rule ineffective .
within ten years , the supreme court interpreted rule *num* in such a way so that it could apply to absent parties under certain circumstances , but only by ignoring the plain meaning of the rule .
in the rules published in *num* , equity rule *num* was replaced with equity rule *num* as part of a major restructuring of the equity rules , and when federal courts merged their legal and equitable procedural systems in *num* , equity rule *num* became rule *num* of the federal rules of civil procedure .
a major revision of the frcp in *num* radically transformed rule *num* , made the opt-out class action the standard option , and gave birth to the modern class action .
entire treatises have been written since to summarize the huge mass of law that sprang up from the *num* revision of rule *num* .
just as medieval group litigation bound all members of the group regardless of whether they all actually appeared in court , the modern class action binds " all " members of the class , except for those who choose to opt out ( if the rules permit them to do so ) .
the advisory committee that drafted the new rule *num* in the mid-1960s was influenced by two major developments .
first was the suggestion of harry kalven , jr .
and maurice rosenfield in *num* that class-action litigation by individual shareholders on behalf of all shareholders of a company could effectively supplement direct government regulation of securities markets and other similar markets .
the second development was the rise of the civil rights movement , environmentalism and consumerism .
the groups behind these movements , as well as many others in the 1960s , 1970s and 1980s , all turned to class actions as a means for achieving their goals .
for example , a *num* environmental law treatise reprinted the " entire " text of rule *num* and mentioned " class actions " *num* times in its index .
businesses targeted by class actions for inflicting massive aggregate harm have sought ways to avoid class actions altogether .
in the 1990s , the u .
s .
supreme court issued a number of decisions which strengthened the " federal policy favoring arbitration " .
in response , lawyers have added provisions to consumer contracts of adhesion called " collective action waivers " , which prohibit those signing the contracts from bringing class-action suits .
in *num* , the u .
s .
supreme court ruled in a 5–4 decision in " at&t mobility v .
concepcion " that the federal arbitration act of *num* preempts state laws that prohibit contracts from disallowing class-action lawsuits , which will make it more difficult for consumers to file class-action lawsuits .
the dissent pointed to a saving clause in the federal act which allowed states to determine how a contract or its clauses may be revoked .
in two major 21st-century cases , the supreme court ruled 5–4 against certification of class actions due to differences in each individual members ' circumstances : first in " wal-mart v .
dukes " ( *num* ) and later in " comcast corp .
v .
behrend " ( *num* ) .
companies may insert the phrase " may elect to resolve any claim by individual arbitration " into their consumer and employment contracts to use arbitration and prevent class-action lawsuits .
as of *num* , there was no publicly maintained list of nonsecurities class-action settlements , although a securities class-action database exists in the stanford law school securities class action clearinghouse and several for-profit companies maintain lists of the securities settlements .
one study of federal settlements required the researcher to manually search databases of lawsuits for the relevant records , although state class actions were not included due to the difficulty in gathering the information .
another source of data is u .
s .
bureau of justice statistics " civil justice survey of state courts " , which offers statistics for the year *num* .
proponents of class actions state that they offer a number of advantages because they aggregate a large number of individualized claims into one representational lawsuit .
first , aggregation can increase the efficiency of the legal process , and lower the costs of litigation .
in cases with common questions of law and fact , aggregation of claims into a class action may avoid the necessity of repeating " days of the same witnesses , exhibits and issues from trial to trial " .
" jenkins v .
raymark indus .
inc .
" , *num* f .
2d *num* , *num* ( *ord* cir .
*num* ) ( granting certification of a class action involving asbestos ) .
second , a class action may overcome " the problem that small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights " .
" amchem prods .
, inc .
v .
windsor " , *num* u .
s .
*num* , *num* ( *num* ) ( quoting " mace v .
van ru credit corp .
" , *num* f .
3d *num* , *num* ( *ord* cir .
*num* ) ) .
" a class action solves this problem by aggregating the relatively paltry potential recoveries into something worth someone's ( usually an attorney's ) labor .
" " amchem prods .
, inc .
" , *num* u .
s .
at *num* ( quoting " mace " , *num* f .
3d at *num* ) .
in other words , a class action ensures that a defendant who engages in widespread harmbut does so minimally against each individual plaintiffmust compensate those individuals for their injuries .
for example , thousands of shareholders of a public company may have losses too small to justify separate lawsuits , but a class action can be brought efficiently on behalf of all shareholders .
perhaps even more important than compensation is that class treatment of claims may be the only way to impose the costs of wrongdoing on the wrongdoer , thus deterring future wrongdoing .
third , class-action cases may be brought to purposely change behavior of a class of which the defendant is a member .
" landeros v .
flood " ( *num* ) was a landmark case decided by the california supreme court that aimed at purposefully changing the behavior of doctors , encouraging them to report suspected child abuse .
otherwise , they would face the threat of civil action for damages in tort proximately flowing from the failure to report the suspected injuries .
previously , many physicians had remained reluctant to report cases of apparent child abuse , despite existing law that required it .
fourth , in " limited fund " cases , a class action ensures that all plaintiffs receive relief and that early-filing plaintiffs do not raid the fund ( i .
e .
, the defendant ) of all its assets before other plaintiffs may be compensated .
see " ortiz v .
fibreboard corp .
" , *num* u .
s .
*num* ( *num* ) .
a class action in such a situation centralizes all claims into one venue where a court can equitably divide the assets amongst all the plaintiffs if they win the case .
finally , a class action avoids the situation where different court rulings could create " incompatible standards " of conduct for the defendant to follow .

*num* ( b ) ( *num* ) ( a ) .
for example , a court might certify a case for class treatment where a number of individual bond-holders sue to determine whether they may convert their bonds to common stock .
refusing to litigate the case in one trial could result in different outcomes and inconsistent standards of conduct for the defendant corporation .
thus , courts will generally allow a class action in such a situation .

whether a class action is superior to individual litigation depends on the case and is determined by the judge's ruling on a motion for class certification .
the advisory committee note to rule *num* , for example , states that mass torts are ordinarily " not appropriate " for class treatment .
class treatment may not improve the efficiency of a mass tort because the claims frequently involve individualized issues of law and fact that will have to be re-tried on an individual basis .
see " castano v .
am .
tobacco co .
" , *num* f .
3d *num* ( *ord* cir .
*num* ) ( rejecting nationwide class action against tobacco companies ) .
mass torts also involve high individual damage awards ; thus , the absence of class treatment will not impede the ability of individual claimants to seek justice .
see id .
other cases , however , may be more conducive to class treatment .
the preamble to the class action fairness act of *num* , passed by the united states congress , found : class-action lawsuits are an important and valuable part of the legal system when they permit the fair and efficient resolution of legitimate claims of numerous parties by allowing the claims to be aggregated into a single action against a defendant that has allegedly caused harm .
there are several criticisms of class actions .
the preamble to the class action fairness act stated that some abusive class actions harmed class members with legitimate claims and defendants that have acted responsibly , adversely affected interstate commerce , and undermined public respect for the country's judicial system .
class members often receive little or no benefit from class actions .
examples cited for this include large fees for the attorneys , while leaving class members with coupons or other awards of little or no value ; unjustified awards are made to certain plaintiffs at the expense of other class members ; and confusing notices are published that prevent class members from being able to fully understand and effectively exercise their rights .
for example , in the united states , class lawsuits sometimes bind all class members with a low settlement .
these " coupon settlements " ( which usually allow the plaintiffs to receive a small benefit such as a small check or a coupon for future services or products with the defendant company ) are a way for a defendant to forestall major liability by precluding a large number of people from litigating their claims separately , to recover reasonable compensation for the damages .
however , existing law requires judicial approval of all class-action settlements , and in most cases class members are given a chance to opt out of class settlement , though class members , despite opt-out notices , may be unaware of their right to opt out because they did not receive the notice , did not read it , or did not understand it .
the class action fairness act of *num* addresses these concerns .
coupon settlements may be scrutinized by an independent expert before judicial approval in order to ensure that the settlement will be of value to the class members ( *num* u .
s .
c .
a .
*num* ( d ) ) .
further , if the action provides for settlement in coupons , " the portion of any attorney’s fee award to class counsel that is attributable to the award of the coupons shall be based on the value to class members of the coupons that are redeemed " .
*num* u .

*num* ( a ) .
class action cases present significant ethical challenges .
defendants can hold reverse auctions and any of several parties can engage in collusive settlement discussions .
subclasses may have interests that diverge greatly from the class but may be treated the same .
proposed settlements could offer some groups ( such as former customers ) much greater benefits than others .
in one paper presented at an aba conference on class actions in *num* , authors commented that " competing cases can also provide opportunities for collusive settlement discussions and reverse auctions by defendants anxious to resolve their new exposure at the most economic cost " .
although normally plaintiffs are the class , defendant class actions are also possible .
for example , in *num* , the roman catholic archdiocese of portland in oregon was sued as part of the catholic priest sex-abuse scandal .
all parishioners of the archdiocese's churches were cited as a defendant class .
this was done to include their assets ( local churches ) in any settlement .
where both the plaintiffs and the defendants have been organized into court-approved classes , the action is called a bilateral class action .
in a class action , the plaintiff seeks court approval to litigate on behalf of a group of similarly situated persons .
not every plaintiff looks for , or could obtain , such approval .
as a procedural alternative , plaintiff's counsel may attempt to sign up every similarly situated person that counsel can find as a client .
plaintiff's counsel can then join the claims of all of these persons in one complaint , a so-called " mass action " , hoping to have the same efficiencies and economic leverage as if a class had been certified .
because mass actions operate outside the detailed procedures laid out for class actions , they can pose special difficulties for both plaintiffs , defendants , and the court .
for example , settlement of class actions follows a predictable path of negotiation with class counsel and representatives , court scrutiny , and notice .
there may not be a way to uniformly settle all of the many claims brought via a mass action .
some states permit plaintiff's counsel to settle for all the mass action plaintiffs according to a majority vote , for example .
other states , such as new jersey , require each plaintiff to approve the settlement of that plaintiff's own individual claims .
class actions were recognized in " halabi " leading case ( supreme court , *num* ) .
class actions became part of the australian legal landscape only when the federal parliament amended the federal court of australia act ( " the fcaa " ) in *num* to introduce the " representative proceedings " , the equivalent of the american " class actions " .
likewise , class actions appeared slowly in new zealand legal system .
however , a group can bring litigation through the action of a representative under the high court rules which provide that one or a multitude of persons may sue on behalf of , or for the benefit of , all persons " with the same interest in the subject matter of a proceeding " .
the presence and expansion of litigation funders have been playing a significant role in the emergence of class actions in new zealand .
for example , the " fair play on fees " proceedings in relation to penalty fees charged by banks was funded by litigation lending services ( lls ) , a company specializing in the funding and management of litigation in australia and new zealand .
it was the biggest class-action suit in new zealand history .
the austrian code of civil procedure ( " zivilprozessordnung" – zpo ) does not provide for a special proceeding for complex class-action litigation .
however , austrian consumer organizations ( " verein für konsumenteninformation " ( vki ) and the federal chamber of labour / " bundesarbeitskammer " ) have , in recent years , brought claims on behalf of hundreds or even thousands of consumers .
in these cases the individual consumers assigned their claims to one entity , who has then brought an ordinary ( two party ) lawsuit over the assigned claims .
the monetary benefits were redistributed among the class .
this technique , soon labelled as " class action austrian style " , allows for a significant reduction of overall costs .
the austrian supreme court , in a recent judgment , has confirmed the legal admissibility of these lawsuits under the condition that all claims are essentially based on the same grounds .
the austrian parliament has unanimously requested the austrian federal minister for justice to examine the possibility of new legislation providing for a cost-effective and appropriate way to deal with mass claims .
together with the austrian ministry for social security , generations and consumer protection , the justice ministry opened the discussion with a conference held in vienna in june , *num* .
with the aid of a group of experts from many fields , the justice ministry began drafting the new law in september , *num* .
with the individual positions varying greatly , a political consensus could not be reached .
provincial laws in canada allow class actions .
all provinces permit plaintiff classes and some permit defendant classes .
quebec was the first province to enact class proceedings legislation in *num* .
ontario was next with the class proceedings act , *num* .
as of *num* , *num* of *num* provinces have enacted comprehensive class actions legislation .

of the federal courts rules .
legislation in saskatchewan , manitoba , ontario , and nova scotia expressly or by judicial opinion has been read to allow for what are informally known as national " opt-out " class actions , whereby residents of other provinces may be included in the class definition and potentially be bound by the court's judgment on common issues unless they opt out in a prescribed manner and time .
court rulings have determined that this permits a court in one province to include residents of other provinces in the class action on an " opt-out " basis .
recent judicial opinions have indicated that provincial legislative national opt-out powers should not be exercised to interfere with the ability of another province to certify a parallel class action for residents of other provinces .
the first court to certify will generally exclude residents of provinces whose courts have certified a parallel class action .
however , in the vioxx litigation , two provincial courts recently certified overlapping class actions whereby canadian residents are class members in two class actions in two provinces .
both decisions are under appeal .

chile approved class actions in *num* .
the chilean model is technically an opt-out issue class action followed by a compensatory stage which can be collective or individual .
this means that the class action is designed to declare the defendant generally liable with " erga omnes " effects if and only if the defendant is found liable , and the declaratory judgment can be used then to pursue damages in the same procedure or in individual ones in different jurisdictions .
if the latter is the case , the liability cannot be discussed but only the damages .
there under the chilean procedural rules , one particular case works as an opt-out class action for damages .
this is the case when defendants can identify and compensate consumer directly , i .
e .
because it is their banking institution .
in such cases the judge can skip the compensatory stage and order redress directly .

decisions of the indian supreme court in the 1980s loosened strict " locus standi " requirements to permit the filing of suits on behalf of rights deprived sections of society by public minded individuals or bodies .
although not strictly " class action litigation " as it is understood in american law , public interest litigation arose out of the wide powers of judicial review granted to the supreme court of india and the various high courts under and article *num* of the constitution of india , respectively .
the sort of remedies sought from courts in public interest litigation go beyond mere award of damages to all affected groups and have sometimes ( controversially ) gone on to include court monitoring of the implementation of legislation and even the framing of guidelines in the absence of parliamentary legislation .
however , this innovative jurisprudence did not help the victims of the bhopal gas tragedy , who were unable to fully prosecute a class-action litigation ( as understood in the american sense ) against union carbide due to procedural rules that would make such litigation impossible to conclude and unwieldy to carry out .
instead , the government of india exercised its right of " parens patriae " to appropriate all the claims of the victims and proceeded to litigate on their behalf , first in the new york courts and later , in the indian courts .
ultimately , the matter was settled between the union of india and union carbide ( in a settlement overseen by the supreme court of india ) for a sum of as a complete settlement of all claims of all victims for all time to come .
public interest litigation has now broadened in scope to cover larger and larger groups of citizens who may be affected by government inaction .
recent examples of this trend include the conversion of all public transport in the city of delhi from diesel engines to cng engines on the basis of the orders of the delhi high court ; the monitoring of forest use by the high courts and the supreme court to ensure that there is no unjustified loss of forest cover ; and the directions mandating the disclosure of assets of electoral candidates for the houses of parliament and state assembly .
of late , the supreme court has observed that the pil has tended to become a means to gain publicity or obtain relief contrary to constitutionally valid legislation and policy .
observers point out that many high courts and certain supreme court judges are reluctant to entertain pils filed by non-governmental organizations and activists , citing concerns of separation of powers and parliamentary sovereignty .
dutch law allows associations ( " verenigingen " ) and foundations ( " stichtingen " ) to bring a so-called collective action on behalf of other persons , provided they can represent the interests of such persons according to their by-laws ( " statuten " ) ( section *num* : 305a dutch civil code ) .
all types of actions are permitted , excluding a claim for monetary damages .
most class actions over the past decade have been in the field of securities fraud and financial services .
the acting association or foundation may come to a collective settlement with the defendant .
the settlement may also include – and usually primarily consists of – monetary compensation of damages .
such settlement can be declared binding for all injured parties by the amsterdam court of appeal ( section *num* : *num* dutch civil code ) .
the injured parties have an opt-out right during the opt-out period set by the court , usually *num* to *num* months .
settlements involving injured parties from outside the netherlands can also be declared binding by the court .
since us courts are reluctant to take up class actions brought on behalf of injured parties not residing in the us who have suffered damages due to acts or omissions committed outside the us , combinations of us class actions and dutch collective actions may come to a settlement that covers plaintiffs worldwide .
an example of this is the royal dutch shell oil reserves settlement that was declared binding upon both us and non-us plaintiffs .

recent changes to spanish civil procedure rules include the introduction of a quasi-class action right for certain consumer associations to claim damages on behalf of unidentified classes of consumers .
the rules require consumer associations to represent an adequate number of affected parties who have suffered the same harm .
also any judgment made by the spanish court will list the individual beneficiaries or , if that is not possible , conditions that need to be fulfilled for a party to benefit from a judgment .
swiss law does not allow for any form of class action .
when the government proposed a new federal code of civil procedure in *num* , replacing the cantonal codes of civil procedure , it rejected the introduction of class actions , arguing that the civil procedure rules of the courts of england and wales came into force in *num* and have provided for representative actions in limited circumstances ( under part *num* .
*num* ) .
these have not been much used , with only two reported cases at the court of first instance in the first ten years after the civil procedure rules took effect .
however , a sectoral mechanism was adopted by the consumer rights act *num* , taking effect on october *num* , *num* .
under the provisions therein , opt-in or opt-out collective procedures may be certified for breaches of competition law .
this is currently the closest mechanism to a class action in england and wales .
in the united states , the class representative , also called a lead plaintiff , named plaintiff , or representative plaintiff is the named party in a class-action lawsuit .
although the class representative is named as a party to the litigation , the court must approve the class representative when it certifies the lawsuit as a class action .
the class representative must be able to represent the interests of all the members of the class , by being typical of the class members and not having conflicts with them .
he or she is responsible to hire the attorney , file the lawsuit , consult on the case , and agree to any settlement .
in exchange , the class representative may be entitled to compensation ( at the discretion of the court ) out of the recovery amount .

§ *num* ( d ) .
cases in federal courts are only allowed to proceed as class actions if the court has jurisdiction to hear the case , and if the case meets the criteria set out in rule *num* .
in the vast majority of federal class actions , the class is acting as the plaintiff .
however , rule *num* also provides for defendant class actions .
typically , federal courts are thought to be more favorable for defendants , and state courts more favorable for plaintiffs .
many class actions are filed initially in state court .
the defendant will frequently try to remove the case to federal court .
the class action fairness act of *num* increases defendants ' ability to remove state cases to federal court by giving federal courts original jurisdiction for all class actions with damages exceeding $5 , *num* , *num* exclusive of interest and costs .
it should be noted , however , that the class action fairness act contains carve-outs for , among other things , shareholder class actions covered by the private securities litigation reform act of *num* and those concerning internal corporate governance issues ( the latter typically being brought as shareholder derivative actions in the state courts of delaware , the state of incorporation of most large corporations ) .
class actions may be brought in federal court if the claim arises under federal law or if the claim falls under *num* u .

§ *num* ( d ) .
under § *num* ( d ) ( *num* ) the federal district courts have original jurisdiction over any civil action where the amount in controversy exceeds $5 , *num* , *num* and nationwide plaintiff classes are possible , but such suits must have a commonality of issues across state lines .
this may be difficult if the civil law in the various states lack significant commonalities .
large class actions brought in federal court frequently are consolidated for pre-trial purposes through the device of multidistrict litigation ( mdl ) .
it is also possible to bring class actions under state law , and in some cases the court may extend its jurisdiction to all the members of the class , including out of state ( or even internationally ) as the key element is the jurisdiction that the court has over the defendant .
for the case to proceed as a class action and bind absent class members , the court must certify the class under rule *num* on a motion from the party wishing to proceed on a class basis .
for a class to be certified , the moving party must meet all of the criteria listed under rule *num* ( a ) , and at least one of the criteria listed under rule *num* ( b ) .
the *num* ( a ) criteria are referred to as numerosity , commonality , typicality , and adequacy .
numerosity refers to the number of people in the class .
to be certified , the class has to have enough members that simply adding each of them as a named party to the lawsuit would be impractical .
there is no bright-line rule to determine numerosity , but classes with hundreds of members are generally deemed to be sufficiently numerous .
to satisfy commonality , there must be a common question of law and fact such that " determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke " .
the typicality requirement ensures that the claims or defenses of the named plaintiff are typical of those of everyone else in the class .
finally , adequacy requirement states that the named plaintiff must fairly and adequately represent the interests of the absent class members .
in *num* , the us supreme court decided to hear an appeal of ninth circuit decision that allowed a class-action settlement that awarded $2 million to the plaintiff's attorneys , $5 , *num* to each of the handful of named plaintiffs , and no monetary award to an estimated *num* million class members , instead citing the cy-près doctrine to give a handful of privacy groups ( including all three plaintiffs ' attorneys ' alma maters and several groups already supported by defendant google ) a share of $6 million rather than any monetary award to class members ( who would receive approximately four cents ) .
the case , " frank v .
gaos " , which challenges that the award was not " fair , reasonable , and adequate " , will be heard by the supreme court during its october 2018-june *num* session .
class members in rule *num* certified classes are , generally , subject to an opt-out mechanism , meaning that they ( once the class definition is certified ) are participants in the matter unless they opt-out ( i .
e .
, affirmatively exclude themselves therefrom ) .
this procedure is followed , and class members are bound , regardless of whether they received actual notice , so long as the notice issued met the requisite due process requirements .
conversely , some types of class actions or so-called " collective actions " ( e .
g .
, actions to enforce the federal fair labor standards act or the age discrimination in employment act of *num* ) are opt-in actions brought pursuant to *num* u .
s .
c .
§216 ( b ) ( see , also *num* u .
s .
c .
§ *num* ( b ) ) .
in such " 216b " actions , class members are not bound by the results of the collective action , and their claims are not tolled during the pendency thereof , until they opt-in by filing a consent to join the litigation .
due to the tenuous rights of class members in collective actions prior to opt-in , certification in such actions is subject to a much lower standard .
due process requires in most cases that notice describing the class action be sent , published , or broadcast to class members .
as part of this notice procedure , there may have to be several notices , first a notice giving class members the opportunity to opt out of the class , i .
e .
if individuals wish to proceed with their own litigation they are entitled to do so , only to the extent that they give timely notice to the class counsel or the court that they are opting out .
second , if there is a settlement proposal , the court will usually direct the class counsel to send a settlement notice to all the members of the certified class , informing them of the details of the proposed settlement .
since *num* , many states have adopted rules similar to the frcp .
however , some states , like california , have civil procedure systems , which deviate significantly from the federal rules ; the california codes provide for four separate types of class actions .
as a result , there are two separate treatises devoted solely to the complex topic of california class actions .
some states , such as virginia , do not provide for any class actions , while others , such as new york , limit the types of claims that may be brought as class actions .
classical guitar the classical guitar ( also known as the nylon-string guitar or spanish guitar ) is a member of the guitar family used in classical music .
an acoustic wooden string instrument with strings made of gut or nylon , it is a precursor of the acoustic and electric guitars which use metal strings .
classical guitars are derived from the spanish vihuela and gittern in the fifteenth and sixteenth century , which later evolved into the seventeenth and eighteenth century baroque guitar and later the modern classical guitar in the mid nineteenth century .
for a right-handed player , the traditional classical guitar has twelve frets clear of the body and is properly held on the left leg , so that the hand that plucks or strums the strings does so near the back of the sound hole ( this is called the classical position ) .
the modern steel string guitar , on the other hand , usually has fourteen frets clear of the body ( see dreadnought ) and is commonly played off the hip .
the phrase " classical guitar " may refer to either of two concepts other than the instrument itself : the term " modern classical guitar " is sometimes used to distinguish the classical guitar from older forms of guitar , which are in their broadest sense also called " classical " , or more specifically , " early guitars " .
examples of early guitars include the six-string early romantic guitar ( c .
1790–1880 ) , and the earlier baroque guitars with five courses .
the materials and the methods of classical guitar construction may vary , but the typical shape is either " modern classical guitar " or that " historic classical guitar " similar to the early romantic guitars of france and italy .
classical guitar strings once made of gut are now made of such polymers as nylon , with fine wire wound about the acoustically lower ( bass side ) strings .
a guitar family tree may be identified .
the flamenco guitar derives from the modern classical , but has differences in material , construction and sound .
today's " modern classical guitar " was established by the late designs of the 19th-century spanish luthier , antonio torres jurado .
the classical guitar has a long history and one is able to distinguish various : both instrument and repertoire can be viewed from a combination of various perspectives : historical ( chronological period of time ) geographical cultural while " classical guitar " is today mainly associated with the modern classical guitar design , there is an increasing interest in early guitars ; and understanding the link between historical repertoire and the particular period guitar that was originally used to perform this repertoire .
the musicologist and author graham wade writes : nowadays it is customary to play this repertoire on reproductions of instruments authentically modelled on concepts of musicological research with appropriate adjustments to techniques and overall interpretation .
thus over recent decades we have become accustomed to specialist artists with expertise in the art of vihuela ( a 16th-century type of guitar popular in spain ) , lute , baroque guitar , 19th-century guitar , etc .
different types of guitars have different sound aesthetics , e .
g .
different colour-spectrum characteristics ( the way the sound energy is spread in the fundamental frequency and the overtones ) , different response , etc .
these differences are due to differences in construction ; for example modern classical guitars usually use a different bracing ( fan-bracing ) from that used in earlier guitars ( they had ladder-bracing ) ; and a different voicing was used by the luthier .
there is a historical parallel between musical styles ( baroque , classical , romantic , flamenco , jazz ) and the style of " sound aesthetic " of the musical instruments used , for example : robert de visée played a baroque guitar with a very different sound aesthetic from the guitars used by mauro giuliani and luigi legnani – they used *ord* century guitars .
these guitars in turn sound different from the torres models used by segovia that are suited for interpretations of romantic-modern works such as moreno torroba .
when considering the guitar from a historical perspective , the musical instrument used is as important as the musical language and style of the particular period .
as an example : it is impossible to play a historically informed de visee or corbetta ( baroque guitarist-composers ) on a modern classical guitar .
the reason is that the baroque guitar used courses , which are two strings close together ( in unison ) , that are plucked together .
this gives baroque guitars an unmistakable sound characteristic and tonal texture that is an integral part of an interpretation .
additionally the sound aesthetic of the baroque guitar ( with its strong overtone presence ) is very different from modern classical type guitars , as is shown below .
today's use of torres and post-torres type guitars for repertoire of all periods is sometimes critically viewed : torres and post-torres style modern guitars ( with their fan-bracing and design ) have a thick and strong tone , very suitable for modern-era repertoire .
however , they are considered to emphasize the fundamental too heavily ( at the expense of overtone partials ) for earlier repertoire ( classical / romantic : carulli , sor , giuliani , mertz , .
.
.
; baroque : de visee , .
.
.
; etc .
) .
" andrés segovia presented the spanish guitar as a versatile model for all playing styles " to the extent , that still today , " many guitarists have tunnel-vision of the world of the guitar , coming from the modern segovia tradition " .
while fan-braced modern classical torres and post-torres style instruments coexisted with traditional ladder-braced guitars at the beginning of the *ord* century , the traditional forms eventually fell away .
some attribute this to the popularity of segovia , considering him " the catalyst for change toward the spanish design and the so-called ' modern ' school in the 1920s and beyond .
" the styles of music performed on ladder-braced guitars were becoming more and more unfashionable ; and , e .
g .
in germany , musicians were in part turning towards folk music ( schrammel-music and the contraguitar ) , but this only remained localized in germany and austria and became unfashionable again .
on the other hand , segovia was playing in concerts around the world , popularizing his modern classical guitar , as well as a new style of music in the 1920s : spanish romantic-modern style with guitar works by moreno torroba , de falla , etc .
some people consider it to have been this influence of segovia which led to the domination of the torres instrument .
factories all over the world began producing them in large numbers .
it was the 19th-century classical guitarist francisco tárrega who first popularized the torres design as a classical solo instrument .
composers of the renaissance period who wrote for four course guitar include alonso mudarra , miguel de fuenllana , adrian le roy , gregoire brayssing , guillaume de morlaye , and simon gorlier .
four-course guitar some well known composers of the baroque guitar were gaspar sanz , robert de visée , francesco corbetta and santiago de murcia .
from approximately *num* to *num* , the guitar had numerous composers and performers including : hector berlioz studied the guitar as a teenager , franz schubert owned at least two and wrote for the instrument , ludwig van beethoven , after hearing giuliani play , commented the instrument was " a miniature orchestra in itself " .
niccolò paganini was also a guitar virtuoso and composer .
he once wrote : " i love the guitar for its harmony ; it is my constant companion in all my travels " .
he also said , on another occasion : " i do not like this instrument , but regard it simply as a way of helping me to think " the guitarist and composer francisco tárrega ( november *num* , *num* – december *num* , *num* ) was one of the great guitar virtuosos and teachers and is considered the father of modern classical guitar playing .
as professor of guitar at the conservatories of madrid and barcelona , he defined many elements of the modern classical technique and elevated the importance of the guitar in the classical music tradition .
at the beginning of the 1920s , andrés segovia popularized the guitar with tours and early phonograph recordings .
segovia collaborated with the composers federico moreno torroba and joaquin turina with the aim of extending the guitar repertoire with new music .
segovia's tour of south america revitalized public interest in the guitar and helped the guitar music of manuel ponce and heitor villa-lobos reach a wider audience .
the composers alexandre tansman and mario castelnuovo-tedesco were commissioned by segovia to write new pieces for the guitar .
luiz bonfá popularized brazilian musical styles such as the newly created bossa nova , which was well received by audiences in the usa .
the classical guitar repertoire also includes modern contemporary works – sometimes termed " new music " – such as elliott carter's " changes " , cristóbal halffter's " codex i " , luciano berio's " sequenza xi " , maurizio pisati's " sette studi " , maurice ohana's " si le jour paraît " , sylvano bussotti's " rara ( eco sierologico ) " , ernst krenek's " suite für guitarre allein , op .
*num* " , franco donatoni's " algo : due pezzi per chitarra " , paolo coggiola's " variazioni notturne " , etc .
performers who are known for including modern repertoire include jürgen ruck , elena càsoli , leo brouwer ( when he was still performing ) , john schneider , reinbert evers , maria kämmerling , siegfried behrend , david starobin , mats scheidegger , magnus andersson , etc .
this type of repertoire is usually performed by guitarists who have particularly chosen to focus on the avant-garde in their performances .
within the contemporary music scene itself , there are also works which are generally regarded as extreme .
these include works such as brian ferneyhough's " kurze schatten ii " , sven-david sandström's " away from " and rolf riehm's " toccata orpheus " , etc .
which are notorious for their extreme difficulty .
there are also a variety of databases documenting modern guitar works such as sheer pluck and others .
the evolution of the classical guitar and its repertoire spans more than four centuries .
it has a history that was shaped by contributions from earlier instruments , such as the lute , the vihuela , and the baroque guitar .
the origins of the modern guitar are not known with certainty .
some believe it is indigenous to europe , while others think it is an imported instrument .
guitar-like instruments appear in ancient carvings and statues recovered from egyptian , sumerian , and babylonian civilizations .
this means that the contemporary iranian instruments such as the tanbur and setar are distantly related to the european guitar , as they all derive ultimately from the same ancient origins , but by very different historical routes and influences .
during the late middle ages , gitterns called " guitars " were in use , but their construction and tuning was different from modern guitars .
the " guitarra latina " in spain , had curved sides and a single hole .
the " guitarra morisca " , which appears to have had moorish influences , had an oval soundbox and many sound holes on its soundboard .
by the *ord* century , a four course double-string instrument called the vihuela de mano , that had tuning like the later modern guitar except on one string and similar construction , first appeared in spain and spread to france and italy .
in the *ord* century , a fifth double-string was added .
during this time , composers wrote mostly in tablature notation .
in the middle of the *ord* century , influences from the vihuela and the renaissance guitar were combined and the baroque five string guitar appeared in spain .
the baroque guitar quickly superseded the vihuela in popularity in spain , france and italy and italian players and composers became prominent .
in the late *ord* century the six string guitar quickly became popular at the expense of the five string guitars .
during the *ord* century the spanish luthier and player antonio de torres gave the modern classical guitar its definitive form , with a broadened body , increased waist curve , thinned belly , improved internal bracing .
the modern classical guitar replaced an older form for the accompaniment of song and dance called flamenco , and a modified version , known as the flamenco guitar , was created .
alonso de mudarra's book " tres libros de música " , published in spain in *num* , contains the earliest known written pieces for a four-course guitarra .
this four-course " guitar " was popular in france , spain , and italy .
in france this instrument gained popularity among aristocrats .
a considerable volume of music was published in paris from the 1550s to the 1570s : simon gorlier's le troysième livre .
.
.
mis en tablature de guiterne was published in *num* .
in *num* adrian le roy also published his premier livre de tablature de guiterne , and in the same year he also published briefve et facile instruction pour apprendre la tablature a bien accorder , conduire , et disposer la main sur la guiterne .
robert ballard , grégoire brayssing from augsburg , and guillaume morlaye ( c .
*num* – c .
*num* ) significantly contributed to its repertoire .
morlaye's le premier livre de chansons , gaillardes , pavannes , bransles , almandes , fantasies – which has a four-course instrument illustrated on its title page – was published in partnership with michel fedenzat , and among other music , they published six books of tablature by lutenist albert de rippe ( who was very likely guillaume's teacher ) .
the written history of the classical guitar can be traced back to the early *ord* century with the development of the " vihuela " in spain .
while the lute was then becoming popular in other parts of europe , the spaniards did not take to it well because of its association with the moors .
instead , the lute-like vihuela appeared with two more strings that gave it more range and complexity .
in its most developed form , the vihuela was a guitar-like instrument with six double strings made of gut , tuned like a modern classical guitar with the exception of the third string , which was tuned half a step lower .
it has a high sound and is rather large to hold .
few have survived and most of what is known today comes from diagrams and paintings .
the earliest extant six-string guitar is believed to have been built in *num* by gaetano vinaccia ( *num* – after *num* ) in naples , italy ; however , the date on the label is a little ambiguous .
the vinaccia family of luthiers is known for developing the mandolin .
this guitar has been examined and does not show tell-tale signs of modifications from a double-course guitar .
the authenticity of guitars allegedly produced before the 1790s is often in question .
this also corresponds to when moretti's 6-string method appeared , in *num* .
the modern classical guitar is usually played in a seated position , with the instrument resting on the left lap – and the left foot placed on a footstool .
alternatively – if a footstool is not used – a " guitar support " can be placed between the guitar and the left lap ( the support usually attaches to the instrument's side with suction cups ) .
( there are of course exceptions , with some performers choosing to hold the instrument another way .
) right-handed players use the fingers of the right hand to pluck the strings , with the thumb plucking from the top of a string downwards ( downstroke ) and the other fingers plucking from the bottom of string upwards ( upstroke ) .
the little finger in classical technique as it evolved in the *ord* century is used only to ride along with the ring finger without striking the strings and to thus physiologically facilitate the ring finger's motion .
in contrast , flamenco technique , and classical compositions evoking flamenco , employ the little finger semi-independently in the flamenco four-finger rasgueado , that rapid strumming of the string by the fingers in reverse order employing the back of the fingernail—a familiar characteristic of flamenco .
flamenco technique , in the performance of the rasgueado also uses the upstroke of the four fingers and the downstroke of the thumb : the string is hit not only with the inner , fleshy side of the fingertip but also with the outer , fingernail side .
this was also used in a technique of the vihuela called dedillo which has recently begun to be introduced on the classical guitar .
some modern guitarists , such as štěpán rak and kazuhito yamashita , use the little finger independently , compensating for the little finger's shortness by maintaining an extremely long fingernail .
rak and yamashita have also generalized the use of the upstroke of the four fingers and the downstroke of the thumb ( the same technique as in the rasgueado of the flamenco : as explained above the string is hit not only with the inner , fleshy side of the fingertip but also with the outer , fingernail side ) both as a free stroke and as a rest stroke .
as with other plucked instruments ( such as the lute ) , the musician directly touches the strings ( usually plucking ) to produce the sound .
this has important consequences : different tone / timbre ( of a single note ) can be produced by plucking the string in different manners and in different positions .
for example , plucking an open string will sound brighter than playing the same note ( s ) on a fretted position ( which would have a warmer tone ) .
the instrument's versatility means it can create a variety of tones , but this also makes the instrument harder to learn than a standard acoustic guitar .
in guitar " scores " the five fingers of the right-hand ( which pluck the strings ) are designated by the first letter of their spanish names namely p = thumb ( " pulgar " ) , i = index finger ( " índice " ) , m = middle finger ( " mayor " ) , a = ring finger ( " anular " ) , c = little finger or pinky ( " meñique / chiquito " ) the four fingers of the left hand ( which stop the strings ) are designated *num* = index , *num* = major , *num* = ring finger , *num* = little finger ; *num* designates an open string , that is a string that is not stopped by a finger of the left hand and whose full length thus vibrates when plucked .
on the classical guitar thumb of the left hand is never used to stop strings from above ( as is done on the electric guitar ) : the neck of a classical guitar is too wide and the normal position of the thumb used in classical guitar technique do not make that possible .
scores ( contrary to " tablatures " ) do not systematically indicate the string to be plucked ( although in most cases the choice is obvious ) .
when an indication of the string is required the strings are designated *num* to *num* ( from the *ord* the high e to the *ord* the low e ) with figures *num* to *num* inside circles .
the positions ( that is where on the fretboard the first finger of the left hand is placed ) are also not systematically indicated , but when they are ( mostly in the case of the execution of " barrés " ) these are indicated with roman numerals from the first position i ( index finger of the left hand placed on the *ord* fret : f-b flat-e flat-a flat-c-f ) to the twelfth position xii ( the index finger of the left hand placed on the *ord* fret : e-a-d-g-b-e ; the *ord* fret is placed where the body begins ) or even higher up to position xix ( the classical guitar most often having *num* frets , with the *ord* fret being most often split and not being usable to fret the *ord* and *ord* strings ) .
to achieve tremolo effects and rapid , fluent scale passages , the player must practice alternation , that is , never plucking a string with the same finger twice in a row .
using p to indicate the thumb , i the index finger , m the middle finger and a the ring finger , common alternation patterns include : music written specifically for the classical guitar dates from the addition of the sixth string ( the baroque guitar normally had five pairs of strings ) in the late *ord* century .
a guitar recital may include a variety of works , e .
g .
works written originally for the lute or vihuela by composers such as john dowland ( b .
england *num* ) and luis de narváez ( b .
spain c .
*num* ) , and also music written for the harpsichord by domenico scarlatti ( b .
italy *num* ) , for the baroque lute by sylvius leopold weiss ( b .
germany *num* ) , for the baroque guitar by robert de visée ( b .
france c .
*num* ) or even spanish-flavored music written for the piano by isaac albéniz ( b .
spain *num* ) and enrique granados ( b .
spain *num* ) .
the most important composer who did not write for the guitar but whose music is often played on it is johann sebastian bach ( b .
germany *num* ) , whose baroque lute works have proved highly adaptable to the instrument .
of music written originally for guitar , the earliest important composers are from the classical period and include fernando sor ( b .
spain *num* ) and mauro giuliani ( b .
italy *num* ) , both of whom wrote in a style strongly influenced by viennese classicism .
in the *ord* century guitar composers such as johann kaspar mertz ( b .
slovakia , austria *num* ) were strongly influenced by the dominance of the piano .
not until the end of the nineteenth century did the guitar begin to establish its own unique identity .
francisco tárrega ( b .
spain *num* ) was central to this , sometimes incorporating stylized aspects of flamenco's moorish influences into his romantic miniatures .
this was part of late *ord* century mainstream european musical nationalism .
albéniz and granados were central to this movement ; their evocation of the guitar was so successful that their compositions have been absorbed into standard guitar repertoire .
the steel-string and electric guitars characteristic to the rise of rock and roll in the post-wwii era became more widely played in north america and the english speaking world .
agustín barrios mangoré of paraguay composed many works and brought into the mainstream the characteristics of latin american music , as did the brazilian composer heitor villa-lobos .
andrés segovia commissioned works from spanish composers such as federico moreno torroba and joaquín rodrigo , italians such as mario castelnuovo-tedesco and latin american composers such as manuel ponce of mexico .
other prominent latin american composers are leo brouwer of cuba , antonio lauro of venezuela and enrique solares of guatemala .
julian bream of britain managed to get nearly every british composer from william walton to benjamin britten to peter maxwell davies to write significant works for guitar .
bream's collaborations with tenor peter pears also resulted in song cycles by britten , lennox berkeley and others .
there are significant works by composers such as hans werner henze of germany , gilbert biberian of england and roland chadwick of australia .
the classical guitar also became widely used in popular music and rock & roll in the 1960s after guitarist mason williams popularized the instrument in his instrumental hit classical gas .
guitarist christopher parkening is quoted in the book " classical gas : the music of mason williams " as saying that it is the most requested guitar piece besides malagueña and perhaps the best known instrumental guitar piece today .
in the field of new flamenco , the works and performances of spanish composer and player paco de lucía are known worldwide .
not many classical guitar concertos were written through the guitar history .
nevertheless , some guitar concertos are nowadays wide known and popular , especially joaquín rodrigo's " concierto de aranjuez " ( with the famous theme from *ord* movement ) and " fantasía para un gentilhombre " .
composers , who also wrote famous guitar concertos are : antonio vivaldi ( originally for mandolin or lute ) , mauro giuliani , heitor villa-lobos , mario castelnuovo-tedesco , manuel ponce , leo brouwer , lennox berkeley .
.
.
nowadays , more and more contemporary composers decide to write a guitar concerto , among them " bosco sacro " by federico biscione , for guitar and string orchestra , is one of the most inspired .
the classical guitar is distinguished by a number of characteristics : the fretboard ( also called the fingerboard ) is a piece of wood embedded with metal frets that constitutes the top of the neck .
it is flat or slightly curved .
the curvature of the fretboard is measured by the fretboard radius , which is the radius of a hypothetical circle of which the fretboard's surface constitutes a segment .
the smaller the fretboard radius , the more noticeably curved the fretboard is .
fretboards are most commonly made of ebony , but may also be made of rosewood , some other hardwood , or of phenolic composite ( " micarta " ) .
frets are the metal strips ( usually nickel alloy or stainless steel ) embedded along the fingerboard and placed at points that divide the length of string mathematically .
the strings ' vibrating length is determined when the strings are pressed down behind the frets .
each fret produces a different pitch and each pitch spaced a half-step apart on the *num* tone scale .
the ratio of the widths of two consecutive frets is the twelfth root of two ( formula_1 ) , whose numeric value is about *num* .
*num* .
the twelfth fret divides the string in two exact halves and the *ord* fret ( if present ) divides the string in half yet again .
every twelve frets represents one octave .
this arrangement of frets results in equal tempered tuning .
a classical guitar's frets , fretboard , tuners , headstock , all attached to a long wooden extension , collectively constitute its neck .
the wood for the fretboard usually differs from the wood in the rest of the neck .
the bending stress on the neck is considerable , particularly when heavier gauge strings are used .
this is the point where the neck meets the body .
in the traditional spanish neck joint the neck and block are one piece with the sides inserted into slots cut in the block .
other necks are built separately and joined to the body either with a dovetail joint , mortise or flush joint .
these joints are usually glued and can be reinforced with mechanical fasteners .
recently many manufacturers use bolt on fasteners .
bolt on neck joints were once associated only with less expensive instruments but now some top manufacturers and hand builders are using variations of this method .
some people believed that the spanish style one piece neck / block and glued dovetail necks have better sustain , but testing has failed to confirm this .
while most traditional spanish style builders use the one piece neck / heel block , fleta , a prominent spanish builder , used a dovetail joint due to the influence of his early training in violin making .
one reason for the introduction of the mechanical joints was to make it easier to repair necks .
this is more of a problem with steel string guitars than with nylon strings , which have about half the string tension .
this is why nylon string guitars often don't include a truss rod either .
the body of the instrument is a major determinant of the overall sound variety for acoustic guitars .
the guitar top , or soundboard , is a finely crafted and engineered element often made of spruce , red cedar , redwood or mahogany .
this thin ( often *num* or *num* mm thick ) piece of wood , strengthened by different types of internal bracing , is considered the most prominent factor in determining the sound quality of a guitar .
the majority of the sound is caused by vibration of the guitar top as the energy of the vibrating strings is transferred to it .
different patterns of wood bracing have been used through the years by luthiers ( torres , hauser , ramírez , fleta , and c .
f .
martin being among the most influential designers of their times ) ; to not only strengthen the top against collapsing under the tremendous stress exerted by the tensioned strings , but also to affect the resonation of the top .
some contemporary guitar makers have introduced new construction concepts such as " double-top " consisting of two extra-thin wooden plates separated by nomex , or carbon-fiber reinforced lattice – pattern bracing .
the back and sides are made out of a variety of woods such as mahogany , maple , cypress indian rosewood and highly regarded brazilian rosewood ( " dalbergia nigra " ) .
each one is chosen for its aesthetic effect and structural strength , and such choice can also play a significant role in determining the instrument's timbre .
these are also strengthened with internal bracing , and decorated with inlays and purfling .
the body of a classical guitar is a resonating chamber that projects the vibrations of the body through a " sound hole " , allowing the acoustic guitar to be heard without amplification .
the sound hole is normally a single round hole in the top of the guitar ( under the strings ) , though some have different placement , shapes , or numbers of holes .
how much air an instrument can move determines its maximum volume .
the top , back and sides of a classical guitar body are very thin , so a flexible piece of wood called " kerfing " ( because it is often scored , or " kerfed " so it bends with the shape of the rim ) is glued into the corners where the rim meets the top and back .
this interior reinforcement provides *num* to *num* mm of solid gluing area for these corner joints .
during final construction , a small section of the outside corners is carved or routed out and filled with binding material on the outside corners and decorative strips of material next to the binding , which are called " purfling " .
this binding serves to seal off the endgrain of the top and back .
binding and purfling materials are generally made of either wood or high quality plastic materials .
the main purpose of the bridge on a classical guitar is to transfer the vibration from the strings to the soundboard , which vibrates the air inside of the guitar , thereby amplifying the sound produced by the strings .
the bridge holds the strings in place on the body .
also , the position of the saddle , usually a strip of bone or plastic that supports the strings off the bridge , determines the distance to the nut ( at the top of the fingerboard ) .
the modern full size classical guitar has a scale length of around , with an overall instrument length of .
the scale length has remained quite consistent since it was chosen by the originator of the instrument , antonio de torres .
this length may have been chosen because it's twice the length of a violin string .
as the guitar is tuned to one octave below that of the violin , the same size gut could be used for the first strings of both instruments .
smaller-scale instruments are produced to assist children in learning the instrument as the smaller scale leads to the frets being closer together , making it easier for smaller hands .
the scale-size for the smaller guitars is usually in the range , with an instrument length of .
full-size instruments are sometimes referred to as *num* / *num* , while the smaller sizes are *num* / *num* , *num* / *num* or *num* / *num* .
these sizes are not absolute , as luthiers may choose variations around these nominal scale-lengths ; guitars can be described in size from largest to smallest as : – contra or octave bass ; – bass baritone or quint bass ; – prime or quart bass ; – terz treble ; – alto requinto ; – quart ; – quint ; – soprano , octave or piccolo .
a variety of different tunings are used .
the most common by far , which one could call the " standard tuning " is : the above order , is the tuning from the " *ord* string " ( highest-pitched string e'—spatially the bottom string in playing position ) to the " *ord* string " – lowest-pitched string e—spatially the upper string in playing position , and hence comfortable to pluck with the thumb .
the explanation for this " asymmetrical " tuning ( in the sense that the maj *ord* is not between the two middle strings as say in the tuning of the viola da gamba ) is probably that the guitar originated as a 4-string instrument ( actually an instrument with *num* double courses of strings , see above ) with a maj *ord* between the *ord* and *ord* strings and that it only became a 6-string instrument by gradual addition of a *ord* string and then a *ord* string tuned a *ord* apart : "the development of the modern tuning can be traced in stages .
one of the tunings from the *ord* century is c-f-a-d .
this is equivalent to the top four strings of the modern guitar tuned a tone lower .
however , the absolute pitch for these notes is not equivalent to modern " concert pitch " .
the tuning of the four-course guitar was moved up by a tone and toward the end of the *ord* century , five-course instruments were in use with an added lower string tuned to a .
this produced a-d-g-b-e , one of a wide number of variant tunings of the period .
the low e string was added during the *ord* century .
" this tuning is such that neighboring strings are at most *num* semitones apart .
there are also a variety of commonly used alternate tunings .
context-sensitive grammar a context-sensitive grammar ( csg ) is a formal grammar in which the left-hand sides and right-hand sides of any production rules may be surrounded by a context of terminal and nonterminal symbols .
context-sensitive grammars are more general than context-free grammars , in the sense that there are languages that can be described by csg but not by context-free grammars .
context-sensitive grammars are less general ( in the same sense ) than unrestricted grammars .
thus , csg are positioned between context-free and unrestricted grammars in the chomsky hierarchy .
a formal language that can be described by a context-sensitive grammar , or , equivalently , by a noncontracting grammar or a linear bounded automaton , is called a context-sensitive language .
some textbooks actually define csgs as non-contracting , although this is not how noam chomsky defined them in *num* .
this choice of definition makes no difference in terms of the languages generated ( i .
e .
the two definitions are weakly equivalent ) , but it does make a difference in terms of what grammars are structurally considered context-sensitive ; the latter issue was analyzed by chomsky in *num* .
chomsky introduced context-sensitive grammars as a way to describe the syntax of natural language where it is often the case that a word may or may not be appropriate in a certain place depending on the context .
walter savitch has criticized the terminology " context-sensitive " as misleading and proposed " non-erasing " as better explaining the distinction between a csg and an unrestricted grammar .
although it is well-known that certain features of languages ( e .
g .
cross-serial dependency ) are not context-free , it is an open question how much of csg's expressive power is needed to capture the context sensitivity found in natural languages .
subsequent research in this area has focused on the more computationally tractable mildly context-sensitive languages .
the syntaxes of some visual programming languages can be described by context-sensitive graph grammars .
a formal grammar " g " = ( " n " , σ , " p " , " s " ) , where " n " is a set of nonterminal symbols , σ is a set of terminal symbols , " p " is a set of production rules , and " s " is the start symbol , is context-sensitive if all rules in " p " are of the form where " a " ∈ " n " , α , β ∈ ( " n"∪σ ) and γ ∈ ( " n"∪σ ) .
a string " u " ∈ ( " n"∪σ ) directly yields , or directly derives to , a string " v " ∈ ( " n"∪σ ) , denoted as " u " ⇒ " v " , if " u " can be written as " l"α"a"β"r " , and " v " can be written as " l"αγβ"r " , for some production rule ( α"a"β→αγβ ) ∈ " p " , and some context strings " l " , " r " ∈ ( " n"∪σ ) .
more generally , " u " is said to yield , or derive to , " v " , denoted as " u " ⇒ " v " , if " u " = " u " ⇒ .
.
.
⇒ " u " = " v " for some " n"≥0 and some strings " u " , .
.
.
, " u " ( " n"∪σ ) .
that is , the relation ( ⇒ ) is the reflexive transitive closure of the relation ( ⇒ ) .
the language of the grammar " g " is the set of all terminal symbol strings derivable from its start symbol , formally : " l " ( " g " ) = { " w " ∈ σ : " s " ⇒ " w " } .
derivations that do not end in a string composed of terminal symbols only are possible , but don't contribute to " l " ( " g " ) .
the only difference between this definition of chomsky and that of unrestricted grammars is that γ can be empty in the unrestricted case .
some definitions of a context-sensitive grammar only require that for any production rule of the form u → v , the length of u shall be less than or equal to the length of v .
this seemingly weaker requirement is in fact weakly equivalent , see noncontracting grammar#transforming into context-sensitive grammar .
in addition , a rule of the form where λ represents the empty string and " s " does not appear on the right-hand side of any rule is permitted .
the addition of the empty string allows the statement that the context sensitive languages are a proper superset of the context-free languages , rather than having to make the weaker statement that all context-free grammars with no →λ productions are also context sensitive grammars .
the name " context-sensitive " is explained by the α and β that form the context of " a " and determine whether " a " can be replaced with γ or not .
this is different from a context-free grammar where the context of a nonterminal is not taken into consideration .
indeed , every production of a context-free grammar is of the form " v " → " w " where " v " is a " single " nonterminal symbol , and " w " is a string of terminals and / or nonterminals ; " w " can be empty .
if the possibility of adding the empty string to a language is added to the strings recognized by the noncontracting grammars ( which can never include the empty string ) then the languages in these two definitions are identical .
the left-context- and right-context-sensitive grammars are defined by restricting the rules to just the form α"a " → αγ and to just " a"β → γβ , respectively .
the languages generated by these grammars are also the full class of context-sensitive languages .
the equivalence was established by penttonen normal form .
the following grammar , with start symbol " s " , generates the canonical non-context-free language { " a""b""c " : " n " ≥ *num* } : rules *num* and *num* allow for blowing-up " s " to " a""bc " ( " bc " ) ; rules *num* to *num* allow for successively exchanging each " cb " to " bc " ( four rules are needed for that since a rule " cb " → " bc " wouldn't fit into the scheme α"a"β → αγβ ) ; rules 7–10 allow replacing a non-terminals " b " and " c " with its corresponding terminals " b " and " c " respectively , provided it is in the right place .
a generation chain for is : more complicated grammars formula_1can be used to parse { " a""b""c""d " : " n " ≥ *num* } , and other languages with even more letters .
here we show a simpler approach using non-contracting grammars : start with a kernel of regular productions generating the sentential forms formula_2 and then include the non contracting productions formula_3 , formula_4 , formula_5 , formula_6 , formula_7 , formula_8 , formula_9 , formula_10 , formula_11 , formula_12 .
a non contracting grammar ( for which there is an equivalent formula_1 ) for the language formula_14 is defined by formula_15 and formula_16 , formula_17 , formula_18 , formula_19 , formula_20 , formula_21 , formula_22 .
with these definitions , a derivation for formula_23 is : formula_24 .
a noncontracting grammar for the language { " a " : i ≥ *num* } is constructed in example *num* .
*num* ( p .
*num* ) of ( hopcroft , ullman , *num* ) : every context-sensitive grammar which does not generate the empty string can be transformed into a weakly equivalent one in kuroda normal form .
" weakly equivalent " here means that the two grammars generate the same language .
the normal form will not in general be context-sensitive , but will be a noncontracting grammar .
the kuroda normal form is an actual normal form for non-contracting grammars .
a formal language can be described by a context-sensitive grammar if and only if it is accepted by some linear bounded automaton ( lba ) .
in some textbooks this result is attributed solely to landweber and kuroda .
others call it the myhill-landweber-kuroda theorem .
( myhill introduced the concept of deterministic lba in *num* .
peter s .
landweber published in *num* that the language accepted by a deterministic lba is context sensitive .
kuroda introduced the notion of non-deterministic lba and the equivalence between lba and csgs in *num* .
) context-sensitive languages are closed under complement .
this *num* result is known as the immerman–szelepcsényi theorem .
moreover , they are closed under union , intersection , concatenation , substitution , inverse homomorphism , and kleene plus .
every recursively enumerable language " l " can be written as " h " ( " l " ) for some context-sensitive language " l " and some string homomorphism " h " .
the decision problem that asks whether a certain string " s " belongs to the language of a given context-sensitive grammar " g " , is pspace-complete .
moreover , there are context-sensitive grammars whose languages are pspace-complete .
in other words , there is a context-sensitive grammar " g " such that deciding whether a certain string " s " belongs to the language of " g " is pspace-complete ( so " g " is fixed and only " s " is part of the input of the problem ) .
the emptiness problem for context-sensitive grammars ( given a context-sensitive grammar " g " , is " l " ( " g " ) =∅ ? ) is undecidable .
the luzc parser is a working example of a program which can parse context-sensitive grammars .
savitch has proven the following theoretical result , on which he bases his criticism of csgs as basis for natural language : for any recursively enumerable set " r " , there exists a context-sensitive language / grammar " g " which can be used as a sort of proxy to test membership in " r " in the following way : given a string " s " , " s " is in " r " if and only if there exists a positive integer " n " for which " sc " is in g , where " c " is an arbitrary symbol not part of " r " .
it has been shown that nearly all natural languages may in general be characterized by context-sensitive grammars , but the whole class of csg's seems to be much bigger than natural languages .
worse yet , since the aforementioned decision problem for csg's is pspace-complete , that makes them totally unworkable for practical use , as a polynomial-time algorithm for a pspace-complete problem would imply p=np .
it was proven that some natural languages are not context-free , based on identifying so-called cross-serial dependencies and unbounded scrambling phenomena .
however this does not necessarily imply that all the class csg is necessary to capture " context sensitivity " in the colloquial sense of these terms in natural languages .
for example , the strictly weaker ( than csg ) linear context-free rewriting systems ( lcfrs ) can account for the phenomenon of cross-serial dependencies ; one can write a lcfrs grammar for {"abcd " | " n " ≥ 1} for example .
ongoing research on computational linguistics has focused on formulating other classes of languages that are " mildly context-sensitive " whose decision problems are feasible , such as tree-adjoining grammars , combinatory categorial grammars , coupled context-free languages , and linear context-free rewriting systems .
the languages generated by these formalisms properly lie between the context-free and context-sensitive languages .
more recently , the class ptime has been identified with range concatenation grammars , which are now considered to be the most expressive of the mild-context sensitive languages .
constantine kanaris constantine kanaris or canaris ( ; *num* or 1795september *num* , *num* ) was a greek prime minister , admiral and politician who in his youth was a freedom fighter in the greek war of independence .
he was born and grew up on the island of psara , close to the island of chios , in the aegean .
his exact year of birth is unknown .
the official records of the hellenic navy indicate *num* but modern greek historians believe that *num* is more probable .
constantine was left an orphan at a young age .
having to support himself , he chose to become a seaman like most members of his family since the beginning of the *ord* century .
he was hired as a boy on the brig of his uncle dimitris bourekas .
constantine gained his fame during the greek war of independence ( 1821–1829 ) .
unlike most other prominent figures of the war , he had never been initiated into the filiki eteria ( friendly society ) , which played a significant role in the revolution against the ottoman empire , primarily by secret recruitment of supporters against the empire .
by early *num* , it had gained enough support to declare a revolution .
this declaration seems to have surprised constantine , who was absent at odessa .
he returned to psara in haste and was there when the island joined the revolution on april *num* , *num* .
the island formed its own fleet of ships and the famed seamen of psara , already known for their successful naval combats against pirates and their well-equipped ships , proved to be effective at full naval war .
constantine soon distinguished himself as a fire ship captain .
at chios , on the moonless night of june *num* / june *num* , *num* forces under his command destroyed the flagship of the turkish admiral nasuhzade ali pasha in revenge for the chios massacre .
the admiral was holding a celebration ( bayram ) , so kanaris and his men managed to place a fire ship next to it without being noticed .
when the flagship's powder store caught fire , all men aboard were instantly killed .
the ottoman casualties comprised *num* men , both naval officers and common sailors , as well as kara-ali himself .
later in the year he led another successful attacks against the turkish fleet at tenedos in november *num* .
the turkish fleet captured psara on june *num* , *num* .
a part of the population , including kanaris , managed to flee the island , but those who didn't were either sold into slavery or slaughtered .
after the destruction of his home island , kanaris continued to lead his men into attacks against the turks .
he took part to sea fights in the dodecanese in august *num* .
in august *num* , kanaris led the raid on alexandria , a daring attempt to destroy the egyptian fleet via fire ships that might have been successful if the wind had not failed just after the greek ships entered alexandria harbor .
following the end of the war and the independence of greece , constantine became an officer of the new greek navy , reaching the rank of admiral , and later became a prominent politician .
constantine kanaris was one of the few with the personal confidence of ioannis kapodistrias the first head of state of independent greece .
kanaris served as minister in various governments and then as prime minister , in the provisional government , from march 11-april *num* , *num* .
he served a second term ( october *num* , 1848december *num* , *num* ) , and as navy minister in mavrokordatos ' *num* cabinet .
in *num* , he was one of the few war of independence veterans that helped in the bloodless revolution that deposed king otto of greece and put prince william of denmark on the greek throne as king george i of greece .
under george i , he served as a prime minister for a third term ( march 17april *num* , *num* ) , fourth term ( august *num* , 1864february *num* , *num* ) and fifth and last term ( june 7september *num* , *num* ) .
kanaris died on *num* september *num* whilst still serving in office as prime minister .
following his death his government remained in power until september *num* , *num* without agreeing on a replacement at its head .
he was buried in the first cemetery of athens , where most greek prime ministers and celebrated figures are also buried .
after his death he was honored as a national hero .
to honour kanaris , three ships of the hellenic navy have been named after him ; in *num* , he married despina maniatis , from a historical family of psara .
they had seven children : wilhelm canaris , a german admiral , speculated that he might be a descendant of constantine kanaris .
an official genealogical family history that was researched in *num* showed that he was unrelated and that his family was from italy .

francis scott key francis scott key ( august *num* , 1779january *num* , *num* ) was an american lawyer , author , and amateur poet from frederick , maryland who is best known for writing a poem which later became the lyrics for the united states ' national anthem , " the star-spangled banner " .
during the war of *num* , key observed the british bombardment of fort mchenry in maryland in *num* .
key was inspired upon viewing the american flag still flying over the fort at dawn , and wrote the poem " defence of fort m'henry " , which was published a week later .
the poem was adapted to the tune of the popular song " to anacreon in heaven .
" the song with key's lyrics became known as " the star-spangled banner , " and slowly gained in popularity as an unofficial anthem over the years , finally achieving official status a century later under president woodrow wilson as the united states national anthem .
key was a lawyer in maryland and washington d .
c .
for four decades , and worked on important cases like the burr conspiracy trial , and argued numerous times before the u .
s .
supreme court .
nominated for u .
s .
attorney by president andrew jackson , he served from *num* to *num* .
key owned slaves from *num* , during which time abolitionists ridiculed his words , that america was more like the " land of the free and home of the oppressed " .
he freed his slaves in the 1830s , paying one ex-slave as his farm foreman .
key publicly criticized slavery and gave free legal representation to some slaves seeking freedom , but also represented owners of runaway slaves as well .
representing both slaves and slave owners is emblematic of his complex relationship with slavery .
as district attorney , key suppressed abolitionists and didn't support an immediate end to slavery .
referring to blacks as " a distinct and inferior race of people” , he was a leader of the american colonization society which sent freed slaves back to africa .
key was a devout episcopalian .
he was also an author of poetry , and often wrote on religious themes .
it has been speculated that the u .
s .
motto " in god we trust " was adapted from a line in the fourth stanza of the " star-spangled banner " .
francis scott key's father , john ross key was a lawyer , a commissioned officer in the continental army and a judge .
john was born in frederick , colony of maryland on september *num* , *num* , the son of francis key and ann arnold ross .
francis key's father was english settler philip key ( scott key's great-grandfather ) who resided near leonardtown around *num* , he married susannah gardiner and had seven children .
scott key's mother , ann pheobe dagworthy charlton , was born february *num* , *num* to arthur charlton , a tavern keeper , and his wife , eleanor harrison of frederick , colony of maryland .
her ancestry can be traced back to a henry " henrie " charlton who arrived as a young man aboard the " george " in *num* settling in virginia .
however , very little of this ancestor is known .
francis scott key was born to ann phoebe penn dagworthy ( charlton ) and captain john ross key at the family plantation terra rubra in what was then part of frederick county , now carroll county , maryland .
key graduated from st .
john's college , annapolis , maryland in *num* , and read the law under an uncle , philip barton key who was ( along with his wife ) loyal to the british crown during the war of independence .
he married mary tayloe lloyd on january *num* , *num* .
during the war of *num* , key , accompanied by the british prisoner exchange agent colonel john stuart skinner , dined aboard the british ship hms " tonnant " as the guests of three british officers : vice admiral alexander cochrane , rear admiral george cockburn , and major general robert ross .
skinner and key were there to negotiate the release of prisoners , one of whom was dr .
william beanes , a resident of upper marlboro , maryland , who had been arrested after jailing marauding british troops who were looting local farms .
skinner , key , and beanes were not allowed to return to their own sloop because they had become familiar with the strength and position of the british units and with the british intent to attack baltimore .
thus , key was unable to do anything but watch the bombarding of the american forces at fort mchenry during the battle of baltimore on the night of september *num* , *num* .
at dawn , key was able to see an american flag still waving .
back in baltimore and inspired , key wrote a poem about his experience , " defence of fort m'henry " , which was soon published in william pechin's " american and commercial daily advertiser " on september *num* , *num* .
he took it to thomas carr , a music publisher , who adapted it to the rhythms of composer john stafford smith's " to anacreon in heaven " , a popular tune key had already used as a setting for his 1805-song " when the warrior returns " , celebrating u .
s .
heroes of the first barbary war .
( key used the " star-spangled " flag imagery in the earlier song .
) it has become better known as " the star-spangled banner " .
though somewhat difficult to sing , it became increasingly popular , competing with " hail , columbia " ( *num* ) as the de facto national anthem by the time of the mexican–american war and american civil war .
more than a century after its first publication , the song was adopted as the american national anthem , first by an executive order from president woodrow wilson in1916 ( which had little effect beyond requiring military bands to play what became known as the " service version " ) and then by a congressional resolution in1931 , signed by president herbert hoover .
key was a leading attorney in frederick , maryland , and washington , d .
c .
for many years , with an extensive real estate as well as trial practice .
he and his family settled in georgetown in *num* or *num* , near the new national capital .
there the young key assisted his uncle , the prominent lawyer philip barton key , such as in the sensational conspiracy trial of aaron burr and the expulsion of senator john smith of ohio .
he made the first of his many arguments before the united states supreme court in *num* .
in *num* he assisted president thomas jefferson's attorney general in " united statesv .
peters .
" in *num* , key , a supporter of andrew jackson , assisted in the prosecution of tobias watkins , former u .
s .
treasury auditor under former president john quincy adams for misappropriating public monies .
he also handled the petticoat affair concerning secretary of war john eaton , who had married a widowed saloonkeeper .
in *num* , he served as the attorney for sam houston , then a former u .
s .
representative and governor of tennessee , during his trial for assaulting representative william stanbery of ohio .
president jackson nominated key for united states attorney for the district of columbia in *num* .
after the u .
s .
senate approved the nomination , he served from *num* to *num* , while also handling his own private legal cases .
in *num* , in his most famous case , he prosecuted richard lawrence for his unsuccessful attempt to assassinate president andrew jackson at the entrance doors and top steps of the capitol , the first attempt to kill an american chief executive .
key purchased his first slave in *num* or *num* and owned six slaves in *num* .
mostly in the 1830s , key manumitted ( set free ) seven slaves , one of whom ( clem johnson ) continued to work for him for wages as his farm's foreman , supervising several slaves .
throughout his career key also represented several slaves seeking their freedom in court ( for free ) , as well as several masters seeking return of their runaway slaves .
key , judge william leigh of halifax , and bishop william meade were administrators of the will of their friend john randolph of roanoke , who died without children and left a will directing his executors to free his more than four hundred slaves .
over the next decade , beginning in *num* , the administrators fought to enforce the will and provide the freed slaves land to support themselves .
key publicly criticized slavery's cruelties , so much that after his death a newspaper editorial stated " so actively hostile was he to the peculiar institution that he was called ' the nigger lawyer ' .
.
.
because he often volunteered to defend the downtrodden sons and daughters of africa .
mr .
key convinced me that slavery was wrong—radically wrong .
" in june *num* , key attended the funeral of william costin , a free , mixed race resident who had challenged washington's surety bond laws .
key was a founding member and active leader of the american colonization society and its predecessor , the influential maryland branch , the primary goal of which was to send free african-americans back to africa .
however , he was removed from the board in *num* as its policies shifted toward abolitionism .
key used his position as u .
s .
attorney to suppress abolitionists .
in *num* , he secured a grand jury indictment against benjamin lundy , editor of the anti-slavery publication , the " genius of universal emancipation " , and his printer , william greer , for libel after lundy published an article that declared , " there is neither mercy nor justice for colored people in this district [ of columbia ] " .
lundy's article , key said in the indictment , " was intended to injure , oppress , aggrieve , and vilify the good name , fame , credit & reputation of the magistrates and constables " of washington .
lundy left town rather than face trial ; greer was acquitted .
in august *num* , key agreed to prosecute botanist and doctor reuben crandall , brother of controversial connecticut school teacher prudence crandall , who had recently moved to the national capital .
key secured an indictment for " seditious libel " after two marshals ( who operated as slave catchers in their off hours ) found crandall had a trunk full of anti-slavery publications in his georgetown residence , five days after the snow riot , caused by rumors that a mentally ill slave had attempted to kill an elderly white woman .
in an april *num* trial that attracted nationwide attention , key charged that crandall's actions instigated slaves to rebel .
crandall's attorneys acknowledged he opposed slavery , but denied any intent or actions to encourage rebellion .
key , in his final address to the jury said : the jury acquitted crandall .
this defeat , as well as family tragedies in *num* , diminished key's political ambition .
he resigned as district attorney in *num* .
he remained a staunch proponent of african colonization and a strong critic of the antislavery movement until his death .
key was a devout and prominent episcopalian .
in his youth , he almost became an episcopal priest rather than a lawyer .
throughout his life he sprinkled biblical references in his correspondence .
he was active in all saints parish in frederick , maryland , near his family's home .
he also helped found or financially support several parishes in the new national capital , including st .
john's church in georgetown and christ church in alexandria .
from *num* until his death in *num* , key was associated with the american bible society .
he successfully opposed an abolitionist resolution presented to that group around *num* .
key also helped found two episcopal seminaries , one in baltimore and the other across the potomac river in alexandria , virginia ( the virginia theological seminary ) .
key also published a prose work called " the power of literature , and its connection with religion " in *num* .
the us national motto " in god we trust " was adapted from a phrase in key's " star-spangled banner " , the fourth stanza of which includes the phrase , " and this be our motto : ' in god is our trust' " , leading some to speculate that the phrase was derived from the song .
on january *num* , *num* , key died at the home of his daughter elizabeth howard in baltimore from pleurisy at age *num* .
he was initially interred in old saint paul's cemetery in the vault of john eager howard but in *num* , his body was moved to his family plot in frederick at mount olivet cemetery .
the key monument association erected a memorial in *num* and the remains of both francis scott key and his wife , mary tayloe lloyd , were placed in a crypt in the base of the monument .
despite several efforts to preserve it , the francis scott key residence was ultimately dismantled in1947 .
the residence had been located at 351618mstreet in georgetown .
though key had written poetry from time to time , often with heavily religious themes , these works were not collected and published until 14years after his death .
two of his religious poems used as christian hymns include " before the lord we bow " and " lord , with glowing heart i'd praise thee " .
in1806 , key's sister , anne phoebe charlton key , married roger b .
taney , who would later become chief justice of the united states .
in *num* one daughter , alice , married u .
s .
senator george h .
pendleton and another , ellen lloyd , married simon f .
blunt .
in1859 key's son philip barton key ii was shot and killed by daniel sicklesa u .
s .
representative from new york who would serve as a general in the american civil warafter he discovered that philip barton key was having an affair with his wife .
sickles was acquitted in the first use of the temporary insanity defense .
in1861 key's grandson francis key howard was imprisoned in fort mchenry with the mayor of baltimore george william brown and other locals deemed pro-south .
key was a distant cousin and the namesake of f .
scott fitzgerald , whose full name was francis scott key fitzgerald .
his direct descendants include geneticist thomas hunt morgan , guitarist dana key , and american fashion designer and socialite pauline de rothschild .
blade runner *num* : the edge of human blade runner *num* : the edge of human ( *num* ) is a science fiction novel by american writer k .
w .
jeter .
it is a continuation of both the film " blade runner " and the novel upon which the film was based , philip k .
dick's " do androids dream of electric sheep ? " several months after the events depicted in " blade runner " , deckard has retired to an isolated shack outside the city , taking the replicant rachael with him in a tyrell transport container , which slows down the replicant aging process .
he is approached by a woman who explains she is sarah tyrell , niece of eldon tyrell , heiress to the tyrell corporation and the human template ( " templant " ) for the rachael replicant .
she asks deckard to hunt down the " missing " sixth replicant .
at the same time , the templant for roy batty hires dave holden , the blade runner attacked by leon , to help him hunt down the man he believes is the sixth replicant—deckard .
deckard and holden's investigations lead them to re-visit sebastian , bryant , and john isidore ( from the book " do androids dream of electric sheep ? " ) , learning more about the nature of the blade runners and the replicants .
when deckard , batty , and holden finally clash , batty's super-human fighting prowess leads holden to believe he has been duped all along and that batty is the sixth replicant .
he shoots him .
deckard returns to sarah with his suspicion : there is " no " sixth replicant .
sarah , speaking via a remote camera , confesses that she invented and maintained the rumor herself in order to deliberately discredit and eventually destroy the tyrell corporation because her uncle eldon had based rachel on her and then abandoned the real sarah .
sarah brings rachael back to the corporation to meet with deckard , and they escape .
however , holden , recovering from his injuries during the fight , later uncovers the truth : rachael has been killed by tyrell agents , and the " rachael " who escaped with deckard was actually sarah .
she has completed her revenge by both destroying tyrell and taking back rachael's place .
the book's plot draws from other material related to " blade runner " in a number of ways : however , it also contradicts material in some ways : michael giltz of " entertainment weekly " gave the book a " c- " , feeling that " only hardcore fans will be satisfied by this tale " and saying that jeter's " habit of echoing dialogue and scenes from the film is annoying and begs comparisons he would do well to avoid .
" tal cohen of " tal cohen's bookshelf " called " the edge of human " " a good book " , praising jeter's " further , and deeper , investigation of the questions philip k .
dick originally asked " , but criticized the book for its " needless grandioseness " and for " rel [ ying ] on " blade runner " too heavily , [ as ] the number of new characters introduced is extremely small .
.
.
" ian kaplan of bearcave .
com gave the book three stars out of five , saying that while he was " not entirely satisfied " and felt that the " story tends to be shallow " , " jeter does deal with the moral dilemma of the blade runners who hunt down beings that are virtually human in every way .
" j .
patton of " the bent cover " praised jeter for " [ not ] try [ ing ] to emulate philip k .
dick " , adding , " this book also has all the grittiness and dark edges that the movie showed off so well , along with a very fast pace that will keep you reading into the wee hours of the night .
" in the late 1990s , " edge of human " had been adapted into a screenplay by stuart hazeldine , " blade runner down " , that was to be filmed as the sequel to the *num* film " blade runner " .
ultimately neither this script , nor the jeter novel was used for the eventual sequel , " blade runner *num* " , which uses a different story .
botany botany , also called plant science ( s ) , plant biology or phytology , is the science of plant life and a branch of biology .
a botanist , plant scientist or phytologist is a scientist who specialises in this field .
the term " botany " comes from the ancient greek word ( " botanē " ) meaning " pasture " , " grass " , or " fodder " ; is in turn derived from ( " boskein " ) , " to feed " or " to graze " .
traditionally , botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively , with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the international botanical congress .
nowadays , botanists ( in the strict sense ) study approximately *num* , *num* species of land plants of which some *num* , *num* species are vascular plants ( including approximately *num* , *num* species of flowering plants ) , and approximately *num* , *num* are bryophytes .
botany originated in prehistory as herbalism with the efforts of early humans to identify – and later cultivate – edible , medicinal and poisonous plants , making it one of the oldest branches of science .
medieval physic gardens , often attached to monasteries , contained plants of medical importance .
they were forerunners of the first botanical gardens attached to universities , founded from the 1540s onwards .
one of the earliest was the padua botanical garden .
these gardens facilitated the academic study of plants .
efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of plant taxonomy , and led in *num* to the binomial system of carl linnaeus that remains in use to this day .
in the *ord* and *ord* centuries , new techniques were developed for the study of plants , including methods of optical microscopy and live cell imaging , electron microscopy , analysis of chromosome number , plant chemistry and the structure and function of enzymes and other proteins .
in the last two decades of the *ord* century , botanists exploited the techniques of molecular genetic analysis , including genomics and proteomics and dna sequences to classify plants more accurately .
modern botany is a broad , multidisciplinary subject with inputs from most other areas of science and technology .
research topics include the study of plant structure , growth and differentiation , reproduction , biochemistry and primary metabolism , chemical products , development , diseases , evolutionary relationships , systematics , and plant taxonomy .
dominant themes in *ord* century plant science are molecular genetics and epigenetics , which are the mechanisms and control of gene expression during differentiation of plant cells and tissues .
botanical research has diverse applications in providing staple foods , materials such as timber , oil , rubber , fibre and drugs , in modern horticulture , agriculture and forestry , plant propagation , breeding and genetic modification , in the synthesis of chemicals and raw materials for construction and energy production , in environmental management , and the maintenance of biodiversity .
botany originated as herbalism , the study and use of plants for their medicinal properties .
many records of the holocene period date early botanical knowledge as far back as *num* , *num* years ago .
this early unrecorded knowledge of plants was discovered in ancient sites of human occupation within tennessee , which make up much of the cherokee land today .
the early recorded history of botany includes many ancient writings and plant classifications .
examples of early botanical works have been found in ancient texts from india dating back to before *num* bc , in archaic avestan writings , and in works from china before it was unified in *num* bc .
modern botany traces its roots back to ancient greece specifically to theophrastus ( c .
371–287 bc ) , a student of aristotle who invented and described many of its principles and is widely regarded in the scientific community as the " father of botany " .
his major works , " enquiry into plants " and " on the causes of plants " , constitute the most important contributions to botanical science until the middle ages , almost seventeen centuries later .
another work from ancient greece that made an early impact on botany is " de materia medica " , a five-volume encyclopedia about herbal medicine written in the middle of the first century by greek physician and pharmacologist pedanius dioscorides .
" de materia medica " was widely read for more than *num* , *num* years .
important contributions from the medieval muslim world include ibn wahshiyya's " nabatean agriculture " , abū ḥanīfa dīnawarī's ( 828–896 ) the " book of plants " , and ibn bassal's " the classification of soils " .
in the early *ord* century , abu al-abbas al-nabati , and ibn al-baitar ( d .
*num* ) wrote on botany in a systematic and scientific manner .
in the *ord* century , " botanical gardens " were founded in a number of italian universities – the padua botanical garden in *num* is usually considered to be the first which is still in its original location .
these gardens continued the practical value of earlier " physic gardens " , often associated with monasteries , in which plants were cultivated for medical use .
they supported the growth of botany as an academic subject .
lectures were given about the plants grown in the gardens and their medical uses demonstrated .
botanical gardens came much later to northern europe ; the first in england was the university of oxford botanic garden in *num* .
throughout this period , botany remained firmly subordinate to medicine .
german physician leonhart fuchs ( 1501–1566 ) was one of " the three german fathers of botany " , along with theologian otto brunfels ( 1489–1534 ) and physician hieronymus bock ( 1498–1554 ) ( also called hieronymus tragus ) .
fuchs and brunfels broke away from the tradition of copying earlier works to make original observations of their own .
bock created his own system of plant classification .
physician valerius cordus ( 1515–1544 ) authored a botanically and pharmacologically important herbal " historia plantarum " in *num* and a pharmacopoeia of lasting importance , the " dispensatorium " in *num* .
naturalist conrad von gesner ( 1516–1565 ) and herbalist john gerard ( 1545–c .
*num* ) published herbals covering the medicinal uses of plants .
naturalist ulisse aldrovandi ( 1522–1605 ) was considered the " father of natural history " , which included the study of plants .
in *num* , using an early microscope , polymath robert hooke discovered cells , a term he coined , in cork , and a short time later in living plant tissue .
during the *ord* century , systems of plant identification were developed comparable to dichotomous keys , where unidentified plants are placed into taxonomic groups ( e .
g .
family , genus and species ) by making a series of choices between pairs of characters .
the choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification ( diagnostic keys ) or more closely related to the natural or phyletic order of the taxa in synoptic keys .
by the *ord* century , new plants for study were arriving in europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the european colonies worldwide .
in *num* , carl von linné ( carl linnaeus ) published his species plantarum , a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for modern botanical nomenclature .
this established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the genus and the second identified the species within the genus .
for the purposes of identification , linnaeus's " systema sexuale " classified plants into *num* groups according to the number of their male sexual organs .
the *ord* group , " cryptogamia " , included all plants with concealed reproductive parts , mosses , liverworts , ferns , algae and fungi .
increasing knowledge of plant anatomy , morphology and life cycles led to the realisation that there were more natural affinities between plants than the artificial sexual system of linnaeus .
adanson ( *num* ) , de jussieu ( *num* ) , and candolle ( *num* ) all proposed various alternative natural systems of classification that grouped plants using a wider range of shared characters and were widely followed .
the candollean system reflected his ideas of the progression of morphological complexity and the later classification by bentham and hooker , which was influential until the *ord* century , was influenced by candolle's approach .
darwin's publication of the " origin of species " in *num* and his concept of common descent required modifications to the candollean system to reflect evolutionary relationships as distinct from mere morphological similarity .
botany was greatly stimulated by the appearance of the first " modern " textbook , matthias schleiden's " " , published in english in *num* as " principles of scientific botany " .
schleiden was a microscopist and an early plant anatomist who co-founded the cell theory with theodor schwann and rudolf virchow and was among the first to grasp the significance of the cell nucleus that had been described by robert brown in *num* .
in *num* , adolf fick formulated fick's laws that enabled the calculation of the rates of molecular diffusion in biological systems .
building upon the gene-chromosome theory of heredity that originated with gregor mendel ( 1822–1884 ) , august weismann ( 1834–1914 ) proved that inheritance only takes place through gametes .
no other cells can pass on inherited characters .
the work of katherine esau ( 1898–1997 ) on plant anatomy is still a major foundation of modern botany .
her books " plant anatomy " and " anatomy of seed plants " have been key plant structural biology texts for more than half a century .
the discipline of plant ecology was pioneered in the late *ord* century by botanists such as eugenius warming , who produced the hypothesis that plants form communities , and his mentor and successor christen c .
raunkiær whose system for describing plant life forms is still in use today .
the concept that the composition of plant communities such as temperate broadleaf forest changes by a process of ecological succession was developed by henry chandler cowles , arthur tansley and frederic clements .
clements is credited with the idea of climax vegetation as the most complex vegetation that an environment can support and tansley introduced the concept of ecosystems to biology .
building on the extensive earlier work of alphonse de candolle , nikolai vavilov ( 1887–1943 ) produced accounts of the biogeography , centres of origin , and evolutionary history of economic plants .
particularly since the mid-1960s there have been advances in understanding of the physics of plant physiological processes such as transpiration ( the transport of water within plant tissues ) , the temperature dependence of rates of water evaporation from the leaf surface and the molecular diffusion of water vapour and carbon dioxide through stomatal apertures .
these developments , coupled with new methods for measuring the size of stomatal apertures , and the rate of photosynthesis have enabled precise description of the rates of gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere .
innovations in statistical analysis by ronald fisher , frank yates and others at rothamsted experimental station facilitated rational experimental design and data analysis in botanical research .

thimann in *num* enabled regulation of plant growth by externally applied chemicals .
frederick campion steward pioneered techniques of micropropagation and plant tissue culture controlled by plant hormones .
the synthetic auxin *num* , 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or *num* , 4-d was one of the first commercial synthetic herbicides .
*ord* century developments in plant biochemistry have been driven by modern techniques of organic chemical analysis , such as spectroscopy , chromatography and electrophoresis .
with the rise of the related molecular-scale biological approaches of molecular biology , genomics , proteomics and metabolomics , the relationship between the plant genome and most aspects of the biochemistry , physiology , morphology and behaviour of plants can be subjected to detailed experimental analysis .
the concept originally stated by gottlieb haberlandt in *num* that all plant cells are totipotent and can be grown " in vitro " ultimately enabled the use of genetic engineering experimentally to knock out a gene or genes responsible for a specific trait , or to add genes such as gfp that report when a gene of interest is being expressed .
these technologies enable the biotechnological use of whole plants or plant cell cultures grown in bioreactors to synthesise pesticides , antibiotics or other pharmaceuticals , as well as the practical application of genetically modified crops designed for traits such as improved yield .
modern morphology recognises a continuum between the major morphological categories of root , stem ( caulome ) , leaf ( phyllome ) and trichome .
furthermore , it emphasises structural dynamics .
modern systematics aims to reflect and discover phylogenetic relationships between plants .
modern molecular phylogenetics largely ignores morphological characters , relying on dna sequences as data .
molecular analysis of dna sequences from most families of flowering plants enabled the angiosperm phylogeny group to publish in *num* a phylogeny of flowering plants , answering many of the questions about relationships among angiosperm families and species .
the theoretical possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and commercial varieties by dna barcoding is the subject of active current research .
the study of plants is vital because they underpin almost all animal life on earth by generating a large proportion of the oxygen and food that provide humans and other organisms with aerobic respiration with the chemical energy they need to exist .
plants , algae and cyanobacteria are the major groups of organisms that carry out photosynthesis , a process that uses the energy of sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugars that can be used both as a source of chemical energy and of organic molecules that are used in the structural components of cells .
as a by-product of photosynthesis , plants release oxygen into the atmosphere , a gas that is required by nearly all living things to carry out cellular respiration .
in addition , they are influential in the global carbon and water cycles and plant roots bind and stabilise soils , preventing soil erosion .
plants are crucial to the future of human society as they provide food , oxygen , medicine , and products for people , as well as creating and preserving soil .
historically , all living things were classified as either animals or plants and botany covered the study of all organisms not considered animals .
botanists examine both the internal functions and processes within plant organelles , cells , tissues , whole plants , plant populations and plant communities .
at each of these levels , a botanist may be concerned with the classification ( taxonomy ) , phylogeny and evolution , structure ( anatomy and morphology ) , or function ( physiology ) of plant life .
the strictest definition of " plant " includes only the " land plants " or embryophytes , which include seed plants ( gymnosperms , including the pines , and flowering plants ) and the free-sporing cryptogams including ferns , clubmosses , liverworts , hornworts and mosses .
embryophytes are multicellular eukaryotes descended from an ancestor that obtained its energy from sunlight by photosynthesis .
they have life cycles with alternating haploid and diploid phases .
the sexual haploid phase of embryophytes , known as the gametophyte , nurtures the developing diploid embryo sporophyte within its tissues for at least part of its life , even in the seed plants , where the gametophyte itself is nurtured by its parent sporophyte .
other groups of organisms that were previously studied by botanists include bacteria ( now studied in bacteriology ) , fungi ( mycology ) – including lichen-forming fungi ( lichenology ) , non-chlorophyte algae ( phycology ) , and viruses ( virology ) .
however , attention is still given to these groups by botanists , and fungi ( including lichens ) and photosynthetic protists are usually covered in introductory botany courses .
palaeobotanists study ancient plants in the fossil record to provide information about the evolutionary history of plants .
cyanobacteria , the first oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms on earth , are thought to have given rise to the ancestor of plants by entering into an endosymbiotic relationship with an early eukaryote , ultimately becoming the chloroplasts in plant cells .
the new photosynthetic plants ( along with their algal relatives ) accelerated the rise in atmospheric oxygen started by the cyanobacteria , changing the ancient oxygen-free , reducing , atmosphere to one in which free oxygen has been abundant for more than *num* billion years .
among the important botanical questions of the *ord* century are the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients : energy , carbon , oxygen , nitrogen and water , and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management , conservation , human food security , biologically invasive organisms , carbon sequestration , climate change , and sustainability .
virtually all staple foods come either directly from primary production by plants , or indirectly from animals that eat them .
plants and other photosynthetic organisms are at the base of most food chains because they use the energy from the sun and nutrients from the soil and atmosphere , converting them into a form that can be used by animals .
this is what ecologists call the first trophic level .
the modern forms of the major staple foods , such as hemp , teff , maize , rice , wheat and other cereal grasses , pulses , bananas and plantains , as well as hemp , flax and cotton grown for their fibres , are the outcome of prehistoric selection over thousands of years from among wild ancestral plants with the most desirable characteristics .
botanists study how plants produce food and how to increase yields , for example through plant breeding , making their work important to humanity's ability to feed the world and provide food security for future generations .
botanists also study weeds , which are a considerable problem in agriculture , and the biology and control of plant pathogens in agriculture and natural ecosystems .
ethnobotany is the study of the relationships between plants and people .
when applied to the investigation of historical plant–people relationships ethnobotany may be referred to as archaeobotany or palaeoethnobotany .
some of the earliest plant-people relationships arose between the indigenous people of canada in identifying edible plants from inedible plants .
this relationship the indigenous people had with plants was recorded by ethnobotanists .
plant biochemistry is the study of the chemical processes used by plants .
some of these processes are used in their primary metabolism like the photosynthetic calvin cycle and crassulacean acid metabolism .
others make specialised materials like the cellulose and lignin used to build their bodies , and secondary products like resins and aroma compounds .
plants and various other groups of photosynthetic eukaryotes collectively known as " algae " have unique organelles known as chloroplasts .
chloroplasts are thought to be descended from cyanobacteria that formed endosymbiotic relationships with ancient plant and algal ancestors .
chloroplasts and cyanobacteria contain the blue-green pigment chlorophyll " a " .
chlorophyll " a " ( as well as its plant and green algal-specific cousin chlorophyll " b " ) absorbs light in the blue-violet and orange / red parts of the spectrum while reflecting and transmitting the green light that we see as the characteristic colour of these organisms .
the energy in the red and blue light that these pigments absorb is used by chloroplasts to make energy-rich carbon compounds from carbon dioxide and water by oxygenic photosynthesis , a process that generates molecular oxygen ( o ) as a by-product .
the light energy captured by chlorophyll " a " is initially in the form of electrons ( and later a proton gradient ) that's used to make molecules of atp and nadph which temporarily store and transport energy .
their energy is used in the light-independent reactions of the calvin cycle by the enzyme rubisco to produce molecules of the 3-carbon sugar glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate ( g3p ) .
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is the first product of photosynthesis and the raw material from which glucose and almost all other organic molecules of biological origin are synthesised .
some of the glucose is converted to starch which is stored in the chloroplast .
starch is the characteristic energy store of most land plants and algae , while inulin , a polymer of fructose is used for the same purpose in the sunflower family asteraceae .
some of the glucose is converted to sucrose ( common table sugar ) for export to the rest of the plant .
unlike in animals ( which lack chloroplasts ) , plants and their eukaryote relatives have delegated many biochemical roles to their chloroplasts , including synthesising all their fatty acids , and most amino acids .
the fatty acids that chloroplasts make are used for many things , such as providing material to build cell membranes out of and making the polymer cutin which is found in the plant cuticle that protects land plants from drying out .
plants synthesise a number of unique polymers like the polysaccharide molecules cellulose , pectin and xyloglucan from which the land plant cell wall is constructed .
vascular land plants make lignin , a polymer used to strengthen the secondary cell walls of xylem tracheids and vessels to keep them from collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress .
lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibres that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood .
sporopollenin is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record .
it is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the ordovician period .
the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today is much lower than it was when plants emerged onto land during the ordovician and silurian periods .
many monocots like maize and the pineapple and some dicots like the asteraceae have since independently evolved pathways like crassulacean acid metabolism and the carbon fixation pathway for photosynthesis which avoid the losses resulting from photorespiration in the more common carbon fixation pathway .
these biochemical strategies are unique to land plants .
phytochemistry is a branch of plant biochemistry primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism .
some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock .
others , such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma , as flavourings and spices ( e .
g .
, capsaicin ) , and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies .
many medicinal and recreational drugs , such as tetrahydrocannabinol ( active ingredient in cannabis ) , caffeine , morphine and nicotine come directly from plants .
others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products .
for example , the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid , originally isolated from the bark of willow trees , and a wide range of opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy .
popular stimulants come from plants , such as caffeine from coffee , tea and chocolate , and nicotine from tobacco .
most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley ( beer ) , rice ( sake ) and grapes ( wine ) .
native americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years .
this knowledge native americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery .
plants can synthesise useful coloured dyes and pigments such as the anthocyanins responsible for the red colour of red wine , yellow weld and blue woad used together to produce lincoln green , indoxyl , source of the blue dye indigo traditionally used to dye denim and the artist's pigments gamboge and rose madder .
sugar , starch , cotton , linen , hemp , some types of rope , wood and particle boards , papyrus and paper , vegetable oils , wax , and natural rubber are examples of commercially important materials made from plant tissues or their secondary products .
charcoal , a pure form of carbon made by pyrolysis of wood , has a long history as a metal-smelting fuel , as a filter material and adsorbent and as an artist's material and is one of the three ingredients of gunpowder .
cellulose , the world's most abundant organic polymer , can be converted into energy , fuels , materials and chemical feedstock .
products made from cellulose include rayon and cellophane , wallpaper paste , biobutanol and gun cotton .
sugarcane , rapeseed and soy are some of the plants with a highly fermentable sugar or oil content that are used as sources of biofuels , important alternatives to fossil fuels , such as biodiesel .
sweetgrass was used by native americans to ward off bugs like mosquitoes .
these bug repelling properties of sweetgrass were later found by the american chemical society in the molecules phytol and coumarin .
plant ecology is the science of the functional relationships between plants and their habitats – the environments where they complete their life cycles .
plant ecologists study the composition of local and regional floras , their biodiversity , genetic diversity and fitness , the adaptation of plants to their environment , and their competitive or mutualistic interactions with other species .
some ecologists even rely on empirical data from indigenous people that is gathered by ethnobotanists .
this information can relay a great deal of information on how the land once was thousands of years ago and how it has changed over that time .
the goals of plant ecology are to understand the causes of their distribution patterns , productivity , environmental impact , evolution , and responses to environmental change .
plants depend on certain edaphic ( soil ) and climatic factors in their environment but can modify these factors too .
for example , they can change their environment's albedo , increase runoff interception , stabilise mineral soils and develop their organic content , and affect local temperature .
plants compete with other organisms in their ecosystem for resources .
they interact with their neighbours at a variety of spatial scales in groups , populations and communities that collectively constitute vegetation .
regions with characteristic vegetation types and dominant plants as well as similar abiotic and biotic factors , climate , and geography make up biomes like tundra or tropical rainforest .
herbivores eat plants , but plants can defend themselves and some species are parasitic or even carnivorous .
other organisms form mutually beneficial relationships with plants .
for example , mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia provide plants with nutrients in exchange for food , ants are recruited by ant plants to provide protection , honey bees , bats and other animals pollinate flowers and humans and other animals act as dispersal vectors to spread spores and seeds .
plant responses to climate and other environmental changes can inform our understanding of how these changes affect ecosystem function and productivity .
for example , plant phenology can be a useful proxy for temperature in historical climatology , and the biological impact of climate change and global warming .
palynology , the analysis of fossil pollen deposits in sediments from thousands or millions of years ago allows the reconstruction of past climates .
estimates of atmospheric concentrations since the palaeozoic have been obtained from stomatal densities and the leaf shapes and sizes of ancient land plants .
ozone depletion can expose plants to higher levels of ultraviolet radiation-b ( uv-b ) , resulting in lower growth rates .
moreover , information from studies of community ecology , plant systematics , and taxonomy is essential to understanding vegetation change , habitat destruction and species extinction .
inheritance in plants follows the same fundamental principles of genetics as in other multicellular organisms .
gregor mendel discovered the genetic laws of inheritance by studying inherited traits such as shape in " pisum sativum " ( peas ) .
what mendel learned from studying plants has had far reaching benefits outside of botany .
similarly , " jumping genes " were discovered by barbara mcclintock while she was studying maize .
nevertheless , there are some distinctive genetic differences between plants and other organisms .
species boundaries in plants may be weaker than in animals , and cross species hybrids are often possible .
a familiar example is peppermint , " mentha " × " piperita " , a sterile hybrid between " mentha aquatica " and spearmint , " mentha spicata " .
the many cultivated varieties of wheat are the result of multiple inter- and intra-specific crosses between wild species and their hybrids .
angiosperms with monoecious flowers often have self-incompatibility mechanisms that operate between the pollen and stigma so that the pollen either fails to reach the stigma or fails to germinate and produce male gametes .
this is one of several methods used by plants to promote outcrossing .
in many land plants the male and female gametes are produced by separate individuals .
these species are said to be dioecious when referring to vascular plant sporophytes and dioicous when referring to bryophyte gametophytes .
unlike in higher animals , where parthenogenesis is rare , asexual reproduction may occur in plants by several different mechanisms .
the formation of stem tubers in potato is one example .
particularly in arctic or alpine habitats , where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers by animals are rare , plantlets or bulbs , may develop instead of flowers , replacing sexual reproduction with asexual reproduction and giving rise to clonal populations genetically identical to the parent .
this is one of several types of apomixis that occur in plants .
apomixis can also happen in a seed , producing a seed that contains an embryo genetically identical to the parent .
most sexually reproducing organisms are diploid , with paired chromosomes , but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in cytokinesis .
this can occur early in development to produce an autopolyploid or partly autopolyploid organism , or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid ( endopolyploidy ) , or during gamete formation .
an allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species .
both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally , but may be unable to cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers .
these plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area , may be sufficiently successful to form a new species .
some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce vegetatively or by seed apomixis , forming clonal populations of identical individuals .
durum wheat is a fertile tetraploid allopolyploid , while bread wheat is a fertile hexaploid .
the commercial banana is an example of a sterile , seedless triploid hybrid .
common dandelion is a triploid that produces viable seeds by apomictic seed .
as in other eukaryotes , the inheritance of endosymbiotic organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts in plants is non-mendelian .
chloroplasts are inherited through the male parent in gymnosperms but often through the female parent in flowering plants .
a considerable amount of new knowledge about plant function comes from studies of the molecular genetics of model plants such as the thale cress , " arabidopsis thaliana " , a weedy species in the mustard family ( brassicaceae ) .
the genome or hereditary information contained in the genes of this species is encoded by about *num* million base pairs of dna , forming one of the smallest genomes among flowering plants .
" arabidopsis " was the first plant to have its genome sequenced , in *num* .
the sequencing of some other relatively small genomes , of rice ( " oryza sativa " ) and " brachypodium distachyon " , has made them important model species for understanding the genetics , cellular and molecular biology of cereals , grasses and monocots generally .
model plants such as " arabidopsis thaliana " are used for studying the molecular biology of plant cells and the chloroplast .
ideally , these organisms have small genomes that are well known or completely sequenced , small stature and short generation times .
corn has been used to study mechanisms of photosynthesis and phloem loading of sugar in plants .
the single celled green alga " chlamydomonas reinhardtii " , while not an embryophyte itself , contains a green-pigmented chloroplast related to that of land plants , making it useful for study .
a red alga " cyanidioschyzon merolae " has also been used to study some basic chloroplast functions .
spinach , peas , soybeans and a moss " physcomitrella patens " are commonly used to study plant cell biology .
"agrobacterium tumefaciens " , a soil rhizosphere bacterium , can attach to plant cells and infect them with a callus-inducing ti plasmid by horizontal gene transfer , causing a callus infection called crown gall disease .
schell and van montagu ( *num* ) hypothesised that the ti plasmid could be a natural vector for introducing the nif gene responsible for nitrogen fixation in the root nodules of legumes and other plant species .
today , genetic modification of the ti plasmid is one of the main techniques for introduction of transgenes to plants and the creation of genetically modified crops .
epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in the underlying dna sequence but cause the organism's genes to behave ( or " express themselves " ) differently .
one example of epigenetic change is the marking of the genes by dna methylation which determines whether they will be expressed or not .
gene expression can also be controlled by repressor proteins that attach to silencer regions of the dna and prevent that region of the dna code from being expressed .
epigenetic marks may be added or removed from the dna during programmed stages of development of the plant , and are responsible , for example , for the differences between anthers , petals and normal leaves , despite the fact that they all have the same underlying genetic code .
epigenetic changes may be temporary or may remain through successive cell divisions for the remainder of the cell's life .
some epigenetic changes have been shown to be heritable , while others are reset in the germ cells .
epigenetic changes in eukaryotic biology serve to regulate the process of cellular differentiation .
during morphogenesis , totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo , which in turn become fully differentiated cells .
a single fertilised egg cell , the zygote , gives rise to the many different plant cell types including parenchyma , xylem vessel elements , phloem sieve tubes , guard cells of the epidermis , etc .
as it continues to divide .
the process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others .
unlike animals , many plant cells , particularly those of the parenchyma , do not terminally differentiate , remaining totipotent with the ability to give rise to a new individual plant .
exceptions include highly lignified cells , the sclerenchyma and xylem which are dead at maturity , and the phloem sieve tubes which lack nuclei .
while plants use many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals , such as chromatin remodelling , an alternative hypothesis is that plants set their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their developmental fate .
the chloroplasts of plants have a number of biochemical , structural and genetic similarities to cyanobacteria , ( commonly but incorrectly known as " blue-green algae " ) and are thought to be derived from an ancient endosymbiotic relationship between an ancestral eukaryotic cell and a cyanobacterial resident .
the algae are a polyphyletic group and are placed in various divisions , some more closely related to plants than others .
there are many differences between them in features such as cell wall composition , biochemistry , pigmentation , chloroplast structure and nutrient reserves .
the algal division charophyta , sister to the green algal division chlorophyta , is considered to contain the ancestor of true plants .
the charophyte class charophyceae and the land plant sub-kingdom embryophyta together form the monophyletic group or clade streptophytina .
nonvascular land plants are embryophytes that lack the vascular tissues xylem and phloem .
they include mosses , liverworts and hornworts .
pteridophytic vascular plants with true xylem and phloem that reproduced by spores germinating into free-living gametophytes evolved during the silurian period and diversified into several lineages during the late silurian and early devonian .
representatives of the lycopods have survived to the present day .
by the end of the devonian period , several groups , including the lycopods , sphenophylls and progymnosperms , had independently evolved " megaspory " – their spores were of two distinct sizes , larger megaspores and smaller microspores .
their reduced gametophytes developed from megaspores retained within the spore-producing organs ( megasporangia ) of the sporophyte , a condition known as endospory .
seeds consist of an endosporic megasporangium surrounded by one or two sheathing layers ( integuments ) .
the young sporophyte develops within the seed , which on germination splits to release it .
the earliest known seed plants date from the latest devonian famennian stage .
following the evolution of the seed habit , seed plants diversified , giving rise to a number of now-extinct groups , including seed ferns , as well as the modern gymnosperms and angiosperms .
gymnosperms produce " naked seeds " not fully enclosed in an ovary ; modern representatives include conifers , cycads , " ginkgo " , and gnetales .
angiosperms produce seeds enclosed in a structure such as a carpel or an ovary .
ongoing research on the molecular phylogenetics of living plants appears to show that the angiosperms are a sister clade to the gymnosperms .
plant physiology encompasses all the internal chemical and physical activities of plants associated with life .
chemicals obtained from the air , soil and water form the basis of all plant metabolism .
the energy of sunlight , captured by oxygenic photosynthesis and released by cellular respiration , is the basis of almost all life .
photoautotrophs , including all green plants , algae and cyanobacteria gather energy directly from sunlight by photosynthesis .
heterotrophs including all animals , all fungi , all completely parasitic plants , and non-photosynthetic bacteria take in organic molecules produced by photoautotrophs and respire them or use them in the construction of cells and tissues .
respiration is the oxidation of carbon compounds by breaking them down into simpler structures to release the energy they contain , essentially the opposite of photosynthesis .
molecules are moved within plants by transport processes that operate at a variety of spatial scales .
subcellular transport of ions , electrons and molecules such as water and enzymes occurs across cell membranes .
minerals and water are transported from roots to other parts of the plant in the transpiration stream .
diffusion , osmosis , and active transport and mass flow are all different ways transport can occur .
examples of elements that plants need to transport are nitrogen , phosphorus , potassium , calcium , magnesium , and sulfur .
in vascular plants , these elements are extracted from the soil as soluble ions by the roots and transported throughout the plant in the xylem .
most of the elements required for plant nutrition come from the chemical breakdown of soil minerals .
sucrose produced by photosynthesis is transported from the leaves to other parts of the plant in the phloem and plant hormones are transported by a variety of processes .
plants are not passive , but respond to external signals such as light , touch , and injury by moving or growing towards or away from the stimulus , as appropriate .
tangible evidence of touch sensitivity is the almost instantaneous collapse of leaflets of " mimosa pudica " , the insect traps of venus flytrap and bladderworts , and the pollinia of orchids .
the hypothesis that plant growth and development is coordinated by plant hormones or plant growth regulators first emerged in the late *ord* century .
darwin experimented on the movements of plant shoots and roots towards light and gravity , and concluded " it is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle .
.
acts like the brain of one of the lower animals .
.
directing the several movements " .
about the same time , the role of auxins ( from the greek auxein , to grow ) in control of plant growth was first outlined by the dutch scientist frits went .
the first known auxin , indole-3-acetic acid ( iaa ) , which promotes cell growth , was only isolated from plants about *num* years later .
this compound mediates the tropic responses of shoots and roots towards light and gravity .
the finding in *num* that plant callus could be maintained in culture containing iaa , followed by the observation in *num* that it could be induced to form roots and shoots by controlling the concentration of growth hormones were key steps in the development of plant biotechnology and genetic modification .
cytokinins are a class of plant hormones named for their control of cell division or cytokinesis .
the natural cytokinin zeatin was discovered in corn , " zea mays " , and is a derivative of the purine adenine .
zeatin is produced in roots and transported to shoots in the xylem where it promotes cell division , bud development , and the greening of chloroplasts .
the gibberelins , such as gibberelic acid are diterpenes synthesised from acetyl coa via the mevalonate pathway .
they are involved in the promotion of germination and dormancy-breaking in seeds , in regulation of plant height by controlling stem elongation and the control of flowering .
abscisic acid ( aba ) occurs in all land plants except liverworts , and is synthesised from carotenoids in the chloroplasts and other plastids .
it inhibits cell division , promotes seed maturation , and dormancy , and promotes stomatal closure .
it was so named because it was originally thought to control abscission .
ethylene is a gaseous hormone that is produced in all higher plant tissues from methionine .
it is now known to be the hormone that stimulates or regulates fruit ripening and abscission , and it , or the synthetic growth regulator ethephon which is rapidly metabolised to produce ethylene , are used on industrial scale to promote ripening of cotton , pineapples and other climacteric crops .
another class of phytohormones is the jasmonates , first isolated from the oil of " jasminum grandiflorum " which regulates wound responses in plants by unblocking the expression of genes required in the systemic acquired resistance response to pathogen attack .
in addition to being the primary energy source for plants , light functions as a signalling device , providing information to the plant , such as how much sunlight the plant receives each day .
this can result in adaptive changes in a process known as photomorphogenesis .
phytochromes are the photoreceptors in a plant that are sensitive to light .
plant anatomy is the study of the structure of plant cells and tissues , whereas plant morphology is the study of their external form .
all plants are multicellular eukaryotes , their dna stored in nuclei .
the characteristic features of plant cells that distinguish them from those of animals and fungi include a primary cell wall composed of the polysaccharides cellulose , hemicellulose and pectin , larger vacuoles than in animal cells and the presence of plastids with unique photosynthetic and biosynthetic functions as in the chloroplasts .
other plastids contain storage products such as starch ( amyloplasts ) or lipids ( elaioplasts ) .
uniquely , streptophyte cells and those of the green algal order trentepohliales divide by construction of a phragmoplast as a template for building a cell plate late in cell division .
the bodies of vascular plants including clubmosses , ferns and seed plants ( gymnosperms and angiosperms ) generally have aerial and subterranean subsystems .
the shoots consist of stems bearing green photosynthesising leaves and reproductive structures .
the underground vascularised roots bear root hairs at their tips and generally lack chlorophyll .
non-vascular plants , the liverworts , hornworts and mosses do not produce ground-penetrating vascular roots and most of the plant participates in photosynthesis .
the sporophyte generation is nonphotosynthetic in liverworts but may be able to contribute part of its energy needs by photosynthesis in mosses and hornworts .
the root system and the shoot system are interdependent – the usually nonphotosynthetic root system depends on the shoot system for food , and the usually photosynthetic shoot system depends on water and minerals from the root system .
cells in each system are capable of creating cells of the other and producing adventitious shoots or roots .
stolons and tubers are examples of shoots that can grow roots .
roots that spread out close to the surface , such as those of willows , can produce shoots and ultimately new plants .
in the event that one of the systems is lost , the other can often regrow it .
in fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf , as is the case with " saintpaulia " , or even a single cell – which can dedifferentiate into a callus ( a mass of unspecialised cells ) that can grow into a new plant .
in vascular plants , the xylem and phloem are the conductive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots .
roots are often adapted to store food such as sugars or starch , as in sugar beets and carrots .
stems mainly provide support to the leaves and reproductive structures , but can store water in succulent plants such as cacti , food as in potato tubers , or reproduce vegetatively as in the stolons of strawberry plants or in the process of layering .
leaves gather sunlight and carry out photosynthesis .
large , flat , flexible , green leaves are called foliage leaves .
gymnosperms , such as conifers , cycads , " ginkgo " , and gnetophytes are seed-producing plants with open seeds .
angiosperms are seed-producing plants that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds .
woody plants , such as azaleas and oaks , undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional types of tissues : wood ( secondary xylem ) and bark ( secondary phloem and cork ) .
all gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants .
some plants reproduce sexually , some asexually , and some via both means .
although reference to major morphological categories such as root , stem , leaf , and trichome are useful , one has to keep in mind that these categories are linked through intermediate forms so that a continuum between the categories results .
furthermore , structures can be seen as processes , that is , process combinations .
systematic botany is part of systematic biology , which is concerned with the range and diversity of organisms and their relationships , particularly as determined by their evolutionary history .
it involves , or is related to , biological classification , scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics .
biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species .
biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy .
modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of carl linnaeus , who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics .
these groupings have since been revised to align better with the darwinian principle of common descent – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics .
while scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms , molecular phylogenetics , which uses dna sequences as data , has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so .
the dominant classification system is called linnaean taxonomy .
it includes ranks and binomial nomenclature .
the nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the international code of nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants ( icn ) and administered by the international botanical congress .
kingdom plantae belongs to domain eukarya and is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified .
the order is : kingdom ; phylum ( or division ) ; class ; order ; family ; genus ( plural " genera " ) ; species .
the scientific name of a plant represents its genus and its species within the genus , resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism .
for example , the tiger lily is " lilium columbianum " .
" lilium " is the genus , and " columbianum " the specific epithet .
the combination is the name of the species .
when writing the scientific name of an organism , it is proper to capitalise the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase .
additionally , the entire term is ordinarily italicised ( or underlined when italics are not available ) .
the evolutionary relationships and heredity of a group of organisms is called its phylogeny .
phylogenetic studies attempt to discover phylogenies .
the basic approach is to use similarities based on shared inheritance to determine relationships .
as an example , species of " pereskia " are trees or bushes with prominent leaves .
they do not obviously resemble a typical leafless cactus such as an " echinocactus " .
however , both " pereskia " and " echinocactus " have spines produced from areoles ( highly specialised pad-like structures ) suggesting that the two genera are indeed related .
judging relationships based on shared characters requires care , since plants may resemble one another through convergent evolution in which characters have arisen independently .
some euphorbias have leafless , rounded bodies adapted to water conservation similar to those of globular cacti , but characters such as the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not closely related .
the cladistic method takes a systematic approach to characters , distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history – such as those evolved separately in different groups ( homoplasies ) or those left over from ancestors ( plesiomorphies ) – and derived characters , which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor ( apomorphies ) .
only derived characters , such as the spine-producing areoles of cacti , provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor .
the results of cladistic analyses are expressed as cladograms : tree-like diagrams showing the pattern of evolutionary branching and descent .
from the 1990s onwards , the predominant approach to constructing phylogenies for living plants has been molecular phylogenetics , which uses molecular characters , particularly dna sequences , rather than morphological characters like the presence or absence of spines and areoles .
the difference is that the genetic code itself is used to decide evolutionary relationships , instead of being used indirectly via the characters it gives rise to .
clive stace describes this as having " direct access to the genetic basis of evolution .
" as a simple example , prior to the use of genetic evidence , fungi were thought either to be plants or to be more closely related to plants than animals .
genetic evidence suggests that the true evolutionary relationship of multicelled organisms is as shown in the cladogram below – fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants .
in *num* , the angiosperm phylogeny group published a phylogeny for flowering plants based on an analysis of dna sequences from most families of flowering plants .
as a result of this work , many questions , such as which families represent the earliest branches of angiosperms , have now been answered .
investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants .
despite the study of model plants and increasing use of dna evidence , there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various taxa .
technological developments such as computers and electron microscopes have greatly increased the level of detail studied and speed at which data can be analysed .
data warehouse in computing , a data warehouse ( dw or dwh ) , also known as an enterprise data warehouse ( edw ) , is a system used for reporting and data analysis , and is considered a core component of business intelligence .
dws are central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources .
they store current and historical data in one single place that are used for creating analytical reports for workers throughout the enterprise .
the data stored in the warehouse is uploaded from the operational systems ( such as marketing or sales ) .
the data may pass through an operational data store and may require data cleansing for additional operations to ensure data quality before it is used in the dw for reporting .
the typical extract , transform , load ( etl ) -based data warehouse uses staging , data integration , and access layers to house its key functions .
the staging layer or staging database stores raw data extracted from each of the disparate source data systems .
the integration layer integrates the disparate data sets by transforming the data from the staging layer often storing this transformed data in an operational data store ( ods ) database .
the integrated data are then moved to yet another database , often called the data warehouse database , where the data is arranged into hierarchical groups , often called dimensions , and into facts and aggregate facts .
the combination of facts and dimensions is sometimes called a star schema .
the access layer helps users retrieve data .
the main source of the data is cleansed , transformed , catalogued , and made available for use by managers and other business professionals for data mining , online analytical processing , market research and decision support .
however , the means to retrieve and analyze data , to extract , transform , and load data , and to manage the data dictionary are also considered essential components of a data warehousing system .
many references to data warehousing use this broader context .
thus , an expanded definition for data warehousing includes business intelligence tools , tools to extract , transform , and load data into the repository , and tools to manage and retrieve metadata .
a data warehouse maintains a copy of information from the source transaction systems .
this architectural complexity provides the opportunity to : the environment for data warehouses and marts includes the following : in regards to source systems listed above , r .
kelly rainer states , " a common source for the data in data warehouses is the company's operational databases , which can be relational databases " .
regarding data integration , rainer states , " it is necessary to extract data from source systems , transform them , and load them into a data mart or warehouse " .
rainer discusses storing data in an organization's data warehouse or data marts .
metadata are data about data .
" it personnel need information about data sources ; database , table , and column names ; refresh schedules ; and data usage measures " .
today , the most successful companies are those that can respond quickly and flexibly to market changes and opportunities .
a key to this response is the effective and efficient use of data and information by analysts and managers .
a " data warehouse " is a repository of historical data that are organized by subject to support decision makers in the organization .
once data are stored in a data mart or warehouse , they can be accessed .
a data mart is a simple form of a data warehouse that is focused on a single subject ( or functional area ) , hence they draw data from a limited number of sources such as sales , finance or marketing .
data marts are often built and controlled by a single department within an organization .
the sources could be internal operational systems , a central data warehouse , or external data .
denormalization is the norm for data modeling techniques in this system .
given that data marts generally cover only a subset of the data contained in a data warehouse , they are often easier and faster to implement .
types of data marts include dependent , independent , and hybrid data marts .
online analytical processing ( olap ) is characterized by a relatively low volume of transactions .
queries are often very complex and involve aggregations .
for olap systems , response time is an effectiveness measure .
olap applications are widely used by data mining techniques .
olap databases store aggregated , historical data in multi-dimensional schemas ( usually star schemas ) .
olap systems typically have data latency of a few hours , as opposed to data marts , where latency is expected to be closer to one day .
the olap approach is used to analyze multidimensional data from multiple sources and perspectives .
the three basic operations in olap are : roll-up ( consolidation ) , drill-down and slicing & dicing .
online transaction processing ( oltp ) is characterized by a large number of short on-line transactions ( insert , update , delete ) .
oltp systems emphasize very fast query processing and maintaining data integrity in multi-access environments .
for oltp systems , effectiveness is measured by the number of transactions per second .
oltp databases contain detailed and current data .
the schema used to store transactional databases is the entity model ( usually 3nf ) .
normalization is the norm for data modeling techniques in this system .
predictive analytics is about finding and quantifying hidden patterns in the data using complex mathematical models that can be used to predict future outcomes .
predictive analysis is different from olap in that olap focuses on historical data analysis and is reactive in nature , while predictive analysis focuses on the future .
these systems are also used for customer relationship management ( crm ) .
the concept of data warehousing dates back to the late 1980s when ibm researchers barry devlin and paul murphy developed the " business data warehouse " .
in essence , the data warehousing concept was intended to provide an architectural model for the flow of data from operational systems to decision support environments .
the concept attempted to address the various problems associated with this flow , mainly the high costs associated with it .
in the absence of a data warehousing architecture , an enormous amount of redundancy was required to support multiple decision support environments .
in larger corporations , it was typical for multiple decision support environments to operate independently .
though each environment served different users , they often required much of the same stored data .
the process of gathering , cleaning and integrating data from various sources , usually from long-term existing operational systems ( usually referred to as legacy systems ) , was typically in part replicated for each environment .
moreover , the operational systems were frequently reexamined as new decision support requirements emerged .
often new requirements necessitated gathering , cleaning and integrating new data from " data marts " that was tailored for ready access by users .
key developments in early years of data warehousing were : a fact is a value or measurement , which represents a fact about the managed entity or system .
facts , as reported by the reporting entity , are said to be at raw level .
e .
g .
in a mobile telephone system , if a bts ( base transceiver station ) received *num* , *num* requests for traffic channel allocation , it allocates for *num* , and rejects the remaining , it would report three facts or measurements to a management system : facts at the raw level are further aggregated to higher levels in various dimensions to extract more service or business-relevant information from it .
these are called aggregates or summaries or aggregated facts .
for instance , if there are three bts in a city , then the facts above can be aggregated from the bts to the city level in the network dimension .
for example : there are three or more leading approaches to storing data in a data warehouse — the most important approaches are the dimensional approach and the normalized approach .
the dimensional approach refers to ralph kimball's approach in which it is stated that the data warehouse should be modeled using a dimensional model / star schema .
the normalized approach , also called the 3nf model ( third normal form ) refers to bill inmon's approach in which it is stated that the data warehouse should be modeled using an e-r model / normalized model .
in a dimensional approach , transaction data are partitioned into " facts " , which are generally numeric transaction data , and " dimensions " , which are the reference information that gives context to the facts .
for example , a sales transaction can be broken up into facts such as the number of products ordered and the total price paid for the products , and into dimensions such as order date , customer name , product number , order ship-to and bill-to locations , and salesperson responsible for receiving the order .
a key advantage of a dimensional approach is that the data warehouse is easier for the user to understand and to use .
also , the retrieval of data from the data warehouse tends to operate very quickly .
dimensional structures are easy to understand for business users , because the structure is divided into measurements / facts and context / dimensions .
facts are related to the organization's business processes and operational system whereas the dimensions surrounding them contain context about the measurement ( kimball , ralph *num* ) .
another advantage offered by dimensional model is that it does not involve a relational database every time .
thus , this type of modeling technique is very useful for end-user queries in data warehouse .
the model of facts and dimensions can also be understood as data cube .
where the dimensions are the categorical coordinates in a multi-dimensional cube , while the fact is a value corresponding to the coordinates .
the main disadvantages of the dimensional approach are the following : in the normalized approach , the data in the data warehouse are stored following , to a degree , database normalization rules .
tables are grouped together by " subject areas " that reflect general data categories ( e .
g .
, data on customers , products , finance , etc .
) .
the normalized structure divides data into entities , which creates several tables in a relational database .
when applied in large enterprises the result is dozens of tables that are linked together by a web of joins .
furthermore , each of the created entities is converted into separate physical tables when the database is implemented ( kimball , ralph *num* ) .
the main advantage of this approach is that it is straightforward to add information into the database .
some disadvantages of this approach are that , because of the number of tables involved , it can be difficult for users to join data from different sources into meaningful information and to access the information without a precise understanding of the sources of data and of the data structure of the data warehouse .
both normalized and dimensional models can be represented in entity-relationship diagrams as both contain joined relational tables .
the difference between the two models is the degree of normalization ( also known as normal forms ) .
these approaches are not mutually exclusive , and there are other approaches .
dimensional approaches can involve normalizing data to a degree ( kimball , ralph *num* ) .
in " information-driven business " , robert hillard proposes an approach to comparing the two approaches based on the information needs of the business problem .
the technique shows that normalized models hold far more information than their dimensional equivalents ( even when the same fields are used in both models ) but this extra information comes at the cost of usability .
the technique measures information quantity in terms of information entropy and usability in terms of the small worlds data transformation measure .
in the " bottom-up " approach , data marts are first created to provide reporting and analytical capabilities for specific business processes .
these data marts can then be integrated to create a comprehensive data warehouse .
the data warehouse bus architecture is primarily an implementation of " the bus " , a collection of conformed dimensions and conformed facts , which are dimensions that are shared ( in a specific way ) between facts in two or more data marts .
the " top-down " approach is designed using a normalized enterprise data model .
" atomic " data , that is , data at the greatest level of detail , are stored in the data warehouse .
dimensional data marts containing data needed for specific business processes or specific departments are created from the data warehouse .
data warehouses ( dw ) often resemble the hub and spokes architecture .
legacy systems feeding the warehouse often include customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning , generating large amounts of data .
to consolidate these various data models , and facilitate the extract transform load process , data warehouses often make use of an operational data store , the information from which is parsed into the actual dw .
to reduce data redundancy , larger systems often store the data in a normalized way .
data marts for specific reports can then be built on top of the data warehouse .
a hybrid dw database is kept on third normal form to eliminate data redundancy .
a normal relational database , however , is not efficient for business intelligence reports where dimensional modelling is prevalent .
small data marts can shop for data from the consolidated warehouse and use the filtered , specific data for the fact tables and dimensions required .
the dw provides a single source of information from which the data marts can read , providing a wide range of business information .
the hybrid architecture allows a dw to be replaced with a master data management repository where operational , not static information could reside .
the data vault modeling components follow hub and spokes architecture .
this modeling style is a hybrid design , consisting of the best practices from both third normal form and star schema .
the data vault model is not a true third normal form , and breaks some of its rules , but it is a top-down architecture with a bottom up design .
the data vault model is geared to be strictly a data warehouse .
it is not geared to be end-user accessible , which when built , still requires the use of a data mart or star schema based release area for business purposes .
there are basic features that define the data in the data warehouse that include subject orientation , data integration , time-variant , nonvolatile data , and data granularity .
unlike the operational systems , the data in the data warehouse revolves around subjects of the enterprise ( database normalization ) .
subject orientation can be really useful for decision making .
gathering the required objects is called subject oriented .
the data found within the data warehouse is integrated .
since it comes from several operational systems , all inconsistencies must be removed .
consistencies include naming conventions , measurement of variables , encoding structures , physical attributes of data , and so forth .
while operational systems reflect current values as they support day-to-day operations , data warehouse data represents data over a long time horizon ( up to *num* years ) which means it stores historical data .
it is mainly meant for data mining and forecasting , if a user is searching for a buying pattern of a specific customer , the user needs to look at data on the current and past purchases .
the data in the data warehouse is read-only which means it cannot be updated , created , or deleted .
in the data warehouse , data is summarized at different levels .
the user may start looking at the total sale units of a product in an entire region .
then the user looks at the states in that region .
finally , they may examine the individual stores in a certain state .
therefore , typically , the analysis starts at a higher level and moves down to lower levels of details .
the different methods used to construct / organize a data warehouse specified by an organization are numerous .
the hardware utilized , software created and data resources specifically required for the correct functionality of a data warehouse are the main components of the data warehouse architecture .
all data warehouses have multiple phases in which the requirements of the organization are modified and fine tuned .
operational systems are optimized for preservation of data integrity and speed of recording of business transactions through use of database normalization and an entity-relationship model .
operational system designers generally follow codd's *num* rules of database normalization to ensure data integrity .
fully normalized database designs ( that is , those satisfying all codd rules ) often result in information from a business transaction being stored in dozens to hundreds of tables .
relational databases are efficient at managing the relationships between these tables .
the databases have very fast insert / update performance because only a small amount of data in those tables is affected each time a transaction is processed .
to improve performance , older data are usually periodically purged from operational systems .
data warehouses are optimized for analytic access patterns .
analytic access patterns generally involve selecting specific fields and rarely if ever ' select * ' as is more common in operational databases .
because of these differences in access patterns , operational databases ( loosely , oltp ) benefit from the use of a row-oriented dbms whereas analytics databases ( loosely , olap ) benefit from the use of a column-oriented dbms .
unlike operational systems which maintain a snapshot of the business , data warehouses generally maintain an infinite history which is implemented through etl processes that periodically migrate data from the operational systems over to the data warehouse .
associative property in mathematics , the associative property is a property of some binary operations .
in propositional logic , associativity is a valid rule of replacement for expressions in logical proofs .
within an expression containing two or more occurrences in a row of the same associative operator , the order in which the operations are performed does not matter as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed .
that is , rearranging the parentheses in such an expression will not change its value .
consider the following equations : even though the parentheses were rearranged on each line , the values of the expressions were not altered .
since this holds true when performing addition and multiplication on any real numbers , it can be said that " addition and multiplication of real numbers are associative operations " .
associativity is not the same as commutativity , which addresses whether or not the order of two operands changes the result .
for example , the order does not matter in the multiplication of real numbers , that is , , so we say that the multiplication of real numbers is a commutative operation .
associative operations are abundant in mathematics ; in fact , many algebraic structures ( such as semigroups and categories ) explicitly require their binary operations to be associative .
however , many important and interesting operations are non-associative ; some examples include subtraction , exponentiation , and the vector cross product .
in contrast to the theoretical properties of real numbers , the addition of floating point numbers in computer science is not associative , and the choice of how to associate an expression can have a significant effect on rounding error .
formally , a binary operation ∗ on a set " s " is called associative if it satisfies the associative law : here , ∗ is used to replace the symbol of the operation , which may be any symbol , and even the absence of symbol ( juxtaposition ) as for multiplication .
the associative law can also be expressed in functional notation thus : .
if a binary operation is associative , repeated application of the operation produces the same result regardless how valid pairs of parenthesis are inserted in the expression .
this is called the generalized associative law .
for instance , a product of four elements may be written in five possible ways : if the product operation is associative , the generalized associative law says that all these formulas will yield the same result , making the parenthesis unnecessary .
thus " the " product can be written unambiguously as as the number of elements increases , the number of possible ways to insert parentheses grows quickly , but they remain unnecessary for disambiguation .
some examples of associative operations include the following .
in standard truth-functional propositional logic , " association " , or " associativity " are two valid rules of replacement .
the rules allow one to move parentheses in logical expressions in logical proofs .
the rules ( using logical connectives notation ) are : and where " formula_10 " is a metalogical symbol representing " can be replaced in a proof with .
" "associativity " is a property of some logical connectives of truth-functional propositional logic .
the following logical equivalences demonstrate that associativity is a property of particular connectives .
the following are truth-functional tautologies .
associativity of disjunction : associativity of conjunction : associativity of equivalence : joint denial is an example of a truth functional connective that is " not " associative .
a binary operation formula_17 on a set " s " that does not satisfy the associative law is called non-associative .
symbolically , for such an operation the order of evaluation " does " matter .
for example : also note that infinite sums are not generally associative , for example : whereas the study of non-associative structures arises from reasons somewhat different from the mainstream of classical algebra .
one area within non-associative algebra that has grown very large is that of lie algebras .
there the associative law is replaced by the jacobi identity .
lie algebras abstract the essential nature of infinitesimal transformations , and have become ubiquitous in mathematics .
there are other specific types of non-associative structures that have been studied in depth ; these tend to come from some specific applications or areas such as combinatorial mathematics .
other examples are quasigroup , quasifield , non-associative ring , non-associative algebra and commutative non-associative magmas .
in mathematics , addition and multiplication of real numbers is associative .
by contrast , in computer science , the addition and multiplication of floating point numbers is " not " associative , as rounding errors are introduced when dissimilar-sized values are joined together .
to illustrate this , consider a floating point representation with a 4-bit mantissa : ( *num* .
000×2 + *num* .
000×2 ) + *num* .
000×2 = *num* .
000×2 + *num* .
000×2 = *num* .
00×2 *num* .
000×2 + ( *num* .
000×2 + *num* .
000×2 ) = *num* .
000×2 + *num* .
00×2 = *num* .
00×2 even though most computers compute with a *num* or *num* bits of mantissa , this is an important source of rounding error , and approaches such as the kahan summation algorithm are ways to minimise the errors .
it can be especially problematic in parallel computing .
in general , parentheses must be used to indicate the order of evaluation if a non-associative operation appears more than once in an expression .
however , mathematicians agree on a particular order of evaluation for several common non-associative operations .
this is simply a notational convention to avoid parentheses .
a left-associative operation is a non-associative operation that is conventionally evaluated from left to right , i .
e .
, while a right-associative operation is conventionally evaluated from right to left : both left-associative and right-associative operations occur .
left-associative operations include the following : right-associative operations include the following : non-associative operations for which no conventional evaluation order is defined include the following .
geography of el salvador el salvador borders the north pacific ocean to the south and southwest , with guatemala to the north-northwest and honduras to the north-northeast .
in the southeast , the golfo de fonseca separates it from nicaragua .
el salvador is the smallest central american country and is the only one without a coastline on the caribbean sea .
el salvador , along with the rest of central america , is one of the most seismologically active regions on earth , situated atop three of the large tectonic plates that constitute the earth's surface .
the motion of these plates causes the area's earthquake and volcanic activity .
most of central america and the caribbean basin rests on the relatively motionless caribbean plate .
the pacific ocean floor , however , is being carried northeast by the underlying motion of the cocos plate .
ocean floor material is largely composed of basalt , which is relatively dense ; when it collides with the lighter granite rocks of central america , the ocean floor is forced down under the land mass , creating the deep middle america trench that lies off the coast of el salvador .
the subduction of the cocos plate accounts for the frequency of earthquakes near the coast .
as the rocks constituting the ocean floor are forced down , they melt , and the molten material pours up through weaknesses in the surface rock , producing volcanoes and geysers .
north of el salvador , mexico and most of guatemala are riding on the westward-moving north american plate that butts against the northern edge of the stationary caribbean plate in southern guatemala .
the grinding action of these two plates creates a fault ( similar to the san andreas fault in california ) that runs the length of the valley of the rio motagua in guatemala .
motion along this fault is the source of earthquakes in northernmost el salvador .
el salvador has a long history of destructive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions .
san salvador was destroyed in *num* and *num* , and suffered heavy damage in the *num* , *num* , and *num* tremors .
the country has over twenty volcanoes , although only two , san miguel and izalco , have been active in recent years .
from the early nineteenth century to the mid-1950s , izalco erupted with a regularity that earned it the name " lighthouse of the pacific .
" its brilliant flares were clearly visible for great distances at sea , and at night its glowing lava turned it into a brilliant luminous cone .
two parallel mountain ranges cross el salvador to the west with a central plateau between them and a narrow coastal plain hugging the pacific .
these physical features divide the country into two physiographic regions .
the mountain ranges and central plateau , covering *num* percent of the land , comprise the interior highlands .
the remaining coastal plains are referred to as the pacific lowlands .
the northern range of mountains , the sierra madre , form a continuous chain along the border with honduras .
elevations in this region range from *num* , *num* to *num* , *num* meters .
the area was once heavily forested , but overexploitation led to extensive erosion , and it has become semibarren .
as a result , it is the country's most sparsely populated zone , with little farming or other development .
the southern range of mountains is actually a discontinuous chain of more than twenty volcanoes , clustered into five groups .
the westernmost group , near the guatemalan border , contains izalco and santa ana , which at *num* , *num* meters is the highest volcano in el salvador .
between the cones lie alluvial basins and rolling hills eroded from ash deposits .
the volcanic soil is rich , and much of el salvador's coffee is planted on these slopes .
the central plateau constitutes only *num* percent of the land area but contains the heaviest concentration of population and the country's largest cities .
this plain is about *num* kilometers wide and has an average elevation of *num* meters .
terrain here is rolling , with occasional escarpments , lava fields , and geysers .
a narrow plain extends from the coastal volcanic range to the pacific ocean .
this region has a width ranging from one to thirty-two kilometers with the widest section in the east , adjacent to the golfo de fonseca .
near la libertad , however , the mass of the mountains push the lowlands out ; the slopes of adjacent volcanoes come down directly to the ocean .
surfaces in the pacific lowlands are generally flat or gently rolling and result from the alluvial deposits of nearby slopes .
el salvador has over *num* rivers , the most important of which is the rio lempa .
originating in guatemala , the rio lempa cuts across the northern range of mountains , flows along much of the central plateau , and finally cuts through the southern volcanic range to empty into the pacific .
it is el salvador's only navigable river , it and its tributaries drain about half the country .
other rivers are generally short and drain the pacific lowlands or flow from the central plateau through gaps in the southern mountain range to the pacific .
numerous lakes of volcanic origin are found in the interior highlands ; many of these lakes are surrounded by mountains and have high , steep banks .
the largest lake , the lago de ilopango , lies just to the east of the capital .
other large lakes include the lago de coatepeque in the west and the lago de güija on the guatemalan border .
the cerron grande dam on the rio lempa has created a large reservoir , the embalse cerron grande , in northern el salvador .
izalco has erupted at least *num* times since *num* .
it earned the nickname " lighthouse of the pacific " because it was the most active volcano in central america .
el salvador has a tropical climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons .
temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change .
the pacific lowlands are uniformly hot and humid ; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate .
the rainy season , known locally as " invierno " , or winter , extends from may to october .
almost all the annual rainfall and the highest humidity occurs during this time , and yearly rain totals , particularly on southern-facing mountain slopes , can be as high as .
protected areas and the central plateau receive lesser , although still significant , amounts .
rainfall during this season generally comes from low pressure over the pacific and usually falls in heavy afternoon thunderstorms .
although hurricanes occasionally form in the pacific , they seldom affect el salvador , with the notable exception of hurricane mitch in *num* ( which actually formed over the atlantic basin ) and hurricane emily in *num* .
from november through april , the northeast trade winds control weather patterns .
during these months , air flowing from the caribbean has lost most of its precipitation while passing over the mountains in honduras .
by the time this air reaches el salvador , it is dry , hot , and hazy .
this season is known locally as " verano " , or summer .
temperatures vary little with season ; elevation is the primary determinant .
the pacific lowlands are the hottest region , with annual averages ranging from .
san salvador is representative of the central plateau , with an annual average temperature of and absolute high and low readings of , respectively .
mountain areas are the coolest , with annual averages from and minimum temperatures sometimes approaching freezing .
el salvador's physical shape form , evokes a similar resemblance to a rugged and miniature version of the u .
s state of california .
during the 1980s , the country's coastal roads were compared to california's coastal roads by american surfers and el salvador became known as the wild west of central america , characterized by roughness and lawlessness .
the total land area of el salvador is *num* , *num* km² , with *num* , *num* km² of land and *num* km² of water .
this is slightly smaller than the u .
s .
state of massachusetts .
el salvador has *num* km of borders , including *num* km of borders with honduras and *num* km with guatemala .
el salvador has a coastline of *num* km .
el salvador claims a territorial sea of .
climate : tropical ; rainy season ( may to october ) ; dry season ( november to april ) ; tropical on coast ; temperate in uplands terrain : mostly mountains with narrow coastal belt and central plateau the lowest point of elevation in el salvador is the pacific ocean , at sea level .
the highest point is cerro el pital , at *num* , *num* m .

el salvador is party to the convention on biological diversity , united nations framework convention on climate change , kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change , united nations convention to combat desertification , cites , basel convention , partial test ban treaty , montreal protocol , ramsar convention .
el salvador has signed , but not ratified the united nations convention on the law of the sea .
concorde the aérospatiale / bac concorde ( ) is a british-french turbojet-powered supersonic passenger airliner that was operated from *num* until *num* .
it had a maximum speed over twice the speed of sound at mach *num* .
*num* ( at cruise altitude ) , with seating for *num* to *num* passengers .
first flown in *num* , concorde entered service in *num* and continued flying for the next *num* years .
it is one of only two supersonic transports to have been operated commercially ; the other is the soviet-built tupolev tu-144 , which operated in service from *num* to *num* .
concorde was jointly developed and manufactured by sud aviation ( later aérospatiale ) and the british aircraft corporation ( bac ) under an anglo-french treaty .
twenty aircraft were built , including six prototypes and development aircraft .
air france ( af ) and british airways ( ba ) were the only airlines to purchase and fly concorde .
the aircraft was used mainly by wealthy passengers who could afford to pay a high price in exchange for the aircraft's speed and luxury service .
for example , in *num* , the round-trip ticket price from new york to london was $7 , *num* ( $ in dollars ) , more than *num* times the cost of the cheapest option to fly this route .
the original program cost estimate of £70 million met huge overruns and delays , with the program eventually costing £1 .
*num* billion .
it was this extreme cost that became the main factor in the production run being much smaller than anticipated .
later , another factor which affected the viability of all supersonic transport programmes was that supersonic flight could only be used on ocean-crossing routes , to prevent sonic boom disturbance over populated areas .
with only seven airframes each being operated by the british and french , the per-unit cost was impossible to recoup , so the french and british governments absorbed the development costs .
british airways and air france were able to operate concorde at a profit , in spite of very high maintenance costs , because the aircraft was able to sustain a high ticket price .
among other destinations , concorde flew regular transatlantic flights from london's heathrow airport and paris's charles de gaulle airport to john f .
kennedy international airport in new york , washington dulles international airport in virginia , and grantley adams international airport in barbados ; it flew these routes in less than half the time of other airliners .
concorde won the *num* great british design quest organised by the bbc and the design museum , beating other well-known designs such as the bmc mini , the miniskirt , the jaguar e-type , the london tube map and the supermarine spitfire .
the type was retired in *num* , three years after the crash of air france flight *num* , in which all passengers and crew were killed .
the general downturn in the commercial aviation industry after the september *num* attacks in *num* and the end of maintenance support for concorde by airbus ( the successor company of both aérospatiale and bac ) also contributed .
the origins of the concorde project date to the early 1950s , when arnold hall , director of the royal aircraft establishment ( rae ) asked morien morgan to form a committee to study the supersonic transport ( sst ) concept .
the group met for the first time in february *num* and delivered their first report in april *num* .
at the time it was known that the drag at supersonic speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing .
this led to the use of very short-span , very thin trapezoidal wings such as those seen on the control surfaces of many missiles , or in aircraft like the lockheed f-104 starfighter or the avro *num* that the team studied .
the team outlined a baseline configuration that looked like an enlarged avro *num* .
this same short span produced very little lift at low speed , which resulted in extremely long take-off runs and frighteningly high landing speeds .
in an sst design , this would have required enormous engine power to lift off from existing runways , and to provide the fuel needed , " some horribly large aeroplanes " resulted .
based on this , the group considered the concept of an sst infeasible , and instead suggested continued low-level studies into supersonic aerodynamics .
soon after , johanna weber and dietrich küchemann at the rae published a series of reports on a new wing planform , known in the uk as the " slender delta " concept .
the team , including eric maskell whose report " flow separation in three dimensions " contributed to an understanding of the physical nature of separated flow , worked with the fact that delta wings can produce strong vortices on their upper surfaces at high angles of attack .
the vortex will lower the air pressure and cause lift to be greatly increased .
this effect had been noticed earlier , notably by chuck yeager in the convair xf-92 , but its qualities had not been fully appreciated .
weber suggested that this was no mere curiosity , and the effect could be deliberately used to improve low speed performance .
küchemann's and weber's papers changed the entire nature of supersonic design almost overnight .
although the delta had already been used on aircraft prior to this point , these designs used planforms that were not much different from a swept wing of the same span .
weber noted that the lift from the vortex was increased by the length of the wing it had to operate over , which suggested that the effect would be maximised by extending the wing along the fuselage as far as possible .
such a layout would still have good supersonic performance inherent to the short span , while also offering reasonable take-off and landing speeds using vortex generation .
the only downside to such a design is that the aircraft would have to take off and land very " nose high " to generate the required vortex lift , which led to questions about the low speed handling qualities of such a design .
it would also need to have long landing gear to produce the required angle of attack while still on the runway .
küchemann presented the idea at a meeting where morgan was also present .
test pilot eric brown recalls morgan's reaction to the presentation , saying that he immediately seized on it as the solution to the sst problem .
brown considers this moment as being the true birth of the concorde project .
on *num* october *num* the ministry of supply asked morgan to form a new study group , the " supersonic transport aircraft committee " ( " stac " ) ( sometimes referred to as the " supersonic transport advisory committee " ) , with the explicit goal of developing a practical sst design and finding industry partners to build it .
at the very first meeting , on *num* november *num* , the decision was made to fund the development of a test bed aircraft to examine the low-speed performance of the slender delta , a contract that eventually produced the handley page hp .
*num* .
this aircraft would ultimately demonstrate safe control at speeds as low as , about that of the f-104 starfighter .
stac stated that an sst would have economic performance similar to existing subsonic types .
although they would burn more fuel in cruise , they would be able to fly more sorties in a given period of time , so fewer aircraft would be needed to service a particular route .
this would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs , as it did at the time .
stac suggested that two designs naturally fell out of their work , a transatlantic model flying at about mach *num* , and a shorter-range version flying at perhaps mach *num* .
*num* .
morgan suggested that a 150-passenger transatlantic sst would cost about £75 to £90 million to develop , and be in service in *num* .
the smaller *num* passenger short-range version would cost perhaps £50 to £80 million , and be ready for service in *num* .
to meet this schedule , development would need to begin in *num* , with production contracts let in *num* .
morgan strongly suggested that the us was already involved in a similar project , and that if the uk failed to respond it would be locked out of an airliner market that he believed would be dominated by sst aircraft .
in *num* , a study contract was awarded to hawker siddeley and bristol for preliminary designs based on the slender delta concept , which developed as the hsa .
*num* and bristol *num* .
armstrong whitworth also responded with an internal design , the m-wing , for the lower-speed shorter-range category .
even at this early time , both the stac group and the government were looking for partners to develop the designs .
in september *num* , hawker approached lockheed , and after the creation of british aircraft corporation in *num* , the former bristol team immediately started talks with boeing , general dynamics , douglas aircraft and sud aviation .
küchemann and others at the rae continued their work on the slender delta throughout this period , considering three basic shapes ; the classic straight-edge delta , the " gothic delta " that was rounded outwards to appear like a gothic arch , and the " ogival wing " that was compound-rounded into the shape of an ogee .
each of these planforms had its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of aerodynamics .
as they worked with these shapes , a practical concern grew to become so important that it forced selection of one of these designs .
generally one wants to have the wing's centre of pressure ( cp , or " lift point " ) close to the aircraft's centre of gravity ( cg , or " balance point " ) to reduce the amount of control force required to pitch the aircraft .
as the aircraft layout changes during the design phase , it is common for the cg to move fore or aft .
with a normal wing design this can be addressed by moving the wing slightly fore or aft to account for this .
with a delta wing running most of the length of the fuselage , this was no longer easy ; moving the wing would leave it in front of the nose or behind the tail .
studying the various layouts in terms of cg changes , both during design and changes due to fuel use during flight , the ogee planform immediately came to the fore .
while the wing planform was evolving , so was the basic sst concept .
bristol's original type *num* was a small design with an almost pure slender delta wing , but evolved into the larger type *num* .
by this time similar political and economic concerns in france had led to their own sst plans .
in the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government-owned sud aviation and nord aviation , as well as dassault .
all three returned designs based on küchemann and weber's slender delta ; nord suggested a ramjet powered design flying at mach *num* , the other two were jet powered mach *num* designs that were similar to each other .
of the three , the sud aviation super-caravelle won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic us designs they assumed were already on the drawing board .
as soon as the design was complete , in april *num* , pierre satre , the company's technical director , was sent to bristol to discuss a partnership .
bristol was surprised to find that the sud team had designed a very similar aircraft after considering the sst problem and coming to the very same conclusions as the bristol and stac teams in terms of economics .
it was later revealed that the original stac report , marked " for uk eyes only " , had secretly been passed to the french to win political favour .
sud made minor changes to the paper , and presented it as their own work .
unsurprisingly , the two teams found much to agree on .
the french had no modern large jet engines , and had already concluded they would buy a british design anyway ( as they had on the earlier subsonic caravelle ) .
as neither company had experience in the use of high-heat metals for airframes , a maximum speed of around mach *num* was selected so aluminium could be used – above this speed the friction with the air warms the metal so much that aluminium begins to soften .
this lower speed would also speed development and allow their design to fly before the americans .
finally , everyone involved agreed that küchemann's ogee shaped wing was the right one .
the only disagreements were over the size and range .
the uk team was still focused on a 150-passenger design serving transatlantic routes , while the french were deliberately avoiding these .
however , this proved not to be the barrier it might seem ; common components could be used in both designs , with the shorter range version using a clipped fuselage and four engines , the longer one with a stretched fuselage and six engines , leaving only the wing to be extensively re-designed .
the teams continued to meet through *num* , and by this time it was clear that the two aircraft would be considerably more similar in spite of different range and seating arrangements .
a single design emerged that differed mainly in fuel load .
more powerful bristol siddeley olympus engines , being developed for the tsr-2 , allowed either design to be powered by only four engines .
while the development teams met , french minister of public works and transport robert buron was meeting with the uk minister of aviation peter thorneycroft , and thorneycroft soon revealed to the cabinet that the french were much more serious about a partnership than any of the us companies .
the various us companies had proved uninterested in such a venture , likely due to the belief that the government would be funding development and would frown on any partnership with a european company , and the risk of " giving away " us technological leadership to a european partner .
when the stac plans were presented to the uk cabinet , a very negative reaction resulted .
the economic considerations were considered highly questionable , especially as these were based on development costs , now estimated to be £150 million , which were repeatedly overrun in the industry .
the treasury ministry in particular presented a very negative view , suggesting that there was no way the project would have any positive financial returns for the government , especially in light that " the industry's past record of over-optimistic estimating ( including the recent history of the tsr .
*num* ) suggests that it would be prudent to consider the £150 million [ cost ] to turn out much too low .
" this concern led to an independent review of the project by the committee on civil scientific research and development , which met on topic between july and september *num* .
the committee ultimately rejected the economic arguments , including considerations of supporting the industry made by thorneycroft .
their report in october stated that it was unlikely there would be any direct positive economic outcome , but that the project should still be considered for the simple reason that everyone else was going supersonic , and they were concerned they would be locked out of future markets .
conversely , it appeared the project would not be likely to significantly impact other , more important , research efforts .
after considerable argument , the decision to proceed ultimately fell to an unlikely political expediency .
at the time , the uk was pressing for admission to the european common market , which was being controlled by charles de gaulle who felt the uk's special relationship with the us made them unacceptable in a pan-european group .
cabinet felt that signing a deal with sud would pave the way for common market entry , and this became the main deciding reason for moving ahead with the deal .
it was this belief that had led the original stac documents being leaked to the french .
however , de gaulle spoke of the european origin of the design , and continued to block the uk's entry into the common market .
the development project was negotiated as an international treaty between the two countries rather than a commercial agreement between companies and included a clause , originally asked for by the uk , imposing heavy penalties for cancellation .
a draft treaty was signed on *num* november *num* .
reflecting the treaty between the british and french governments that led to concorde's construction , the name " concorde " is from the french word " concorde " ( ) , which has an english equivalent , " concord " .
both words mean " agreement " , " harmony " or " union " .
the name was officially changed to " concord " by harold macmillan in response to a perceived slight by charles de gaulle .
at the french roll-out in toulouse in late *num* , the british government minister for technology , tony benn , announced that he would change the spelling back to " concorde " .
this created a nationalist uproar that died down when benn stated that the suffixed " e " represented " excellence , england , europe and entente ( cordiale ) " .
in his memoirs , he recounts a tale of a letter from an irate scotsman claiming : " [ y ] ou talk about ' e ' for england , but part of it is made in scotland .
" given scotland's contribution of providing the nose cone for the aircraft , benn replied , " [ i ] t was also ' e ' for ' écosse ' ( the french name for scotland ) – and i might have added ' e ' for extravagance and ' e ' for escalation as well ! " concorde also acquired an unusual nomenclature for an aircraft .
in common usage in the united kingdom , the type is known as " concorde " without an article , rather than the concorde " or a concorde " .
described by " flight international " as an " aviation icon " and " one of aerospace's most ambitious but commercially flawed projects " , concorde failed to meet its original sales targets , despite initial interest from several airlines .
at first , the new consortium intended to produce one long-range and one short-range version .
however , prospective customers showed no interest in the short-range version and it was dropped .
an advertisement covering two full pages , promoting concorde , ran in the *num* may *num* issue of " aviation week & space technology " .
the advertisement predicted a market for *num* aircraft by *num* and boasted of concorde's head start over the united states ' sst project .
concorde had considerable difficulties that led to its dismal sales performance .
costs had spiralled during development to more than six times the original projections , arriving at a unit cost of £23 million in *num* ( equivalent to £ million in ) .
its sonic boom made travelling supersonically over land impossible without causing complaints from citizens .
world events had also dampened concorde sales prospects , the 1973-74 stock market crash and the *num* oil crisis had made many airlines cautious about aircraft with high fuel consumption rates ; and new wide-body aircraft , such as the boeing *num* , had recently made subsonic aircraft significantly more efficient and presented a low-risk option for airlines .
while carrying a full load , concorde achieved *num* .
*num* passenger miles per gallon of fuel , while the boeing *num* reached *num* .
*num* pm / g , the boeing *num* *num* .
*num* pm / g , and the mcdonnell douglas dc-10 *num* .
*num* pm / g .
an emerging trend in the industry in favour of cheaper airline tickets had also caused airlines such as qantas to question concorde's market suitability .
the consortium secured orders ( i .
e .
, non-binding options ) for over *num* of the long-range version from the major airlines of the day : pan am , boac , and air france were the launch customers , with six concordes each .
other airlines in the order book included panair do brasil , continental airlines , japan airlines , lufthansa , american airlines , united airlines , air india , air canada , braniff , singapore airlines , iran air , olympic airways , qantas , caac airlines , middle east airlines , and twa .
at the time of the first flight the options list contained *num* options from *num* airlines : the design work was supported by a preceding research programme studying the flight characteristics of low ratio delta wings .
a supersonic fairey delta *num* was modified to carry the ogee planform , and , renamed as the bac *num* , used for flight tests of the high speed flight envelope , the handley page hp .
*num* also provided valuable information on low speed performance .
construction of two prototypes began in february *num* : *num* , built by aérospatiale at toulouse , and *num* , by bac at filton , bristol .
concorde *num* made its first test flight from toulouse on *num* march *num* , piloted by andré turcat , and first went supersonic on *num* october .
the first uk-built concorde flew from filton to raf fairford on *num* april *num* , piloted by brian trubshaw .
both prototypes were presented to the public for the first time on 7–8 june *num* at the paris air show .
as the flight programme progressed , *num* embarked on a sales and demonstration tour on *num* september *num* , which was also the first transatlantic crossing of concorde .
concorde *num* followed suit on *num* june *num* with a tour of the middle and far east .
concorde *num* made the first visit to the united states in *num* , landing at the new dallas / fort worth regional airport to mark that airport's opening .
during testing , concorde f-wtsb attained the highest altitude recorded in sustained level flight of a passenger aircraft of *num* , *num* ft , in june *num* .
concorde g-axdn attained the highest recorded speed of mach *num* .
*num* on *num* march *num* , at an altitude of *num* , *num* ft .
while concorde had initially held a great deal of customer interest , the project was hit by a large number of order cancellations .
the paris le bourget air show crash of the competing soviet tupolev tu-144 had shocked potential buyers , and public concern over the environmental issues presented by a supersonic aircraft—the sonic boom , take-off noise and pollution—had produced a shift in public opinion of ssts .
by *num* four nations remained as prospective buyers : britain , france , china , and iran .
only air france and british airways ( the successor to boac ) took up their orders , with the two governments taking a cut of any profits made .
the united states cancelled the boeing *num* , its rival supersonic transport programme , in *num* .
observers have suggested that opposition to concorde on grounds of noise pollution had been encouraged by the united states government , as it lacked its own competitor .
the us , india , and malaysia all ruled out concorde supersonic flights over the noise concern , although some of these restrictions were later relaxed .
professor douglas ross characterised restrictions placed upon concorde operations by president jimmy carter's administration as having been an act of protectionism of american aircraft manufacturers .
concorde flew to an altitude of *num* , *num* ft ( *num* , *num* m ) during a test flight in june *num* .
concorde is an ogival delta winged aircraft with four olympus engines based on those employed in the raf's avro vulcan strategic bomber .
it is one of the few commercial aircraft to employ a tailless design ( the tupolev tu-144 being another ) .
concorde was the first airliner to have a ( in this case , analogue ) fly-by-wire flight-control system ; the avionics system concorde used was unique because it was the first commercial aircraft to employ hybrid circuits .
the principal designer for the project was pierre satre , with sir archibald russell as his deputy .
concorde pioneered the following technologies : for high speed and optimisation of flight : for weight-saving and enhanced performance : a symposium titled " supersonic-transport implications " was hosted by the royal aeronautical society on *num* december *num* .
various views were put forward on the likely type of powerplant for a supersonic transport , such as podded or buried installation and turbojet or ducted-fan engines .
boundary layer management in the podded installation was put forward as simpler with only an inlet cone but dr .
seddon of the rae saw " a future in a more sophisticated integration of shapes " in a buried installation .
another concern highlighted the case with two or more engines situated behind a single intake .
an intake failure could lead to a double or triple engine failure .
the advantage of the ducted fan over the turbojet was reduced airport noise but with considerable economic penalties with its larger cross-section producing excessive drag .
at that time it was considered that the noise from a turbojet optimised for supersonic cruise could be reduced to an acceptable level using noise suppressors as used on subsonic jets .
the powerplant configuration selected for concorde , and its development to a certificated design , can be seen in light of the above symposium topics ( which highlighted airfield noise , boundary layer management and interactions between adjacent engines ) and the requirement that the powerplant , at mach *num* , tolerate combinations of pushovers , sideslips , pull-ups and throttle slamming without surging .
extensive development testing with design changes and changes to intake and engine control laws would address most of the issues except airfield noise and the interaction between adjacent powerplants at speeds above mach *num* .
*num* which meant concorde " had to be certified aerodynamically as a twin-engined aircraft above mach *num* .
*num* " .
rolls-royce had a design proposal , the rb .
*num* , for the aircraft at the time of concorde's initial design but " to develop a brand-new engine for concorde would have been prohibitively expensive " so an existing engine , already flying in the tsr-2 prototype , was chosen .
it was the olympus *num* turbojet , a development of the bristol engine first used for the avro vulcan bomber .
great confidence was placed in being able to reduce the noise of a turbojet and massive strides by snecma in silencer design were reported during the programme .
however , by *num* the spade silencers which projected into the exhaust were reported to be ineffective .
the olympus mk .
*num* with reduced jet velocity was proposed to reduce the noise but it was not developed .
situated behind the leading edge of the wing the engine intake had wing boundary layer ahead of it .
two thirds was diverted and the remaining third which entered the intake did not adversely affect the intake efficiency except during pushovers when the boundary layer thickened ahead of the intake and caused surging .
extensive wind tunnel testing helped define leading edge modifications ahead of the intakes which solved the problem .
each engine had its own intake and the engine nacelles were paired with a splitter plate between them to minimise adverse behaviour of one powerplant influencing the other .
only above mach *num* .
*num* was an engine surge likely to affect the adjacent engine .
concorde needed to fly long distances to be economically viable ; this required high efficiency from the powerplant .
turbofan engines were rejected due to their larger cross-section producing excessive drag .
olympus turbojet technology was available to be developed to meet the design requirements of the aircraft , although turbofans would be studied for any future sst .
the aircraft used reheat ( afterburners ) at take-off and to pass through the upper transonic regime and to supersonic speeds , between mach *num* .
*num* and mach *num* .
*num* .
the afterburners were switched off at all other times .
due to jet engines being highly inefficient at low speeds , concorde burned two tonnes of fuel ( almost *num* % of the maximum fuel load ) taxiing to the runway .
fuel used is jet a-1 .
due to the high thrust produced even with the engines at idle , only the two outer engines were run after landing for easier taxiing and less brake pad wear – at low weights after landing , the aircraft would not remain stationary with all four engines idling requiring the brakes to be continuously applied to prevent the aircraft from rolling .
the intake design for concorde's engines was especially critical .
the intakes had to provide low distortion levels ( to prevent engine surge ) and high efficiency for all likely ambient temperatures to be met in cruise .
they had to provide adequate subsonic performance for diversion cruise and low engine-face distortion at take-off .
they also had to provide an alternative path for excess intake air during engine throttling or shutdowns .
the variable intake features required to meet all these requirements consisted of front and rear ramps , a dump door , an auxiliary inlet and a ramp bleed to the exhaust nozzle .
as well as supplying air to the engine , the intake also supplied air through the ramp bleed to the propelling nozzle .
the nozzle ejector ( or aerodynamic ) design , with variable exit area and secondary flow from the intake , contributed to good expansion efficiency from take-off to cruise .
engine failure causes problems on conventional subsonic aircraft ; not only does the aircraft lose thrust on that side but the engine creates drag , causing the aircraft to yaw and bank in the direction of the failed engine .
if this had happened to concorde at supersonic speeds , it theoretically could have caused a catastrophic failure of the airframe .
although computer simulations predicted considerable problems , in practice concorde could shut down both engines on the same side of the aircraft at mach *num* without the predicted difficulties .
during an engine failure the required air intake is virtually zero .
so , on concorde , engine failure was countered by the opening of the auxiliary spill door and the full extension of the ramps , which deflected the air downwards past the engine , gaining lift and minimising drag .
concorde pilots were routinely trained to handle double engine failure .
concorde's air intake control units ( aicus ) made use of a digital processor to provide the necessary accuracy for intake control .
it was the world's first use of a digital processor to be given full authority control of an essential system in a passenger aircraft .
it was developed by the electronics and space systems ( ess ) division of the british aircraft corporation after it became clear that the analogue aicus fitted to the prototype aircraft and developed by ultra electronics were found to be insufficiently accurate for the tasks in hand .
concorde's thrust-by-wire engine control system was developed by ultra electronics .
air compression on the outer surfaces caused the cabin to heat up during flight .
every surface , such as windows and panels , was warm to the touch by the end of the flight .
besides engines , the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft is the nose , due to aerodynamic heating .
the engineers used hiduminium r .
r .
*num* , an aluminium alloy , throughout the aircraft because of its familiarity , cost and ease of construction .
the highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was , which limited the top speed to mach *num* .
*num* .
concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight , first cooling down as it gained altitude , then heating up after going supersonic .
the reverse happened when descending and slowing down .
this had to be factored into the metallurgical and fatigue modelling .
a test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing , and then cooled it , and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing .
the concorde airframe was designed for a life of *num* , *num* flying hours .
owing to air compression in front of the plane as it travelled at supersonic speed , the fuselage heated up and expanded by as much as *num* mm ( almost *num* ft ) .
the most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the flight engineer's console and the bulkhead .
on some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight , the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap , wedging the cap when it shrank again .
to keep the cabin cool , concorde used the fuel as a heat sink for the heat from the air conditioning .
the same method also cooled the hydraulics .
during supersonic flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became heated , and a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit .
concorde had livery restrictions ; the majority of the surface had to be covered with a highly reflective white paint to avoid overheating the aluminium structure due to heating effects from supersonic flight at mach *num* .
the white finish reduced the skin temperature by *num* to *num* degrees celsius .
in *num* , air france briefly painted f-btsd in a predominantly blue livery , with the exception of the wings , in a promotional deal with pepsi .
in this paint scheme , air france was advised to remain at mach *num* for no more than *num* minutes at a time , but there was no restriction at speeds under mach *num* .
*num* .
f-btsd was used because it was not scheduled for any long flights that required extended mach *num* operations .
due to its high speeds , large forces were applied to the aircraft during banks and turns , and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure .
in addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds .
both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard elevons , varying at differing speeds including supersonic .
only the innermost elevons , which are attached to the stiffest area of the wings , were active at high speed .
additionally , the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed .
this was visible from the rear passengers ' viewpoints .
when any aircraft passes the critical mach of that particular airframe , the centre of pressure shifts rearwards .
this causes a pitch down moment on the aircraft if the centre of gravity remains where it was .
the engineers designed the wings in a specific manner to reduce this shift , but there was still a shift of about *num* metres .
this could have been countered by the use of trim controls , but at such high speeds this would have dramatically increased drag .
instead , the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move the centre of gravity , effectively acting as an auxiliary trim control .
to fly non-stop across the atlantic ocean , concorde required the greatest supersonic range of any aircraft .
this was achieved by a combination of engines which were highly efficient at supersonic speeds , a slender fuselage with high fineness ratio , and a complex wing shape for a high lift-to-drag ratio .
this also required carrying only a modest payload and a high fuel capacity , and the aircraft was trimmed with precision to avoid unnecessary drag .
nevertheless , soon after concorde began flying , a concorde " b " model was designed with slightly larger fuel capacity and slightly larger wings with leading edge slats to improve aerodynamic performance at all speeds , with the objective of expanding the range to reach markets in new regions .
it featured more powerful engines with sound deadening and without the fuel-hungry and noisy afterburner .
it was speculated that it was reasonably possible to create an engine with up to *num* % gain in efficiency over the rolls-royce / snecma olympus *num* .
this would have given additional range and a greater payload , making new commercial routes possible .
this was cancelled due in part to poor sales of concorde , but also to the rising cost of aviation fuel in the 1970s .
concorde's high cruising altitude meant passengers received almost twice the flux of extraterrestrial ionising radiation as those travelling on a conventional long-haul flight .
upon concorde's introduction , it was speculated that this exposure during supersonic travels would increase the likelihood of skin cancer .
due to the proportionally reduced flight time , the overall equivalent dose would normally be less than a conventional flight over the same distance .
unusual solar activity might lead to an increase in incident radiation .
to prevent incidents of excessive radiation exposure , the flight deck had a radiometer and an instrument to measure the rate of decrease of radiation .
if the radiation level became too high , concorde would descend below .
airliner cabins were usually maintained at a pressure equivalent to *num* , 000–8 , *num* feet ( *num* , 800–2 , *num* m ) elevation .
concorde's pressurisation was set to an altitude at the lower end of this range , .
concorde's maximum cruising altitude was ; subsonic airliners typically cruise below .
a sudden reduction in cabin pressure is hazardous to all passengers and crew .
above , a sudden cabin depressurisation would leave a " time of useful consciousness " up to 10–15 seconds for a conditioned athlete .
at concorde's altitude , the air density is very low ; a breach of cabin integrity would result in a loss of pressure severe enough that the plastic emergency oxygen masks installed on other passenger jets would not be effective and passengers would soon suffer from hypoxia despite quickly donning them .
concorde was equipped with smaller windows to reduce the rate of loss in the event of a breach , a reserve air supply system to augment cabin air pressure , and a rapid descent procedure to bring the aircraft to a safe altitude .
the faa enforces minimum emergency descent rates for aircraft and noting concorde's higher operating altitude , concluded that the best response to pressure loss would be a rapid descent .
continuous positive airway pressure would have delivered pressurised oxygen directly to the pilots through masks .
while subsonic commercial jets took eight hours to fly from new york to paris , the average supersonic flight time on the transatlantic routes was just under *num* .
*num* hours .
concorde had a maximum cruise altitude of and an average cruise speed of mach *num* .
*num* , about *num* knots ( *num* km / h or *num* mph ) , more than twice the speed of conventional aircraft .
with no other civil traffic operating at its cruising altitude of about , concorde had exclusive use of dedicated oceanic airways , or " tracks " , separate from the north atlantic tracks , the routes used by other aircraft to cross the atlantic .
due to the significantly less variable nature of high altitude winds compared to those at standard cruising altitudes , these dedicated sst tracks had fixed co-ordinates , unlike the standard routes at lower altitudes , whose co-ordinates are replotted twice daily based on forecast weather patterns ( jetstreams ) .
concorde would also be cleared in a block , allowing for a slow climb from *num* , *num* to during the oceanic crossing as the fuel load gradually decreased .
in regular service , concorde employed an efficient " cruise-climb " flight profile following take-off .
the delta-shaped wings required concorde to adopt a higher angle of attack at low speeds than conventional aircraft , but it allowed the formation of large low pressure vortices over the entire upper wing surface , maintaining lift .
the normal landing speed was .
because of this high angle , during a landing approach concorde was on the " back side " of the drag force curve , where raising the nose would increase the rate of descent ; the aircraft was thus largely flown on the throttle and was fitted with an autothrottle to reduce the pilot's workload .
because of the way concorde's delta-wing generated lift , the undercarriage had to be unusually strong and tall to allow for the angle of attack at low speed .
at rotation , concorde would rise to a high angle of attack , about *num* degrees .
prior to rotation the wing generated almost no lift , unlike typical aircraft wings .
combined with the high airspeed at rotation ( *num* knots indicated airspeed ) , this increased the stresses on the main undercarriage in a way that was initially unexpected during the development and required a major redesign .
due to the high angle needed at rotation , a small set of wheels was added aft to prevent tailstrikes .
the main undercarriage units swing towards each other to be stowed but due to their great height also need to contract in length telescopically before swinging to clear each other when stowed .
the four main wheel tyres on each bogie unit are inflated to .
the twin-wheel nose undercarriage retracts forwards and its tyres are inflated to a pressure of , and the wheel assembly carries a spray deflector to prevent standing water being thrown up into the engine intakes .
the tyres are rated to a maximum speed on the runway of .
the starboard nose wheel carries a single disc brake to halt wheel rotation during retraction of the undercarriage .
the port nose wheel carries speed generators for the anti-skid braking system which prevents brake activation until nose and main wheels rotate at the same rate .
additionally , due to the high average take-off speed of , concorde needed upgraded brakes .
like most airliners , concorde has anti-skid braking – a system which prevents the tyres from losing traction when the brakes are applied for greater control during roll-out .
the brakes , developed by dunlop , were the first carbon-based brakes used on an airliner .
the use of carbon over equivalent steel brakes provided a weight-saving of .
each wheel has multiple discs which are cooled by electric fans .
wheel sensors include brake overload , brake temperature , and tyre deflation .
after a typical landing at heathrow , brake temperatures were around .
landing concorde required a minimum of runway length , this in fact being considerably less than the shortest runway concorde ever actually landed on , that of cardiff airport .
concorde's drooping nose , developed by marshall's of cambridge at cambridge airport , enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimal aerodynamic efficiency without obstructing the pilot's view during taxi , take-off , and landing operations .
due to the high angle of attack , the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop .
the droop nose was accompanied by a moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered .
when the nose was raised to horizontal , the visor would rise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining .
a controller in the cockpit allowed the visor to be retracted and the nose to be lowered to 5° below the standard horizontal position for taxiing and take-off .
following take-off and after clearing the airport , the nose and visor were raised .
prior to landing , the visor was again retracted and the nose lowered to *num* .
5° below horizontal for maximal visibility .
upon landing the nose was raised to the 5° position to avoid the possibility of damage .
the us federal aviation administration had objected to the restrictive visibility of the visor used on the first two prototype concordes , which had been designed before a suitable high-temperature window glass had become available , and thus requiring alteration before the faa would permit concorde to serve us airports .
this led to the redesigned visor used on the production and the four pre-production aircraft ( *num* , *num* , *num* , and *num* ) .
the nose window and visor glass , needed to endure temperatures in excess of at supersonic flight , were developed by triplex .
"concorde *num* " was modified with rooftop portholes for use on the *num* solar eclipse mission and equipped with observation instruments .
it performed the longest observation of a solar eclipse to date , about *num* minutes .
scheduled flights began on *num* january *num* on the london–bahrain and paris–rio de janeiro ( via dakar ) routes , with ba flights using the " speedbird concorde " call sign to notify air traffic control of the aircraft's unique abilities and restrictions , but the french using their normal call signs .
the paris-caracas route ( via azores ) began on *num* april .
the us congress had just banned concorde landings in the us , mainly due to citizen protest over sonic booms , preventing launch on the coveted north atlantic routes .
the us secretary of transportation , william coleman , gave permission for concorde service to washington dulles international airport , and air france and british airways simultaneously began a thrice-weekly service to dulles on *num* may *num* .
due to low demand , air france cancelled its washington service in october *num* , while british airways cancelled it in november *num* .
when the us ban on jfk concorde operations was lifted in february *num* , new york banned concorde locally .
the ban came to an end on *num* october *num* when the supreme court of the united states declined to overturn a lower court's ruling rejecting efforts by the port authority of new york and new jersey and a grass-roots campaign led by carol berman to continue the ban .
in spite of complaints about noise , the noise report noted that air force one , at the time a boeing vc-137 , was louder than concorde at subsonic speeds and during take-off and landing .
scheduled service from paris and london to new york's john f .
kennedy airport began on *num* november *num* .
in *num* , british airways and singapore airlines shared a concorde for flights between london and singapore international airport at paya lebar via bahrain .
the aircraft , ba's concorde g-boad , was painted in singapore airlines livery on the port side and british airways livery on the starboard side .
the service was discontinued after three return flights because of noise complaints from the malaysian government ; it could only be reinstated on a new route bypassing malaysian airspace in *num* .
a dispute with india prevented concorde from reaching supersonic speeds in indian airspace , so the route was eventually declared not viable and discontinued in *num* .
during the mexican oil boom , air france flew concorde twice weekly to mexico city's benito juárez international airport via washington , dc , or new york city , from september *num* to november *num* .
the worldwide economic crisis during that period resulted in this route's cancellation ; the last flights were almost empty .
the routing between washington or new york and mexico city included a deceleration , from mach *num* .
*num* to mach *num* .
*num* , to cross florida subsonically and avoid creating a sonic boom over the state ; concorde then re-accelerated back to high speed while crossing the gulf of mexico .
on *num* april *num* , on an around-the-world luxury tour charter , british airways implemented changes to this routing that allowed g-boaf to maintain mach *num* .
*num* by passing around florida to the east and south .
periodically concorde visited the region on similar chartered flights to mexico city and acapulco .
from december *num* to may *num* , braniff international airways leased *num* concordes , five from air france and six from british airways .
these were used on subsonic flights between dallas-fort worth and washington dulles international airport , flown by braniff flight crews .
air france and british airways crews then took over for the continuing supersonic flights to london and paris .
the aircraft were registered in both the united states and their home countries ; the european registration was covered while being operated by braniff , retaining full af / ba liveries .
the flights were not profitable and typically less than *num* % booked , forcing braniff to end its tenure as the only us concorde operator in may *num* .
in its early years , the british airways concorde service had a greater number of " no shows " ( passengers who booked a flight and then failed to appear at the gate for boarding ) than any other aircraft in the fleet .
following the launch of british airways concorde services , britain's other major airline , british caledonian ( bcal ) , set up a task force headed by gordon davidson , ba's former concorde director , to investigate the possibility of their own concorde operations .
this was seen as particularly viable for the airline's long-haul network as there were two unsold aircraft then available for purchase .
one important reason for bcal's interest in concorde was that the british government's *num* aviation policy review had opened the possibility of ba setting up supersonic services in competition with bcal's established sphere of influence .
to counteract this potential threat , bcal considered their own independent concorde plans , as well as a partnership with ba .
bcal were considered most likely to have set up a concorde service on the gatwick–lagos route , a major source of revenue and profits within bcal's scheduled route network ; bcal's concorde task force did assess the viability of a daily supersonic service complementing the existing subsonic widebody service on this route .
bcal entered into a bid to acquire at least one concorde .
however , bcal eventually arranged for two aircraft to be leased from ba and aérospatiale respectively , to be maintained by either ba or air france .
bcal's envisaged two-concorde fleet would have required a high level of aircraft usage to be cost-effective ; therefore , bcal had decided to operate the second aircraft on a supersonic service between gatwick and atlanta , with a stopover at either gander or halifax .
consideration was given to services to houston and various points on its south american network at a later stage .
both supersonic services were to be launched at some point during *num* ; however , steeply rising oil prices caused by the *num* energy crisis led to bcal shelving their supersonic ambitions .
by around *num* in the uk , the future for concorde looked bleak .
the british government had lost money operating concorde every year , and moves were afoot to cancel the service entirely .
a cost projection came back with greatly reduced metallurgical testing costs because the test rig for the wings had built up enough data to last for *num* years and could be shut down .
despite this , the government was not keen to continue .
in *num* , ba's managing director , sir john king , convinced the government to sell the aircraft outright to the then state-owned british airways for £16 .
*num* million plus the first year's profits .
british airways was subsequently privatised in *num* .
in *num* , pan american accused the british government of subsidising british airways concorde air fares , on which a return london-new york was £2 , *num* ( £ in prices ) , compared to £1 , *num* ( £ ) with a subsonic first class return , and london-washington return was £2 , *num* ( £ ) instead of £2 , *num* ( £ ) subsonic .
research revealed that passengers thought that the fare was higher than it actually was , so the airline raised ticket prices to match these perceptions .
it is reported that british airways then ran concorde at a profit .
its estimated operating costs were $3 , *num* per block hour in *num* , compared to actual *num* operating costs of $1 , *num* for a *num* and $3 , *num* for a *num* ; for a *num* , *num* nmi london–new york sector , a *num* cost $13 , *num* or *num* .
04c per seat / nmi , a *num* $26 , *num* or *num* .
4c per seat / nmi and the concorde $14 , *num* or *num* .
5c per seat / nmi .
between march *num* and march *num* , british airways flew a thrice-weekly concorde service between london and miami , stopping at washington dulles international airport .
until *num* , air france and british airways continued to operate the new york services daily .
from *num* to *num* british airways flew a saturday morning concorde service to grantley adams international airport , barbados , during the summer and winter holiday season .
prior to the air france paris crash , several uk and french tour operators operated charter flights to european destinations on a regular basis ; the charter business was viewed as lucrative by british airways and air france .
in *num* , british airways held a promotional contest to mark the *ord* anniversary of the airline's move into the private sector .
the promotion was a lottery to fly to new york held for *num* tickets valued at £5 , *num* each , to be offered at £10 .
contestants had to call a special hotline to compete with up to *num* million people .
on *num* april *num* , air france and british airways simultaneously announced they would retire concorde later that year .
they cited low passenger numbers following the *num* july *num* crash , the slump in air travel following the september *num* attacks , and rising maintenance costs : airbus ( the company that acquired aerospatiale in *num* ) had made a decision in *num* to no longer supply replacement parts for the aircraft .
although concorde was technologically advanced when introduced in the 1970s , *num* years later , its analogue cockpit was outdated .
there had been little commercial pressure to upgrade concorde due to a lack of competing aircraft , unlike other airliners of the same era such as the boeing *num* .
by its retirement , it was the last aircraft in the british airways fleet that had a flight engineer ; other aircraft , such as the modernised 747-400 , had eliminated the role .
on *num* april *num* , virgin atlantic founder sir richard branson announced that the company was interested in purchasing british airways ' concorde fleet " for the same price that they were given them for – one pound " .
british airways dismissed the idea , prompting virgin to increase their offer to £1 million each .
branson claimed that when ba was privatised , a clause in the agreement required them to allow another british airline to operate concorde if ba ceased to do so , but the government denied the existence of such a clause .
in october *num* , branson wrote in " the economist " that his final offer was " over £5 million " and that he had intended to operate the fleet " for many years to come " .
the chances for keeping concorde in service were stifled by airbus's lack of support for continued maintenance .
it has been suggested that concorde was not withdrawn for the reasons usually given but that it became apparent during the grounding of concorde that the airlines could make more profit carrying first-class passengers subsonically .
a lack of commitment to concorde from director of engineering alan macdonald was cited as having undermined ba's resolve to continue operating concorde .
other reasons why the attempted revival of concorde never happened relate to the fact that the narrow fuselage did not allow for " luxury " features of subsonic air travel such as moving space , reclining seats and overall comfort .
in the words of " the guardian"'s dave hall , " concorde was an outdated notion of prestige that left sheer speed the only luxury of supersonic travel .
" air france made its final commercial concorde landing in the united states in new york city from paris on *num* may *num* .
air france's final concorde flight took place on *num* june *num* when f-bvfc retired to toulouse .
an auction of concorde parts and memorabilia for air france was held at christie's in paris on *num* november *num* ; *num* , *num* people attended , and several lots exceeded their predicted values .
french concorde f-bvfc was retired to toulouse and kept functional for a short time after the end of service , in case taxi runs were required in support of the french judicial enquiry into the *num* crash .
the aircraft is now fully retired and no longer functional .
french concorde f-btsd has been retired to the " musée de l'air " at paris–le bourget airport near paris ; unlike the other museum concordes , a few of the systems are being kept functional .
for instance , the famous " droop nose " can still be lowered and raised .
this led to rumours that they could be prepared for future flights for special occasions .
french concorde f-bvfb is at the auto & technik museum sinsheim at sinsheim , germany , after its last flight from paris to baden-baden , followed by a spectacular transport to sinsheim via barge and road .
the museum also has a tupolev tu-144 on display – this is the only place where both supersonic airliners can be seen together .
in *num* , air france signed a letter of agreement to donate a concorde to the national air and space museum in washington d .
c .
upon the aircraft's retirement .
on *num* june *num* , air france honoured that agreement , donating concorde f-bvfa ( serial *num* ) to the museum upon the completion of its last flight .
this aircraft was the first air france concorde to open service to rio de janeiro , washington , d .
c .
, and new york and had flown *num* , *num* hours .
it is on display at the smithsonian's steven f .
udvar-hazy center at dulles airport .
british airways conducted a north american farewell tour in october *num* .
g-boag visited toronto pearson international airport on *num* october , after which it flew to new york's john f .
kennedy international airport .
g-boad visited boston's logan international airport on *num* october , and g-boag visited washington dulles international airport on *num* october .
in a week of farewell flights around the united kingdom , concorde visited birmingham on *num* october , belfast on *num* october , manchester on *num* october , cardiff on *num* october , and edinburgh on *num* october .
each day the aircraft made a return flight out and back into heathrow to the cities , often overflying them at low altitude .
on *num* october , both concorde flight ba9021c , a special from manchester , and ba002 from new york landed simultaneously on both of heathrow's runways .
on *num* october *num* , the queen consented to the illumination of windsor castle , an honour reserved for state events and visiting dignitaries , as concorde's last west-bound commercial flight departed london .
british airways retired its concorde fleet on *num* october *num* .
g-boag left new york to a fanfare similar to that given for air france's f-btsd , while two more made round trips , g-boaf over the bay of biscay , carrying vip guests including former concorde pilots , and g-boae to edinburgh .
the three aircraft then circled over london , having received special permission to fly at low altitude , before landing in sequence at heathrow .
the captain of the new york to london flight was mike bannister .
the final flight of a concorde in the us occurred on *num* november *num* when g-boag flew from new york's jfk airport to seattle's boeing field to join the museum of flight's permanent collection .
the plane was piloted by mike bannister and les broadie , who claimed a flight time of three hours , *num* minutes and *num* seconds , a record between the two cities .
the museum had been pursuing a concorde for their collection since *num* .
the final flight of a concorde worldwide took place on *num* november *num* with a landing at filton , bristol , uk .
all of ba's concorde fleet have been grounded , drained of hydraulic fluid and their airworthiness certificates withdrawn .
jock lowe , ex-chief concorde pilot and manager of the fleet estimated in *num* that it would cost £10–15 million to make g-boaf airworthy again .
ba maintain ownership and have stated that they will not fly again due to a lack of support from airbus .
on *num* december *num* , bonhams held an auction of british airways concorde artefacts , including a nose cone , at kensington olympia in london .
proceeds of around £750 , *num* were raised , with the majority going to charity .
g-boad is currently on display at the intrepid sea , air & space museum in new york .
in *num* , ba announced that the advertising spot at heathrow where a *num* % scale model of concorde was located would not be retained ; the model is now on display at the brooklands museum , in surrey , england .
although only used for spares after being retired from test flying and trials work in *num* , concorde g-bbdg was dismantled and transported by road from filton then restored from essentially a shell at the brooklands museum in surrey , where it remains open to visitors to the museum .
concorde " g-boab " , nicknamed " alpha bravo " , was never modified and returned to service with the rest of british airways ' fleet , and has remained at london heathrow airport since its final flight in *num* , a ferry flight from jfk .
the aircraft has been moved around the apron at heathrow several times , and can be regularly seen from other aircraft departing or arriving at the airport .
g-boab is also occasionally used by ba for apprentice training .
one of the youngest concordes ( f-btsd ) is on display at le bourget air and space museum in paris .
in february *num* , it was announced that the museum and a group of volunteer air france technicians intend to restore f-btsd so it can taxi under its own power .
in may *num* , it was reported that the british save concorde group and french olympus *num* groups had begun inspecting the engines of a concorde at the french museum ; their intent is to restore the airliner to a condition where it can fly in demonstrations .
save concorde group hoped to get f-btsd flying for the *num* london olympics , but this never happened .
the work for restoring f-btsd to operating condition is currently not very well known , and it is still being housed in le bourget as a museum exhibit .
in *num* , the organisation club concorde announced that it had raised funds of £120 million for a static display and to buy the concorde at le bourget , restore it and return it to service as a heritage aircraft for air displays and charter hire by *num* , to coincide with the *ord* anniversary of concorde's first flight .
g-boaf forms the centrepiece of the aerospace bristol museum at filton , which opened to the public in *num* .
on *num* september *num* , club concorde announced it had secured over £160 million to return an aircraft to service .
club concorde president paul james said : the organisation aims to buy the concorde currently on display at le bourget airport .
a tentative date of *num* has been put forward for the return to flight—50 years after its maiden journey .
however , due to regulatory and technical hurdles , some of the aviation community are highly skeptical of the plan , including former concorde captain and club concorde co-founder william " jock " lowe , who was quoted in june *num* saying : on *num* july *num* , air france flight *num* , registration f-btsc , crashed in gonesse , france after departing from paris-charles de gaulle en route to john f .
kennedy international airport in new york city , killing all *num* passengers and *num* crew members on board the flight , and *num* people on the ground .
it was the only fatal accident involving concorde .
according to the official investigation conducted by the " bureau d'enquêtes et d'analyses pour la sécurité de l'aviation civile " ( bea ) , the crash was caused by a metallic strip that had fallen from a continental airlines dc-10 that had taken off minutes earlier .
this fragment punctured a tyre on concorde's left main wheel bogie during take-off .
the tyre exploded , and a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank , which caused a fuel leak and led to a fire .
the crew shut down engine number *num* in response to a fire warning , and with engine number *num* surging and producing little power , the aircraft was unable to gain altitude or speed .
the aircraft entered a rapid pitch-up then a sudden descent , rolling left and crashing tail-low into the hôtelissimo les relais bleus hotel in gonesse .
the claim that a metallic strip caused the crash was disputed during the trial both by witnesses ( including the pilot of then french president jacques chirac's aircraft that had just landed on an adjacent runway when flight *num* caught fire ) and by an independent french tv investigation that found a wheel spacer had not been installed in the left-side main gear and that the plane caught fire some *num* , *num* feet from where the metallic strip lay .
british investigators and former french concorde pilots looked at several other possibilities that the bea report ignored , including an unbalanced weight distribution in the fuel tanks and loose landing gear .
they came to the conclusion that the concorde veered off course on the runway , which reduced takeoff speed below the crucial minimum .
john hutchinson , who had served as a concorde captain for *num* years with british airways , said " the fire on its own should have been ' eminently survivable ; the pilot should have been able to fly his way out of trouble' " , had it not been for a " lethal combination of operational error and ' negligence ' by the maintenance department of air france " that " nobody wants to talk about " .
on *num* december *num* , continental airlines and john taylor , a mechanic who installed the metal strip , were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter , but on *num* november *num* , a french court overturned the conviction , saying mistakes by continental and taylor did not make them criminally responsible .
prior to the accident , concorde had been arguably the safest operational passenger airliner in the world in passenger deaths-per-kilometres travelled with zero , but there had been two prior non-fatal accidents and a rate of tyre damage some *num* times higher than subsonic airliners from *num* to *num* .
safety improvements were made in the wake of the crash , including more secure electrical controls , kevlar lining on the fuel tanks and specially developed burst-resistant tyres .
the first flight with the modifications departed from london heathrow on *num* july *num* , piloted by ba chief concorde pilot mike bannister .
during the 3-hour 20-minute flight over the mid-atlantic towards iceland , bannister attained mach *num* .
*num* and before returning to raf brize norton .
the test flight , intended to resemble the london–new york route , was declared a success and was watched on live tv , and by crowds on the ground at both locations .
the first flight with passengers after the accident took place on *num* september *num* , landing shortly before the world trade center attacks in the us .
this was not a commercial flight : all the passengers were ba employees .
normal commercial operations resumed on *num* november *num* by ba and af ( aircraft g-boae and f-btsd ) , with service to new york jfk , where mayor rudy giuliani greeted the passengers .
concorde had suffered two previous non-fatal accidents that were similar to each other .
of the twenty aircraft built , *num* are still complete .
many are on display at museums in the united kingdom , france , the united states , germany and barbados .
the only supersonic airliner in direct competition with concorde was the soviet tupolev tu-144 , nicknamed " concordski " by western european journalists for its outward similarity to concorde .
it had been alleged that soviet espionage efforts had resulted in the theft of concorde blueprints , supposedly to assist in the design of the tu-144 .
as a result of a rushed development programme , the first tu-144 prototype was substantially different from the preproduction machines , but both were cruder than concorde .
the tu-144"s " had a significantly shorter range than concorde .
jean rech , sud aviation , attributed this to two things , a very heavy powerplant with an intake twice as long as that on concorde , and low-bypass turbofan engines with too-high a bypass ratio which needed afterburning for cruise .
the aircraft had poor control at low speeds because of a simpler supersonic wing design ; in addition the tu-144 required braking parachutes to land while concorde used anti-lock brakes .
the tu-144 had two crashes , one at the *num* paris air show , and another during a pre-delivery test flight in may *num* .
later production tu-144 versions were more refined and competitive .
they had retractable canards for better low-speed control , turbojet engines providing nearly the fuel efficiency and range of concorde and a top speed of mach *num* .
*num* .
passenger service commenced in november *num* , but after the *num* crash the aircraft was taken out of passenger service after only *num* flights , which carried an average of *num* passengers .
the aircraft had an inherently unsafe structural design as a consequence of an automated production method chosen to simplify and speed up manufacturing .
the american designs , the " sst " project ( for supersonic transport ) were the boeing *num* and the lockheed l-2000 .
these were to have been larger , with seating for up to *num* people .
running a few years behind concorde , the boeing *num* was redesigned to a cropped delta layout ; the extra cost of these changes helped to kill the project .
the operation of us military aircraft such as the mach 3+ north american xb-70 valkyrie prototypes and convair b-58 hustler strategic nuclear bomber had shown that sonic booms were quite capable of reaching the ground , and the experience from the oklahoma city sonic boom tests led to the same environmental concerns that hindered the commercial success of concorde .
the american government cancelled its sst project in *num* , after having spent more than $1 billion .
the only other large supersonic aircraft comparable to concorde are strategic bombers , principally the russian tu-22 , tu-22m , m-50 ( experimental ) , t-4 ( experimental ) , tu-160 and the american xb-70 ( experimental ) and b-1 .
before concorde's flight trials , developments in the civil aviation industry were largely accepted by governments and their respective electorates .
opposition to concorde's noise , particularly on the east coast of the united states , forged a new political agenda on both sides of the atlantic , with scientists and technology experts across a multitude of industries beginning to take the environmental and social impact more seriously .
although concorde led directly to the introduction of a general noise abatement programme for aircraft flying out of john f .
kennedy airport , many found that concorde was quieter than expected , partly due to the pilots temporarily throttling back their engines to reduce noise during overflight of residential areas .
even before commercial flights started , it had been claimed that concorde was quieter than many other aircraft .
in *num* , bac's technical director was quoted as saying , " it is certain on present evidence and calculations that in the airport context , production concordes will be no worse than aircraft now in service and will in fact be better than many of them .
" concorde produced nitrogen oxides in its exhaust , which , despite complicated interactions with other ozone-depleting chemicals , are understood to result in degradation to the ozone layer at the stratospheric altitudes it cruised .
it has been pointed out that other , lower-flying , airliners produce ozone during their flights in the troposphere , but vertical transit of gases between the layers is restricted .
the small fleet meant overall ozone-layer degradation caused by concorde was negligible .
in *num* , david fahey , of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in the united states , warned that a fleet of *num* supersonic aircraft with exhausts similar to concorde might produce a *num* percent drop in global ozone levels , much higher than previously thought .
each *num* percent drop in ozone is estimated to increase the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer worldwide by *num* percent .
dr fahey said if these particles are produced by highly oxidised sulphur in the fuel , as he believed , then removing sulphur in the fuel will reduce the ozone-destroying impact of supersonic transport .
concorde's technical leap forward boosted the public's understanding of conflicts between technology and the environment as well as awareness of the complex decision analysis processes that surround such conflicts .
in france , the use of acoustic fencing alongside tgv tracks might not have been achieved without the 1970s controversy over aircraft noise .
in the uk , the cpre has issued tranquillity maps since *num* .
some sources say concorde typically flew per passenger .
concorde was normally perceived as a privilege of the rich , but special circular or one-way ( with return by other flight or ship ) charter flights were arranged to bring a trip within the means of moderately well-off enthusiasts .
the aircraft was usually referred to by the british as simply " concorde " .
in france it was known as " le concorde " due to " le " , the definite article , used in french grammar to introduce the name of a ship or aircraft , and the capital being used to distinguish a proper name from a common noun of the same spelling .
in french , the common noun " concorde " means " agreement , harmony , or peace " .
concorde's pilots and british airways in official publications often refer to concorde both in the singular and plural as " she " or " her " .
as a symbol of national pride , an example from the ba fleet made occasional flypasts at selected royal events , major air shows and other special occasions , sometimes in formation with the red arrows .
on the final day of commercial service , public interest was so great that grandstands were erected at heathrow airport .
significant numbers of people attended the final landings ; the event received widespread media coverage .
in *num* , *num* years after its first test flight , concorde was announced the winner of the great british design quest organised by the bbc and the design museum .
a total of *num* , *num* votes were cast with concorde beating other british design icons such as the mini , mini skirt , jaguar e-type , tube map , the world wide web , k2 telephone box and the supermarine spitfire .
the heads of france and the united kingdom flew concorde many times .
presidents georges pompidou , valéry giscard d'estaing and françois mitterrand regularly used concorde as french flagman aircraft in foreign visits .
queen elizabeth ii and prime ministers edward heath , jim callaghan , margaret thatcher , john major and tony blair took concorde in some charter flights such as the queen's trips to barbados on her silver jubilee in *num* , in *num* and in *num* , to the middle east in *num* and to the united states in *num* .
pope john paul ii flew on concorde in may *num* .
concorde sometimes made special flights for demonstrations , air shows ( such as the farnborough , paris-lebourget , oshkosh airventure and maks air shows ) as well as parades and celebrations ( for example , of zürich airport's anniversary in *num* ) .
the aircraft were also used for private charters ( including by the president of zaire mobutu sese seko on multiple occasions ) , for advertising companies ( including for the firm oki ) , for olympic torch relays ( *num* winter olympics in albertville ) and for observing solar eclipses , including the solar eclipse of june *num* , *num* and again for the total solar eclipse on august *num* , *num* .
the fastest transatlantic airliner flight was from new york jfk to london heathrow on *num* february *num* by the british airways g-boad in *num* hours , *num* minutes , *num* seconds from take-off to touchdown aided by a *num* mph ( *num* km / h ) tailwind .
on *num* february *num* , a concorde charter flight flew from london heathrow to sydney—on the opposite side of the world—in a time of *num* hours , *num* minutes and *num* seconds , including refuelling stops .
concorde also set other records , including the official fai " westbound around the world " and " eastbound around the world " world air speed records .
on 12–13 october *num* , in commemoration of the *ord* anniversary of columbus ' first new world landing , concorde spirit tours ( us ) chartered air france concorde f-btsd and circumnavigated the world in *num* hours *num* minutes and *num* seconds , from lisbon , portugal , including six refuelling stops at santo domingo , acapulco , honolulu , guam , bangkok , and bahrain .
the eastbound record was set by the same air france concorde ( f-btsd ) under charter to concorde spirit tours in the us on 15–16 august *num* .
this promotional flight circumnavigated the world from new york / jfk international airport in *num* hours *num* minutes *num* seconds , including six refuelling stops at toulouse , dubai , bangkok , andersen afb in guam , honolulu , and acapulco .
by its *ord* flight anniversary on *num* march *num* concorde had clocked up *num* , *num* flight hours , with more than *num* , *num* supersonic , many more than all of the other supersonic aircraft in the western world combined .
on its way to the museum of flight in november *num* , g-boag set a new york city-to-seattle speed record of *num* hours , *num* minutes , and *num* seconds .
due to the restrictions on supersonic overflights within the us the flight was granted permission by the canadian authorities for the majority of the journey to be flown supersonically over sparsely-populated canadian territory .
creation science creation science or scientific creationism is a branch of creationism that claims to provide scientific support for the genesis creation narrative in the book of genesis and disprove or reexplain the scientific facts , theories and paradigms about geology , cosmology , biological evolution , archeology , history , and linguistics .
the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community is that creation science fails to produce scientific hypotheses , and courts have ruled that it is a religious , not a scientific , view .
it fails to qualify as a science because it lacks empirical support , supplies no tentative hypotheses , and resolves to describe natural history in terms of scientifically untestable supernatural causes .
creation science is a pseudoscientific attempt to map the bible into scientific facts .
it is viewed by professional biologists as unscholarly , and even as a dishonest and misguided sham , with extremely harmful educational consequences .
creation science began in the 1960s , as a fundamentalist christian effort in the united states to prove biblical inerrancy and nullify the scientific evidence for evolution .
it has since developed a sizable religious following in the united states , with creation science ministries branching worldwide .
the main ideas in creation science are : the belief in " creation " ex nihilo" " ( latin : out of nothing ) ; the conviction that the earth was created within the last *num* , 000–10 , *num* years ; the belief that humans and other life on earth were created as distinct fixed " baraminological " " kinds " ; and the idea that fossils found in geological strata were deposited during a cataclysmic flood which completely covered the entire earth .
as a result , creation science also challenges the commonly accepted geologic and astrophysical theories for the age and origins of the earth and universe , which creationists believe are irreconcilable with the account in the book of genesis .
creation science proponents often refer to the theory of evolution as " darwinism " or as " darwinian evolution .
" the creation science texts and curricula that first emerged in the 1960s focused upon concepts derived from a literal interpretation of the bible and were overtly religious in nature , most notably linking noah's flood in the biblical genesis account to the geological and fossil record in a system termed flood geology .
these works attracted little notice beyond the schools and congregations of conservative fundamental and evangelical christians until the 1970s , when its followers challenged the teaching of evolution in the public schools and other venues in the united states , bringing it to the attention of the public-at-large and the scientific community .
many school boards and lawmakers were persuaded to include the teaching of creation science alongside evolution in the science curriculum .
creation science texts and curricula used in churches and christian schools were revised to eliminate their biblical and theological references , and less explicitly sectarian versions of creation science education were introduced in public schools in louisiana , arkansas , and other regions in the united states .
the *num* ruling in " mclean v .
arkansas " found that creation science fails to meet the essential characteristics of science and that its chief intent is to advance a particular religious view .
the teaching of creation science in public schools in the united states effectively ended in *num* following the united states supreme court decision in " edwards v .
aguillard " .
the court affirmed that a statute requiring the teaching of creation science alongside evolution when evolution is taught in louisiana public schools was unconstitutional because its sole true purpose was to advance a particular religious belief .
in response to this ruling , drafts of the creation science school textbook " of pandas and people " were edited to change references of creation to intelligent design before its publication in *num* .
the intelligent design movement promoted this version .
requiring intelligent design to be taught in public school science classes was found to be unconstitutional in the *num* " kitzmiller v .
dover area school district " federal court case .
creation science is based largely upon chapters 1–11 of the book of genesis .
these describe how god calls the world into existence through the power of speech ( " and god said , let there be light , " etc .
) in six days , calls all the animals and plants into existence , and molds the first man from clay and the first woman from a rib taken from the man's side ; a worldwide flood destroys all life except for noah and his family and representatives of the animals , and noah becomes the ancestor of the *num* " nations " of the world ; the nations live together until the incident of the tower of babel , when god disperses them and gives them their different languages .
creation science attempts to explain history and science within the span of biblical chronology , which places the initial act of creation some six thousand years ago .
most creation science proponents hold fundamentalist or evangelical christian beliefs in biblical literalism or biblical inerrancy , as opposed to the higher criticism supported by liberal christianity in the fundamentalist–modernist controversy .
however , there are also examples of islamic and jewish scientific creationism that conform to the accounts of creation as recorded in their religious doctrines .
the seventh-day adventist church has a history of support for creation science .
this dates back to george mccready price , an active seventh-day adventist who developed views of flood geology , which formed the basis of creation science .
this work was continued by the geoscience research institute , an official institute of the seventh-day adventist church , located on its loma linda university campus in california .
creation science is generally rejected by the church of england as well as the roman catholic church .
the pontifical gregorian university has officially discussed intelligent design as a " cultural phenomenon " without scientific elements .
the church of england's official website cites charles darwin's local work assisting people in his religious parish .
creation science rejects evolution's theory of the common descent of all living things on the earth .
instead , it asserts that the field of evolutionary biology is itself pseudoscientific or even a religion .
creationists argue instead for a system called baraminology , which considers the living world to be descended from uniquely created kinds or " baramins .
" creation science incorporates the concept of catastrophism to reconcile current landforms and fossil distributions with biblical interpretations , proposing the remains resulted from successive cataclysmic events , such as a worldwide flood and subsequent ice age .
it rejects one of the fundamental principles of modern geology ( and of modern science generally ) , uniformitarianism , which applies the same physical and geological laws observed on the earth today to interpret the earth's geological history .
sometimes creationists attack other scientific concepts , like the big bang cosmological model or methods of scientific dating based upon radioactive decay .
young earth creationists also reject current estimates of the age of the universe and the age of the earth , arguing for creationist cosmologies with timescales much shorter than those determined by modern physical cosmology and geological science , typically less than *num* , *num* years .
the scientific community has overwhelmingly rejected the ideas put forth in creation science as lying outside the boundaries of a legitimate science .
the foundational premises underlying scientific creationism disqualify it as a science because the answers to all inquiry therein are preordained to conform to bible doctrine , and because that inquiry is constructed upon theories which are not empirically testable in nature .
scientists also deem creation science's attacks against biological evolution to be without scientific merit .
those views of the scientific community were accepted in two significant court decisions in the 1980s which found the field of creation science to be a religious mode of inquiry , not a scientific one .
the teaching of evolution was gradually introduced into more and more public high school textbooks in the united states after *num* , but in the aftermath of the first world war the growth of fundamentalist christianity gave rise to a creationist opposition to such teaching .
legislation prohibiting the teaching of evolution was passed in certain regions , most notably tennessee's butler act of *num* .
the soviet union's successful launch of " sputnik *num* " in *num* sparked national concern that the science education in public schools was outdated .
in *num* , the united states passed national defense education act which introduced new education guidelines for science instruction .
with federal grant funding , the biological sciences curriculum study ( bscs ) drafted new standards for the public schools ' science textbooks which included the teaching of evolution .
almost half the nation's high schools were using textbooks based on the guidelines of the bscs soon after they were published in *num* .
the tennessee legislature did not repeal the butler act until *num* .
creation science ( dubbed " scientific creationism " at the time ) emerged as an organized movement during the 1960s .
it was strongly influenced by the earlier work of armchair geologist george mccready price who wrote works such as " the new geology " ( *num* ) to advance what he termed " new catastrophism " and dispute the current geological time frames and explanations of geologic history .
price's work was cited at the scopes trial of *num* , yet although he frequently solicited feedback from geologists and other scientists , they consistently disparaged his work .
price's " new catastrophism " also went largely unnoticed by other creationists until its revival with the *num* publication of " " by john c .
whitcomb and henry m .
morris , a work which quickly became an important text on the issue to fundamentalist christians and expanded the field of creation science beyond critiques of geology into biology and cosmology as well .
soon after its publication , a movement was underway to have the subject taught in united states ' public schools .
the various state laws prohibiting teaching of evolution were overturned in *num* when the united states supreme court ruled in " epperson v .
arkansas " such laws violated the establishment clause of the first amendment to the united states constitution .
this ruling inspired a new creationist movement to promote laws requiring that schools give balanced treatment to creation science when evolution is taught .
the *num* arkansas act *num* was one such law that carefully detailed the principles of creation science that were to receive equal time in public schools alongside evolutionary principles .
the act defined creation science as follows : "'creation-science ' means the scientific evidences for creation and inferences from those evidences .
creation-science includes the scientific evidences and related inferences that indicate : this legislation was examined in " mclean v .
arkansas " , and the ruling handed down on january *num* , *num* , concluded that creation-science as defined in the act " is simply not science " .
the judgement defined the following as essential characteristics of science : the court ruled that creation science failed to meet these essential characteristics and identified specific reasons .
after examining the key concepts from creation science , the court found : the court further noted that no recognized scientific journal had published any article espousing the creation science theory as described in the arkansas law , and stated that the testimony presented by defense attributing the absence to censorship was not credible .
in its ruling , the court wrote that for any theory to qualify as scientific , the theory must be tentative , and open to revision or abandonment as new facts come to light .
it wrote that any methodology which begins with an immutable conclusion which cannot be revised or rejected , regardless of the evidence , is not a scientific theory .
the court found that creation science does not culminate in conclusions formed from scientific inquiry , but instead begins with the conclusion , one taken from a literal wording of the book of genesis , and seeks only scientific evidence to support it .
the law in arkansas adopted the same two-model approach as that put forward by the institute for creation research , one allowing only two possible explanations for the origins of life and existence of man , plants and animals : it was either the work of a creator or it was not .
scientific evidence that failed to support the theory of evolution was posed as necessarily scientific evidence in support of creationism , but in its judgment the court ruled this approach to be no more than a " contrived dualism which has not scientific factual basis or legitimate educational purpose .
" the judge concluded that " act *num* is a religious crusade , coupled with a desire to conceal this fact , " and that it violated the first amendment's establishment clause .
the decision was not appealed to a higher court , but had a powerful influence on subsequent rulings .
louisiana's *num* balanced treatment for creation-science and evolution-science act , authored by state senator bill p .
keith , judged in the *num* united states supreme court case " edwards v .
aguillard " , and was handed a similar ruling .
it found the law to require the balanced teaching of creation science with evolution had a particular religious purpose and was therefore unconstitutional .
in *num* , " the mystery of life's origin " was first published .
it was co-authored by chemist and creationist charles b .
thaxton with walter l .
bradley and roger l .
olsen , the foreword written by dean h .
kenyon , and sponsored by the christian-based foundation for thought and ethics ( fte ) .
the work presented scientific arguments against current theories of abiogenesis and offered an hypothesis of special creation instead .
while the focus of creation science had until that time centered primarily on the criticism of the fossil evidence for evolution and validation of the creation myth of the bible , this new work posed the question whether science reveals that even the simplest living systems were far too complex to have developed by natural , unguided processes .
kenyon later co-wrote with creationist percival davis a book intended as a " scientific brief for creationism " to use as a supplement to public high school biology textbooks .
thaxton was enlisted as the book's editor , and the book received publishing support from the fte .
prior to its release , the *num* supreme court ruling in " edwards v .
aguillard " barred the teaching of creation science and creationism in public school classrooms .
the book , originally titled " biology and creation " but renamed " of pandas and people " , was released in *num* and became the first published work to promote the anti-evolutionist design argument under the name intelligent design .
the contents of the book later became a focus of evidence in the federal court case , " kitzmiller v .
dover area school district " , when a group of parents filed suit to halt the teaching of intelligent design in dover , pennsylvania , public schools .
school board officials there had attempted to include " of pandas and people " in their biology classrooms and testimony given during the trial revealed the book was originally written as a creationist text but following the adverse decision in the supreme court it underwent simple cosmetic editing to remove the explicit allusions to " creation " or " creator , " and replace them instead with references to " design " or " designer .
" by the mid-1990s , intelligent design had become a separate movement .
the creation science movement is distinguished from the intelligent design movement , or neo-creationism , because most advocates of creation science accept scripture as a literal and inerrant historical account , and their primary goal is to corroborate the scriptural account through the use of science .
in contrast , as a matter of principle , neo-creationism eschews references to scripture altogether in its polemics and stated goals ( see wedge strategy ) .
by so doing , intelligent design proponents have attempted to succeed where creation science has failed in securing a place in public school science curricula .
carefully avoiding any reference to the identity of the intelligent designer as god in their public arguments , intelligent design proponents sought to reintroduce the creationist ideas into science classrooms while sidestepping the first amendment's prohibition against religious infringement .
however , the intelligent design curriculum was struck down as a violation of the establishment clause in " kitzmiller v .
dover area school district " , the judge in the case ruling " that id is nothing less than the progeny of creationism .
" today , creation science as an organized movement is primarily centered within the united states .
creation science organizations are also known in other countries , most notably creation ministries international which was founded ( under the name creation science foundation ) in australia .
proponents are usually aligned with a christian denomination , primarily with those characterized as evangelical , conservative , or fundamentalist .
while creationist movements also exist in islam and judaism , these movements do not use the phrase " creation science " to describe their beliefs .
creation science has its roots in the work of young earth creationist george mccready price disputing modern science's account of natural history , focusing particularly on geology and its concept of uniformitarianism , and his efforts instead to furnish an alternative empirical explanation of observable phenomena which was compatible with strict biblical literalism .
price's work was later discovered by civil engineer henry m .
morris , who is now considered to be the father of creation science .
morris and later creationists expanded the scope with attacks against the broad spectrum scientific findings that point to the antiquity of the universe and common ancestry among species , including growing body of evidence from the fossil record , absolute dating techniques , and cosmogony .
the proponents of creation science often say that they are concerned with religious and moral questions as well as natural observations and predictive hypotheses .
many state that their opposition to scientific evolution is primarily based on religion .
the overwhelming majority of scientists are in agreement that the claims of science are necessarily limited to those that develop from natural observations and experiments which can be replicated and substantiated by other scientists , and that claims made by creation science do not meet those criteria .
duane gish , a prominent creation science proponent , has similarly claimed , " we do not know how the creator created , what processes he used , " for he used processes which are not now operating anywhere in the natural universe .
" this is why we refer to creation as special creation .
we cannot discover by scientific investigation anything about the creative processes used by the creator .
" but he also makes the same claim against science's evolutionary theory , maintaining that on the subject of origins , scientific evolution is a religious theory which cannot be validated by science .
creation science makes the " a priori " metaphysical assumption that there exists a creator of the life whose origin is being examined .
christian creation science holds that the description of creation is given in the bible , that the bible is inerrant in this description ( and elsewhere ) , and therefore empirical scientific evidence must correspond with that description .
creationists also view the preclusion of all supernatural explanations within the sciences as a doctrinaire commitment to exclude the supreme being and miracles .
they claim this to be the motivating factor in science's acceptance of darwinism , a term used in creation science to refer to evolutionary biology which is also often used as a disparagement .
critics argue that creation science is religious rather than scientific because it stems from faith in a religious text rather than by the application of the scientific method .
the united states national academy of sciences ( nas ) has stated unequivocally , " evolution pervades all biological phenomena .
to ignore that it occurred or to classify it as a form of dogma is to deprive the student of the most fundamental organizational concept in the biological sciences .
no other biological concept has been more extensively tested and more thoroughly corroborated than the evolutionary history of organisms .
" anthropologist eugenie scott has noted further , " religious opposition to evolution propels antievolutionism .
although antievolutionists pay lip service to supposed scientific problems with evolution , what motivates them to battle its teaching is apprehension over the implications of evolution for religion .
" creation science advocates argue that scientific theories of the origins of the universe , earth , and life are rooted in " a priori " presumptions of methodological naturalism and uniformitarianism , each of which is disputed .
in some areas of science such as chemistry , meteorology or medicine , creation science proponents do not challenge the application of naturalistic or uniformitarian assumptions .
traditionally , creation science advocates have singled out those scientific theories judged to be in conflict with held religious beliefs , and it is against those theories that they concentrate their efforts .
many mainstream christian churches criticize creation science on theological grounds , asserting either that religious faith alone should be a sufficient basis for belief in the truth of creation , or that efforts to prove the genesis account of creation on scientific grounds are inherently futile because reason is subordinate to faith and cannot thus be used to prove it .
many christian theologies , including liberal christianity , consider the genesis creation narrative to be a poetic and allegorical work rather than a literal history , and many christian churches—including the eastern orthodox church , the roman catholic , anglican and the more liberal denominations of the lutheran , methodist , congregationalist and presbyterian faiths—have either rejected creation science outright or are ambivalent to it .
belief in non-literal interpretations of genesis is often cited as going back to saint augustine .
theistic evolution and evolutionary creationism are theologies that reconcile belief in a creator with biological evolution .
each holds the view that there is a creator but that this creator has employed the natural force of evolution to unfold a divine plan .
religious representatives from faiths compatible with theistic evolution and evolutionary creationism have challenged the growing perception that belief in a creator is inconsistent with the acceptance of evolutionary theory .
spokespersons from the catholic church have specifically criticized biblical creationism for relying upon literal interpretations of biblical scripture as the basis for determining scientific fact .
the national academy of sciences states that " the claims of creation science lack empirical support and cannot be meaningfully tested " and that " creation science is in fact not science and should not be presented as such in science classes .
" according to joyce arthur writing for " skeptic " magazine , the " creation ' science ' movement gains much of its strength through the use of distortion and scientifically unethical tactics " and " seriously misrepresents the theory of evolution .
" scientists have considered the hypotheses proposed by creation science and have rejected them because of a lack of evidence .
furthermore , the claims of creation science do not refer to natural causes and cannot be subject to meaningful tests , so they do not qualify as scientific hypotheses .
in *num* , the united states supreme court ruled that creationism is religion , not science , and cannot be advocated in public school classrooms .
most mainline christian denominations have concluded that the concept of evolution is not at odds with their descriptions of creation and human origins .
a summary of the objections to creation science by scientists follows : by invoking claims of " abrupt appearance " of species as a miraculous act , creation science is unsuited for the tools and methods demanded by science , and it cannot be considered scientific in the way that the term " science " is currently defined .
scientists and science writers commonly characterize creation science as a pseudoscience .
historically , the debate of whether creationism is compatible with science can be traced back to *num* , the year science historian john william draper published his " history of the conflict between religion and science " .
in it draper portrayed the entire history of scientific development as a war against religion .
this presentation of history was propagated further by followers such as andrew dickson white in his two-volume " a history of the warfare of science with theology in christendom " ( *num* ) .
their conclusions have been disputed .
in the united states , the principal focus of creation science advocates is on the government-supported public school systems , which are prohibited by the establishment clause from promoting specific religions .
historical communities have argued that biblical translations contain many translation errors and errata , and therefore that the use of biblical literalism in creation science is self-contradictory .
creationist biology centers on an idea derived from genesis that states that life was created by god , in a finite number of " created kinds , " rather than through biological evolution from a common ancestor .
creationists consider that any observable speciation descends from these distinctly created kinds through inbreeding , deleterious mutations and other genetic mechanisms .
whereas evolutionary biologists and creationists share similar views of microevolution , creationists disagree that the process of macroevolution can explain common ancestry among organisms far beyond the level of common species .
creationists contend that there is no empirical evidence for new plant or animal species , and deny fossil evidence has ever been found documenting the process .
popular arguments against evolution have changed since the publishing of henry m .
morris ' first book on the subject , " scientific creationism " ( *num* ) , but some consistent themes remain : that missing links or gaps in the fossil record are proof against evolution ; that the increased complexity of organisms over time through evolution is not possible due to the law of increasing entropy ; that it is impossible that the mechanism of natural selection could account for common ancestry ; and that evolutionary theory is untestable .
the origin of the human species is particularly hotly contested ; the fossil remains of purported hominid ancestors are not considered by advocates of creation biology to be evidence for a speciation event involving " homo sapiens " .
creationists also assert that early hominids , are either apes , or humans .
richard dawkins has explained evolution as " a theory of gradual , incremental change over millions of years , which starts with something very simple and works up along slow , gradual gradients to greater complexity , " and described the existing fossil record as entirely consistent with that process .
biologists emphasize that transitional gaps between those fossils recovered are to be expected , that the existence of any such gaps cannot be invoked to disprove evolution , and that instead the fossil evidence that could be used to disprove the theory would be those fossils which are found and which are entirely inconsistent with what can be predicted or anticipated by the evolutionary model .
one example given by dawkins was , " if there were a single hippo or rabbit in the precambrian , that would completely blow evolution out of the water .
none have ever been found .
" flood geology is a concept based on the belief that most of earth's geological record was formed by the great flood described in the story of noah's ark .
fossils and fossil fuels are believed to have formed from animal and plant matter which was buried rapidly during this flood , while submarine canyons are explained as having formed during a rapid runoff from the continents at the end of the flood .
sedimentary strata are also claimed to have been predominantly laid down during or after noah's flood and orogeny .
flood geology is a variant of catastrophism and is contrasted with geological science in that it rejects standard geological principles such as uniformitarianism and radiometric dating .
for example , the creation research society argues that " uniformitarianism is wishful thinking .
" geologists conclude that no evidence for such a flood is observed in the preserved rock layers and moreover that such a flood is physically impossible , given the current layout of land masses .
for instance , since mount everest currently is approximately *num* .
*num* kilometres in elevation and the earth's surface area is *num* , *num* , *num* km , the volume of water required to cover mount everest to a depth of *num* cubits ( *num* .
*num* m ) , as indicated by genesis *num* : *num* , would be *num* .
*num* billion cubic kilometres .
measurements of the amount of precipitable water vapor in the atmosphere have yielded results indicating that condensing all water vapor in a column of atmosphere would produce liquid water with a depth ranging between zero and approximately 70mm , depending on the date and the location of the column .
nevertheless , there continue to be adherents to the belief in flood geology , and in recent years new theories have been introduced such as catastrophic plate tectonics and catastrophic orogeny .
creationists point to experiments they have performed , which they claim demonstrate that *num* .
*num* billion years of nuclear decay took place over a short period of time , from which they infer that " billion-fold speed-ups of nuclear decay " have occurred , a massive violation of the principle that radioisotope decay rates are constant , a core principle underlying nuclear physics generally , and radiometric dating in particular .
the scientific community points to numerous flaws in the creationists ' experiments , to the fact that their results have not been accepted for publication by any peer-reviewed scientific journal , and to the fact that the creationist scientists conducting them were untrained in experimental geochronology .
they have also been criticised for widely publicising the results of their research as successful despite their own admission of insurmountable problems with their hypothesis .
the constancy of the decay rates of isotopes is well supported in science .
evidence for this constancy includes the correspondences of date estimates taken from different radioactive isotopes as well as correspondences with non-radiometric dating techniques such as dendrochronology , ice core dating , and historical records .
although scientists have noted slight increases in the decay rate for isotopes subject to extreme pressures , those differences were too small to significantly impact date estimates .
the constancy of the decay rates is also governed by first principles in quantum mechanics , wherein any deviation in the rate would require a change in the fundamental constants .
according to these principles , a change in the fundamental constants could not influence different elements uniformly , and a comparison between each of the elements ' resulting unique chronological timescales would then give inconsistent time estimates .
in refutation of young earth claims of inconstant decay rates affecting the reliability of radiometric dating , roger c .
wiens , a physicist specializing in isotope dating states : in the 1970s , young earth creationist robert v .
gentry proposed that radiohaloes in certain granites represented evidence for the earth being created instantaneously rather than gradually .
this idea has been criticized by physicists and geologists on many grounds including that the rocks gentry studied were not primordial and that the radionuclides in question need not have been in the rocks initially .
thomas a .
baillieul , a geologist and retired senior environmental scientist with the united states department of energy , disputed gentry's claims in an article entitled , " 'polonium haloes ' refuted : a review of ' radioactive halos in a radio-chronological and cosmological perspective ' by robert v .
gentry .
" baillieul noted that gentry was a physicist with no background in geology and given the absence of this background , gentry had misrepresented the geological context from which the specimens were collected .
additionally , he noted that gentry relied on research from the beginning of the *ord* century , long before radioisotopes were thoroughly understood ; that his assumption that a polonium isotope caused the rings was speculative ; and that gentry falsely argued that the half-life of radioactive elements varies with time .
gentry claimed that baillieul could not publish his criticisms in a reputable scientific journal , although some of baillieul's criticisms rested on work previously published in reputable scientific journals .
several attempts have been made by creationists to construct a cosmology consistent with a young universe rather than the standard cosmological age of the universe , based on the belief that genesis describes the creation of the universe as well as the earth .
the primary challenge for young-universe cosmologies is that the accepted distances in the universe require millions or billions of years for light to travel to earth ( the " starlight problem " ) .
an older creationist idea , proposed by creationist astronomer barry setterfield , is that the speed of light has decayed in the history of the universe .
more recently , creationist physicist russell humphreys has proposed a hypothesis called " white hole cosmology " which suggests that the universe expanded out of a white hole less than *num* , *num* years ago ; the apparent age of the universe results from relativistic effects .
humphreys ' theory is advocated by creationist organisations such as answers in genesis ; however because the predictions of humphreys ' cosmology conflict with current observations , it is not accepted by the scientific community .
various claims are made by creationists concerning alleged evidence that the age of the solar system is of the order of thousands of years , in contrast to the scientifically accepted age of *num* .
*num* billion years .
it is commonly argued that the number of comets in the solar system is much higher than would be expected given its supposed age .
creationist astronomers express scepticism about the existence of the kuiper belt and oort cloud .
creationists also argue that the recession of the moon from the earth is incompatible with either the moon or the earth being billions of years old .
these claims have been refuted by planetologists .
in response to increasing evidence suggesting that mars once possessed a wetter climate , some creationists have proposed that the global flood affected not only the earth but also mars and other planets .
people who support this claim include creationist astronomer wayne spencer and russell humphreys .
an ongoing problem for creationists is the presence of impact craters on nearly all solar system objects , which is consistent with scientific explanations of solar system origins but creates insuperable problems for young earth claims .
creationists harold slusher and richard mandock , along with glenn morton ( who later repudiated this claim ) asserted that impact craters on the moon are subject to rock flow , and so cannot be more than a few thousand years old .
while some creationist astronomers assert that different phases of meteoritic bombardment of the solar system occurred during creation week and during the subsequent great flood , others regard this as unsupported by the evidence and call for further research .
brass brass is an alloy of copper and zinc , in proportions which can be varied to achieve varying mechanical and electrical properties .
it is a substitutional alloy : atoms of the two constituents may replace each other within the same crystal structure .
in contrast , bronze is an alloy of copper and tin .
both bronze and brass may include small proportions of a range of other elements including arsenic , lead , phosphorus , aluminium , manganese , and silicon .
the distinction is largely historical .
modern practice in museums and archaeology increasingly avoids both terms for historical objects in favour of the all-embracing " copper alloy " .
brass is used for decoration for its bright gold-like appearance ; for applications where low friction is required such as locks , gears , bearings , doorknobs , ammunition casings and valves ; for plumbing and electrical applications ; and extensively in brass musical instruments such as horns and bells where a combination of high workability ( historically with hand tools ) and durability is desired .
it is also used in zippers .
brass is often used in situations in which it is important that sparks not be struck , such as in fittings and tools used near flammable or explosive materials .
brass has higher malleability than bronze or zinc .
the relatively low melting point of brass ( , depending on composition ) and its flow characteristics make it a relatively easy material to cast .
by varying the proportions of copper and zinc , the properties of the brass can be changed , allowing hard and soft brasses .
the density of brass is .
today , almost *num* % of all brass alloys are recycled .
because brass is not ferromagnetic , it can be separated from ferrous scrap by passing the scrap near a powerful magnet .
brass scrap is collected and transported to the foundry where it is melted and recast into billets .
billets are heated and extruded into the desired form and size .
the general softness of brass means that it can often be machined without the use of cutting fluid , though there are exceptions to this .
aluminium makes brass stronger and more corrosion-resistant .
aluminium also causes a highly beneficial hard layer of aluminium oxide ( alo ) to be formed on the surface that is thin , transparent and self-healing .
tin has a similar effect and finds its use especially in seawater applications ( naval brasses ) .
combinations of iron , aluminium , silicon and manganese make brass wear and tear resistant .
to enhance the machinability of brass , lead is often added in concentrations of around *num* % .
since lead has a lower melting point than the other constituents of the brass , it tends to migrate towards the grain boundaries in the form of globules as it cools from casting .
the pattern the globules form on the surface of the brass increases the available lead surface area which in turn affects the degree of leaching .
in addition , cutting operations can smear the lead globules over the surface .
these effects can lead to significant lead leaching from brasses of comparatively low lead content .
in october *num* the california state attorney general sued *num* key manufacturers and distributors over lead content .
in laboratory tests , state researchers found the average brass key , new or old , exceeded the california proposition *num* limits by an average factor of *num* , assuming handling twice a day .
in april *num* manufacturers agreed to reduce lead content to *num* .
*num* % , or face a requirement to warn consumers about lead content .
keys plated with other metals are not affected by the settlement , and may continue to use brass alloys with higher percentage of lead content .
also in california , lead-free materials must be used for " each component that comes into contact with the wetted surface of pipes and pipe fittings , plumbing fittings and fixtures .
" on january *num* , *num* , the maximum amount of lead in " lead-free brass " in california was reduced from *num* % to *num* .
*num* % lead .
/ so-called dezincification resistant ( dzr or dr ) brasses , sometimes referred to as cr ( corrosion resistant ) brasses , are used where there is a large corrosion risk and where normal brasses do not meet the standards .
applications with high water temperatures , chlorides present , or deviating water qualities ( soft water ) play a role .
dzr-brass is excellent in water boiler systems .
this brass alloy must be produced with great care , with special attention placed on a balanced composition and proper production temperatures and parameters to avoid long-term failures .
the high malleability and workability , relatively good resistance to corrosion , and traditionally attributed acoustic properties of brass , have made it the usual metal of choice for construction of musical instruments whose acoustic resonators consist of long , relatively narrow tubing , often folded or coiled for compactness ; silver and its alloys , and even gold , have been used for the same reasons , but brass is the most economical choice .
collectively known as brass instruments , these include the trombone , tuba , trumpet , cornet , baritone horn , euphonium , tenor horn , and french horn , and many other " horns " , many in variously-sized families , such as the saxhorns .
other wind instruments may be constructed of brass or other metals , and indeed most modern student-model flutes and piccolos are made of some variety of brass , usually a cupronickel alloy similar to nickel silver / german silver .
clarinets , especially low clarinets such as the contrabass and subcontrabass , are sometimes made of metal because of limited supplies of the dense , fine-grained tropical hardwoods traditionally preferred for smaller woodwinds .
for the same reason , some low clarinets , bassoons and contrabassoons feature a hybrid construction , with long , straight sections of wood , and curved joints , neck , and / or bell of metal .
the use of metal also avoids the risks of exposing wooden instruments to changes in temperature or humidity , which can cause sudden cracking .
even though the saxophones and sarrusaphones are classified as woodwind instruments , they are normally made of brass for similar reasons , and because their wide , conical bores and thin-walled bodies are more easily and efficiently made by forming sheet metal than by machining wood .
the keywork of most modern woodwinds , including wooden-bodied instruments , is also usually made of an alloy such as nickel silver / german silver .
such alloys are stiffer and more durable than the brass used to construct the instrument bodies , but still workable with simple hand tools -- a boon to quick repairs .
the mouthpieces of both brass instruments and , less commonly , woodwind instruments are often made of brass among other metals as well .
next to the brass instruments , the most notable use of brass in music is in various percussion instruments , most notably cymbals , gongs , and orchestral ( tubular ) bells ( large " church " bells are normally made of bronze ) .
small handbells and " jingle bell " are also commonly made of brass .
the harmonica is a free reed aerophone , also often made from brass .
in organ pipes of the reed family , brass strips ( called tongues ) are used as the reeds , which beat against the shallot ( or beat " through " the shallot in the case of a " free " reed ) .
although not part of the brass section , snare drums are also sometimes made of brass .
some parts on electric guitars are also made from brass , especially inertia blocks on tremolo systems for its tonal properties , and for string nuts and saddles for both tonal properties and its low friction .
the bactericidal properties of brass have been observed for centuries , particularly in marine environments where it prevents biofouling .
depending upon the type and concentration of pathogens and the medium they are in , brass kills these microorganisms within a few minutes to hours of contact .
a large number of independent studies confirm this antimicrobial effect , even against antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as mrsa and vrsa .
the mechanisms of antimicrobial action by copper and its alloys , including brass , are a subject of intense and ongoing investigation .
brass is susceptible to stress corrosion cracking , especially from ammonia or substances containing or releasing ammonia .
the problem is sometimes known as season cracking after it was first discovered in brass cartridges used for rifle ammunition during the 1920s in the british indian army .
the problem was caused by high residual stresses from cold forming of the cases during manufacture , together with chemical attack from traces of ammonia in the atmosphere .
the cartridges were stored in stables and the ammonia concentration rose during the hot summer months , thus initiating brittle cracks .
the problem was resolved by annealing the cases , and storing the cartridges elsewhere .
although forms of brass have been in use since prehistory , its true nature as a copper-zinc alloy was not understood until the post medieval period because the zinc vapor which reacted with copper to make brass was not recognised as a metal .
the king james bible makes many references to " brass " .
the shakespearean english form of the word ' brass ' can mean any bronze alloy , or copper , rather than the strict modern definition of brass .
the earliest brasses may have been natural alloys made by smelting zinc-rich copper ores .
by the roman period brass was being deliberately produced from metallic copper and zinc minerals using the cementation process , and variations on this method continued until the *ord* century .
it was eventually replaced by speltering , the direct alloying of copper and zinc metal which was introduced to europe in the *ord* century .
in west asia and the eastern mediterranean early copper-zinc alloys are now known in small numbers from a number of *ord* millennium bc sites in the aegean , iraq , the united arab emirates , kalmykia , turkmenistan and georgia and from *ord* millennium bc sites in west india , uzbekistan , iran , syria , iraq and canaan .
however , isolated examples of copper-zinc alloys are known in china from as early as the *ord* millennium bc .
the compositions of these early " brass " objects are highly variable and most have zinc contents of between *num* % and *num* % wt which is lower than in brass produced by cementation .
these may be " natural alloys " manufactured by smelting zinc rich copper ores in redox conditions .
many have similar tin contents to contemporary bronze artefacts and it is possible that some copper-zinc alloys were accidental and perhaps not even distinguished from copper .
however the large number of copper-zinc alloys now known suggests that at least some were deliberately manufactured and many have zinc contents of more than *num* % wt which would have resulted in a distinctive golden color .
by the *ord* century bc assyrian cuneiform tablets mention the exploitation of the " copper of the mountains " and this may refer to " natural " brass .
" oreikhalkon " ( mountain copper ) , the ancient greek translation of this term , was later adapted to the latin " aurichalcum " meaning " golden copper " which became the standard term for brass .
in the *ord* century bc plato knew " orichalkos " as rare and nearly as valuable as gold and pliny describes how " aurichalcum " had come from cypriot ore deposits which had been exhausted by the *ord* century ad .
x-ray fluorescence analysis of *num* orichalcum ingots recovered from a *num* , 600-year-old shipwreck off sicily found them to be an alloy made with 75–80 percent copper , 15–20 percent zinc and small percentages of nickel , lead and iron .
during the later part of first millennium bc the use of brass spread across a wide geographical area from britain and spain in the west to iran , and india in the east .
this seems to have been encouraged by exports and influence from the middle east and eastern mediterranean where deliberate production of brass from metallic copper and zinc ores had been introduced .
the *ord* century bc writer theopompus , quoted by strabo , describes how heating earth from andeira in turkey produced " droplets of false silver " , probably metallic zinc , which could be used to turn copper into oreichalkos .
in the *ord* century bc the greek dioscorides seems to have recognised a link between zinc minerals and brass describing how cadmia ( zinc oxide ) was found on the walls of furnaces used to heat either zinc ore or copper and explaining that it can then be used to make brass .
by the first century bc brass was available in sufficient supply to use as coinage in phrygia and bithynia , and after the augustan currency reform of *num* bc it was also used to make roman " dupondii " and " sestertii " .
the uniform use of brass for coinage and military equipment across the roman world may indicate a degree of state involvement in the industry , and brass even seems to have been deliberately boycotted by jewish communities in palestine because of its association with roman authority .
brass was produced by the cementation process where copper and zinc ore are heated together until zinc vapor is produced which reacts with the copper .
there is good archaeological evidence for this process and crucibles used to produce brass by cementation have been found on roman period sites including xanten and nidda in germany , lyon in france and at a number of sites in britain .
they vary in size from tiny acorn sized to large amphorae like vessels but all have elevated levels of zinc on the interior and are lidded .
they show no signs of slag or metal prills suggesting that zinc minerals were heated to produce zinc vapor which reacted with metallic copper in a solid state reaction .
the fabric of these crucibles is porous , probably designed to prevent a buildup of pressure , and many have small holes in the lids which may be designed to release pressure or to add additional zinc minerals near the end of the process .
dioscorides mentioned that zinc minerals were used for both the working and finishing of brass , perhaps suggesting secondary additions .
brass made during the early roman period seems to have varied between *num* % to *num* % wt zinc .
the high content of zinc in coinage and brass objects declined after the first century ad and it has been suggested that this reflects zinc loss during recycling and thus an interruption in the production of new brass .
however it is now thought this was probably a deliberate change in composition and overall the use of brass increases over this period making up around *num* % of all copper alloys used in the roman world by the *ord* century ad .
little is known about the production of brass during the centuries immediately after the collapse of the roman empire .
disruption in the trade of tin for bronze from western europe may have contributed to the increasing popularity of brass in the east and by the *ord* centuries ad over *num* % of copper alloy artefacts from egypt were made of brass .
however other alloys such as low tin bronze were also used and they vary depending on local cultural attitudes , the purpose of the metal and access to zinc , especially between the islamic and byzantine world .
conversely the use of true brass seems to have declined in western europe during this period in favour of gunmetals and other mixed alloys but by about *num* brass artefacts are found in scandinavian graves in scotland , brass was being used in the manufacture of coins in northumbria and there is archaeological and historical evidence for the production of calamine brass in germany and the low countries , areas rich in calamine ore .
these places would remain important centres of brass making throughout the medieval period , especially dinant .
brass objects are still collectively known as " dinanterie " in french .
the baptismal font at st bartholomew's church , liège in modern belgium ( before *num* ) is an outstanding masterpiece of romanesque brass casting , though also often described as bronze .
the metal of the early 12th-century gloucester candlestick is unusual even by medieval standards in being a mixture of copper , zinc , tin , lead , nickel , iron , antimony and arsenic with an unusually large amount of silver , ranging from *num* .
*num* % in the base to *num* .
*num* % in the pan below the candle .
the proportions of this mixture may suggest that the candlestick was made from a hoard of old coins , probably late roman .
latten is a term for decorative borders and similar objects cut from sheet metal , whether of brass or bronze .
aquamaniles were typically made in brass in both the european and islamic worlds .
the cementation process continued to be used but literary sources from both europe and the islamic world seem to describe variants of a higher temperature liquid process which took place in open-topped crucibles .
islamic cementation seems to have used zinc oxide known as " tutiya " or tutty rather than zinc ores for brass-making , resulting in a metal with lower iron impurities .
a number of islamic writers and the *ord* century italian marco polo describe how this was obtained by sublimation from zinc ores and condensed onto clay or iron bars , archaeological examples of which have been identified at kush in iran .
it could then be used for brass making or medicinal purposes .
in *ord* century yemen al-hamdani described how spreading al-iglimiya , probably zinc oxide , onto the surface of molten copper produced tutiya vapor which then reacted with the metal .
the *ord* century iranian writer al-kashani describes a more complex process whereby " tutiya " was mixed with raisins and gently roasted before being added to the surface of the molten metal .
a temporary lid was added at this point presumably to minimise the escape of zinc vapor .
in europe a similar liquid process in open-topped crucibles took place which was probably less efficient than the roman process and the use of the term tutty by albertus magnus in the *ord* century suggests influence from islamic technology .
the *ord* century german monk theophilus described how preheated crucibles were one sixth filled with powdered calamine and charcoal then topped up with copper and charcoal before being melted , stirred then filled again .
the final product was cast , then again melted with calamine .
it has been suggested that this second melting may have taken place at a lower temperature to allow more zinc to be absorbed .
albertus magnus noted that the " power " of both calamine and tutty could evaporate and described how the addition of powdered glass could create a film to bind it to the metal .
german brass making crucibles are known from dortmund dating to the *ord* century ad and from soest and schwerte in westphalia dating to around the *ord* century confirm theophilus ' account , as they are open-topped , although ceramic discs from soest may have served as loose lids which may have been used to reduce zinc evaporation , and have slag on the interior resulting from a liquid process .
some of the most famous objects in african art are the lost wax castings of west africa , mostly from what is now nigeria , produced first by the kingdom of ife and then the benin empire .
though normally described as " bronzes " , the benin bronzes , now mostly in the british museum and other western collections , and the large portrait heads such as the bronze head from ife of " heavily leaded zinc-brass " and the bronze head of queen idia , both also british museum , are better described as brass , though of variable compositions .
work in brass or bronze continued to be important in benin art and other west african traditions such as akan goldweights , where the metal was regarded as a more valuable material than in europe .
the renaissance saw important changes to both the theory and practice of brassmaking in europe .
by the *ord* century there is evidence for the renewed use of lidded cementation crucibles at zwickau in germany .
these large crucibles were capable of producing c .
*num* kg of brass .
there are traces of slag and pieces of metal on the interior .
their irregular composition suggests that this was a lower temperature , not entirely liquid , process .
the crucible lids had small holes which were blocked with clay plugs near the end of the process presumably to maximise zinc absorption in the final stages .
triangular crucibles were then used to melt the brass for casting .
16th-century technical writers such as biringuccio , ercker and agricola described a variety of cementation brass making techniques and came closer to understanding the true nature of the process noting that copper became heavier as it changed to brass and that it became more golden as additional calamine was added .
zinc metal was also becoming more commonplace .
by *num* metallic zinc ingots from india and china were arriving in london and pellets of zinc condensed in furnace flues at the rammelsberg in germany were exploited for cementation brass making from around *num* .
eventually it was discovered that metallic zinc could be alloyed with copper to make brass , a process known as speltering , and by *num* the german chemist johann glauber had recognised that calamine was " nothing else but unmeltable zinc " and that zinc was a " half ripe metal .
" however some earlier high zinc , low iron brasses such as the *num* wightman brass memorial plaque from england may have been made by alloying copper with " zinc " and include traces of cadmium similar to those found in some zinc ingots from china .
however , the cementation process was not abandoned , and as late as the early *ord* century there are descriptions of solid-state cementation in a domed furnace at around 900–950 °c and lasting up to *num* hours .
the european brass industry continued to flourish into the post medieval period buoyed by innovations such as the *ord* century introduction of water powered hammers for the production of battery wares .
by *num* the germany city of aachen alone was capable of producing *num* , *num* cwt of brass per year .
after several false starts during the *ord* and *ord* centuries the brass industry was also established in england taking advantage of abundant supplies of cheap copper smelted in the new coal fired reverberatory furnace .
in *num* bristol brass maker nehemiah champion patented the use of granulated copper , produced by pouring molten metal into cold water .
this increased the surface area of the copper helping it react and zinc contents of up to *num* % wt were reported using this new technique .
in *num* nehemiah's son william champion patented a technique for the first industrial scale distillation of metallic zinc known as " distillation per descencum " or " the english process .
" this local zinc was used in speltering and allowed greater control over the zinc content of brass and the production of high-zinc copper alloys which would have been difficult or impossible to produce using cementation , for use in expensive objects such as scientific instruments , clocks , brass buttons and costume jewellery .
however champion continued to use the cheaper calamine cementation method to produce lower-zinc brass and the archaeological remains of bee-hive shaped cementation furnaces have been identified at his works at warmley .
by the mid-to-late *ord* century developments in cheaper zinc distillation such as john-jaques dony's horizontal furnaces in belgium and the reduction of tariffs on zinc as well as demand for corrosion-resistant high zinc alloys increased the popularity of speltering and as a result cementation was largely abandoned by the *ord* century .
definition of music a definition of music endeavors to give an accurate and concise explanation of music's basic attributes or essential nature and it involves a process of defining what is meant by the term " music " .
many authorities have suggested definitions , but defining music turns out to be more difficult than might first be imagined and there is ongoing debate .
a number of explanations start with the notion of music as " organized sound " but they also highlight that this is perhaps too broad a definition and cite examples of organized sound that are not defined as music , such as human speech , and sounds found in both natural and industrial environments .
the problem of defining music is further complicated by the influence of culture in music cognition .
the " concise oxford dictionary " defines music as " the art of combining vocal or instrumental sounds ( or both ) to produce beauty of form , harmony , and expression of emotion " .
however , the music genres known as noise music and musique concrète , for instance , challenge these ideas about what constitutes music's essential attributes by using sounds not widely considered as musical , like randomly produced electronic distortion , feedback , static , cacophony , and compositional processes using indeterminacy ( ; ) .
an oft cited notable example of the dilemma in defining music is a work entitled " 4'33" " ( *num* ) by the american composer john cage ( 1912–1992 ) .
the written score has three movements and directs the performer ( s ) to appear on stage , indicate by gesture or other means when the piece begins , then make no sound and only mark sections and the end by gesture .
what is heard are only whatever ambient sounds may occur in the room .
some argue this is not music because , for example , it contains no sounds that are conventionally considered " musical " and the composer and performer ( s ) exert no control over the organization of the sounds heard .
others argue it is music because the conventional definitions of musical sounds are unnecessarily and arbitrarily limited , and control over the organization of the sounds is achieved by the composer and performer ( s ) through their gestures that divide what is heard into specific sections and a comprehensible form .
because of differing fundamental concepts of music , the languages of many cultures do not contain a word that can be accurately translated as " music , " as that word is generally understood by western cultures .
inuit and most north american indian languages do not have a general term for music .
among the aztecs , the ancient mexican theory of rhetorics , poetry , dance , and instrumental music used the nahuatl term " in xochitl-in kwikatl " to refer to a complex mix of music and other poetic verbal and non-verbal elements , and reserve the word " kwikakayotl " ( or cuicacayotl ) only for the sung expressions .
in africa there is no term for music in tiv , yoruba , igbo , efik , birom , hausa , idoma , eggon or jarawa .
many other languages have terms which only partly cover what western culture typically means by the term " music " ( ) .
the mapuche of argentina do not have a word for " music " , but they do have words for instrumental versus improvised forms ( " kantun " ) , european and non-mapuche music ( " kantun winka " ) , ceremonial songs ( " öl " ) , and " tayil " .
while some languages in west africa have no term for music , some west african languages accept the general concepts of music ( ) .
" musiqi " is the persian word for the science and art of music , " muzik " being the sound and performance of music ( ) , though some things european-influenced listeners would include , such as quran chanting , are excluded .
ben watson points out that ludwig van beethoven's " grosse fuge " ( *num* ) " sounded like noise " to his audience at the time .
indeed , beethoven's publishers persuaded him to remove it from its original setting as the last movement of a string quartet .
he did so , replacing it with a sparkling " allegro " .
they subsequently published it separately .
musicologist jean-jacques nattiez considers the difference between noise and music nebulous , explaining that " the border between music and noise is always culturally defined—which implies that , even within a single society , this border does not always pass through the same place ; in short , there is rarely a consensus .
.
.
by all accounts there is no " single " and " intercultural " universal concept defining what music might be " .
an often-cited definition of music is that it is " organized sound " , a term originally coined by modernist composer edgard varèse in reference to his own musical aesthetic .
varèse's concept of music as " organized sound " fits into his vision of " sound as living matter " and of " musical space as open rather than bounded " .
he conceived the elements of his music in terms of " sound-masses " , likening their organization to the natural phenomenon of crystallization .
varèse thought that " to stubbornly conditioned ears , anything new in music has always been called noise " , and he posed the question , " what is music but organized noises ? " .
the fifteenth edition of the " encyclopædia britannica " states that " while there are no sounds that can be described as inherently unmusical , musicians in each culture have tended to restrict the range of sounds they will admit .
" a human organizing element is often felt to be implicit in music ( sounds produced by non-human agents , such as waterfalls or birds , are often described as " musical " , but perhaps less often as " music " ) .
the composer r .
murray states that the sound of classical music " has decays ; it is granular ; it has attacks ; it fluctuates , swollen with impurities—and all this creates a musicality that comes before any ' cultural ' musicality .
" however , in the view of semiologist jean-jacques nattiez , " just as music is whatever people choose to recognize as such , noise is whatever is recognized as disturbing , unpleasant , or both " .
( see " music as social construct " below .
) " "' levi r .
bryant defines music not as a language , but as a marked-based , problem-solving method such as mathematics .
most definitions of music include a reference to sound and a list of universals of music can be generated by stating the elements ( or aspects ) of sound : pitch , timbre , loudness , duration , spatial location and texture ( ) .
however , in terms more specifically relating to music : following wittgenstein , cognitive psychologist eleanor rosch proposes that categories are not clean cut but that something may be more or less a member of a category .
as such the search for musical universals would fail and would not provide one with a valid definition .
this is primarily because other cultures have different understandings in relation to the sounds that english language writers refer to as music .
many people do , however , share a general idea of music .
the websters definition of music is a typical example : " the science or art of ordering tones or sounds in succession , in combination , and in temporal relationships to produce a composition having unity and continuity " ( " webster's collegiate dictionary " , online edition ) .
this approach to the definition focuses not on the " construction " but on the " experience " of music .
an extreme statement of the position has been articulated by the italian composer luciano berio : “music is everything that one listens to with the intention of listening to music” .
this approach permits the boundary between music and noise to change over time as the conventions of musical interpretation evolve within a culture , to be different in different cultures at any given moment , and to vary from person to person according to their experience and proclivities .
it is further consistent with the subjective reality that even what would commonly be considered music is experienced as nonmusic if the mind is concentrating on other matters and thus not perceiving the sound's " essence " " as music " .
in his *num* book , " music as heard " , which sets out from the phenomenological position of husserl , merleau-ponty , and ricœur , thomas clifton defines music as " an ordered arrangement of sounds and silences whose meaning is presentative rather than denotative .
.
.
.
this definition distinguishes music , as an end in itself , from compositional technique , and from sounds as purely physical objects .
" more precisely , " music is the actualization of the possibility of any sound whatever to present to some human being a meaning which he experiences with his body—that is to say , with his mind , his feelings , his senses , his will , and his metabolism " .
it is therefore " a certain reciprocal relation established between a person , his behavior , and a sounding object " .
clifton accordingly differentiates music from non-music on the basis of the human behavior involved , rather than on either the nature of compositional technique or of sounds as purely physical objects .
consequently , the distinction becomes a question of what is meant by musical behavior : " a musically behaving person is one whose very being is absorbed in the significance of the sounds being experienced .
" however , " it is not altogether accurate to say that this person is listening " to " the sounds .
first , the person is doing more than listening : he is perceiving , interpreting , judging , and feeling .
second , the preposition ' to ' puts too much stress on the sounds as such .
thus , the musically behaving person experiences musical significance by means of , or through , the sounds " .
in this framework , clifton finds that there are two things that separate music from non-music : ( *num* ) musical meaning is presentative , and ( *num* ) music and non-music are distinguished in the idea of personal involvement .
" it is the notion of personal involvement which lends significance to the word " ordered " in this definition of music " .
this is not to be understood , however , as a sanctification of extreme relativism , since " it is precisely the ' subjective ' aspect of experience which lured many writers earlier in this century down the path of sheer opinion-mongering .
later on this trend was reversed by a renewed interest in ' objective , ' scientific , or otherwise non-introspective musical analysis .
but we have good reason to believe that a musical experience is not a purely private thing , like seeing pink elephants , and that reporting about such an experience need not be subjective in the sense of it being a mere matter of opinion " .
clifton's task , then , is to describe musical experience and the objects of this experience which , together , are called " phenomena , " and the activity of describing phenomena is called " phenomenology " .
it is important to stress that this definition of music says nothing about aesthetic standards .
music is not a fact or a thing in the world , but a meaning constituted by human beings .
.
.
.
to talk about such experience in a meaningful way demands several things .
first , we have to be willing to let the composition speak to us , to let it reveal its own order and significance .
.
.
.
second , we have to be willing to question our assumptions about the nature and role of musical materials .
.
.
.
last , and perhaps most important , we have to be ready to admit that describing a meaningful experience is itself meaningful .
"music , often an art / entertainment , is a total social fact whose definitions vary according to era and culture , " according to jean .
it is often contrasted with noise .
according to musicologist jean-jacques nattiez : " the border between music and noise is always culturally defined—which implies that , even within a single society , this border does not always pass through the same place ; in short , there is rarely a consensus .
.
.
by all accounts there is no " single " and " intercultural " universal concept defining what music might be " .
given the above demonstration that " there is no limit to the number or the genre of variables that might intervene in a definition of the musical , " an organization of definitions and elements is necessary .
nattiez ( *num* , *num* ) describes definitions according to a tripartite semiological scheme similar to the following : there are three levels of description , the poietic , the neutral , and the esthesic : table describing types of definitions of music : because of this range of definitions , the study of music comes in a wide variety of forms .
there is the study of sound and vibration or acoustics , the cognitive study of music , the study of music theory and performance practice or music theory and ethnomusicology and the study of the reception and history of music , generally called musicology .
abacus the abacus ( " plural " abaci or abacuses ) , also called a counting frame , is a calculating tool that was in use in europe , china and russia , centuries before the adoption of the written hindu–arabic numeral system .
the exact origin of the abacus is still unknown .
today , abacuses are often constructed as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires , but originally they were beans or stones moved in grooves in sand or on tablets of wood , stone , or metal .
abacuses come in different designs .
some designs , like the bead frame consisting of beads divided into tens , are used mainly to teach arithmetic , although they remain popular in the post-soviet states as a tool .
other designs , such as the japanese soroban , have been used for practical calculations even involving several digits .
for any particular abacus design , there usually are numerous different methods to perform a certain type of calculation , which may include basic operations like addition and multiplication , or even more complex ones , such as calculating square roots .
some of these methods may work with non-natural numbers ( numbers such as and ) .
although today many use calculators and computers instead of abacuses to calculate , abacuses still remain in common use in some countries .
merchants , traders and clerks in some parts of eastern europe , russia , china and africa use abacuses , and they are still used to teach arithmetic to children .
some people who are unable to use a calculator because of visual impairment may use an abacus .
the use of the word " abacus " dates before *num* ad , when a middle english work borrowed the word from latin to describe a sandboard abacus .
the latin word came from greek ἄβαξ " abax " which means something without base , and improperly , any piece of rectangular board or plank .
alternatively , without reference to ancient texts on etymology , it has been suggested that it means " a square tablet strewn with dust " , or " drawing-board covered with dust ( for the use of mathematics ) " ( the exact shape of the latin perhaps reflects the genitive form of the greek word , ἄβακoς " abakos " ) .
whereas the table strewn with dust definition is popular , there are those that do not place credence in this at all and in fact state that it is not proven .
greek ἄβαξ itself is probably a borrowing of a northwest semitic , perhaps phoenician , word akin to hebrew " ʾābāq " ( אבק ) , " dust " ( or in post-biblical sense meaning " sand used as a writing surface " ) .
the preferred plural of " abacus " is a subject of disagreement , with both " abacuses " and " abaci " ( hard " c " ) in use .
the user of an abacus is called an " abacist " .
the period 2700–2300 bc saw the first appearance of the sumerian abacus , a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system .
some scholars point to a character from the babylonian cuneiform which may have been derived from a representation of the abacus .
it is the belief of old babylonian scholars such as carruccio that old babylonians " may have used the abacus for the operations of addition and subtraction ; however , this primitive device proved difficult to use for more complex calculations " .
the use of the abacus in ancient egypt is mentioned by the greek historian herodotus , who writes that the egyptians manipulated the pebbles from right to left , opposite in direction to the greek left-to-right method .
archaeologists have found ancient disks of various sizes that are thought to have been used as counters .
however , wall depictions of this instrument have not been discovered .
during the achaemenid empire , around *num* bc the persians first began to use the abacus .
under the parthian , sassanian and iranian empires , scholars concentrated on exchanging knowledge and inventions with the countries around them – india , china , and the roman empire , when it is thought to have been exported to other countries .
the earliest archaeological evidence for the use of the greek abacus dates to the *ord* century bc .
also demosthenes ( *num* bc–322 bc ) talked of the need to use pebbles for calculations too difficult for your head .
a play by alexis from the *ord* century bc mentions an abacus and pebbles for accounting , and both diogenes and polybius mention men that sometimes stood for more and sometimes for less , like the pebbles on an abacus .
the greek abacus was a table of wood or marble , pre-set with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations .
this greek abacus saw use in achaemenid persia , the etruscan civilization , ancient rome and , until the french revolution , the western christian world .
a tablet found on the greek island salamis in *num* ad ( the salamis tablet ) , dates back to *num* bc , making it the oldest counting board discovered so far .
it is a slab of white marble long , wide , and thick , on which are *num* groups of markings .
in the center of the tablet is a set of *num* parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line , capped with a semicircle at the intersection of the bottom-most horizontal line and the single vertical line .
below these lines is a wide space with a horizontal crack dividing it .
below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines , again divided into two sections by a line perpendicular to them , but with the semicircle at the top of the intersection ; the third , sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line .
also from this time frame the " darius vase " was unearthed in *num* .
it was covered with pictures including a " treasurer " holding a wax tablet in one hand while manipulating counters on a table with the other .
the earliest known written documentation of the chinese abacus dates to the *ord* century bc .
the chinese abacus , known as the " suanpan " ( 算盤 , lit .
" calculating tray " ) , is typically tall and comes in various widths depending on the operator .
it usually has more than seven rods .
there are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom .
the beads are usually rounded and made of a hardwood .
the beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam ; beads moved toward the beam are counted , while those moved away from it are not .
the " suanpan " can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick movement along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center .
the prototype of the chinese abacus is the appeared during the han dynasty , and the beads are oval .
in the song dynasty or before used the *num* : *num* type or four beads abacus similar to the modern abacus or commony known as japanese style abacus , " you can make a number by hand , " and " beads are counted " , which can be expressed as a decimal number .
therefore , the abacus is designed as a four-bead abacus .
in the early ming dynasty , the abacus began to appear in the form of *num* : *num* abacus .
the upper deck had one bead and the bottom had five beads .
" you can make a number by hand , " and " the number of beads will be counted " .
binary or any of the following numbers , so the abacus is designed as a five-bead abacus .
in the late ming dynasty , the abacus styles that appeared in the form of *num* : *num* .
the upper deck had two beads , and the bottom had five beads .
" you can make a number by hand , " and " beads are counted .
" it can be expressed in hexadecimal or any of the following numbers , and because the calculation method at that time is a chinese catty equal to sixteen tael（一斤十六兩）which means hexadecimal , the abacus is designed as a two-five bead .
"suanpan " can be used for functions other than counting .
unlike the simple counting board used in elementary schools , very efficient suanpan techniques have been developed to do multiplication , division , addition , subtraction , square root and cube root operations at high speed .
there are currently schools teaching students how to use it .
in the long scroll " along the river during the qingming festival " painted by zhang zeduan during the song dynasty ( 960–1297 ) , a " suanpan " is clearly visible beside an account book and doctor's prescriptions on the counter of an apothecary's ( feibao ) .
the similarity of the roman abacus to the chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other , as there is some evidence of a trade relationship between the roman empire and china .
however , no direct connection can be demonstrated , and the similarity of the abacuses may be coincidental , both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand .
where the roman model ( like most modern korean and japanese ) has *num* plus *num* bead per decimal place , the standard " suanpan " has *num* plus *num* .
( incidentally , this allows use with a hexadecimal numeral system , which was used for traditional chinese measures of weight .
) instead of running on wires as in the chinese , korean , and japanese models , the beads of roman model run in grooves , presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower .
another possible source of the " suanpan " is chinese counting rods , which operated with a decimal system but lacked the concept of zero as a place holder .
the zero was probably introduced to the chinese in the tang dynasty ( 618–907 ) when travel in the indian ocean and the middle east would have provided direct contact with india , allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the decimal point from indian merchants and mathematicians .
the normal method of calculation in ancient rome , as in greece , was by moving counters on a smooth table .
originally pebbles ( " calculi " ) were used .
later , and in medieval europe , jetons were manufactured .
marked lines indicated units , fives , tens etc .
as in the roman numeral system .
this system of ' counter casting ' continued into the late roman empire and in medieval europe , and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century .
due to pope sylvester ii's reintroduction of the abacus with modifications , it became widely used in europe once again during the *ord* century this abacus used beads on wires , unlike the traditional roman counting boards , which meant the abacus could be used much faster .
writing in the *ord* century bc , horace refers to the wax abacus , a board covered with a thin layer of black wax on which columns and figures were inscribed using a stylus .
one example of archaeological evidence of the roman abacus , shown here in reconstruction , dates to the *ord* century ad .
it has eight long grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each .
the groove marked i indicates units , x tens , and so on up to millions .
the beads in the shorter grooves denote fives –five units , five tens etc .
, essentially in a bi-quinary coded decimal system , related to the roman numerals .
the short grooves on the right may have been used for marking roman " ounces " ( i .
e .
fractions ) .
the decimal number system invented in india replaced the abacus in western europe .
the " abhidharmakośabhāṣya " of vasubandhu ( 316-396 ) , a sanskrit work on buddhist philosophy , says that the second-century ce philosopher vasumitra said that " placing a wick ( sanskrit " vartikā " ) on the number one ( " ekāṅka " ) means it is a one , while placing the wick on the number hundred means it is called a hundred , and on the number one thousand means it is a thousand " .
it is unclear exactly what this arrangement may have been .
around the *ord* century , indian clerks were already finding new ways of recording the contents of the abacus .
hindu texts used the term " śūnya " ( zero ) to indicate the empty column on the abacus .
in japanese , the abacus is called " soroban " ( , lit .
" counting tray " ) , imported from china in the *ord* century .
it was probably in use by the working class a century or more before the ruling class started , as the class structure did not allow for devices used by the lower class to be adopted or used by the ruling class .
the *num* / *num* abacus , which is suited to decimal calculation popular appeared circa *num* , and became widespread as the japanese abandoned hexadecimal weight calculation which was still common in china .
today's japanese abacus is a *num* : *num* type , four-bead abacus was introduced from china in the muromachi era .
it adopts the form of the upper deck one bead and the bottom four beads .
the top bead on the upper deck was equal to five and the bottom one is equal to one like the chinese or korean abacus , and the decimal number can be expressed , so the abacus is designed as one four abacus .
the beads are always in the shape of a diamond .
the quotient division is generally used instead of the division method ; at the same time , in order to make the multiplication and division digits consistently use the division multiplication .
later , japan had a *num* : *num* abacus called天三算盤 , which is now the ize rongji collection of shansi village in yamagata city .
there were also had *num* : *num* beads abacus .
with the four-bead abacus spread , it is also common to use japanese abacus around the world .
there are also improved japanese abacus in various places .
one of the japanese-made abacus made in china is an aluminum frame plastic bead abacus .
the file is next to the four beads , and the " clearing " button , press the clearing button , immediately put the upper bead to the upper position , the lower bead is dialed to the lower position , immediately clearing , easy to use .
the abacus is still manufactured in japan today even with the proliferation , practicality , and affordability of pocket electronic calculators .
the use of the soroban is still taught in japanese primary schools as part of mathematics , primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation .
using visual imagery of a soroban , one can arrive at the answer in the same time as , or even faster than , is possible with a physical instrument .
the chinese abacus migrated from china to korea around *num* ad .
koreans call it " jupan " ( 주판 ) , " supan " ( 수판 ) or " jusan " ( 주산 ) .
the four beads abacus ( *num* : *num* ) was introduced to korea goryeo dynaty from the china during song dynasty , later the five beads abacus ( *num* : *num* ) abacus was introduced to korean from china during the ming dynasty .
some sources mention the use of an abacus called a " nepohualtzintzin " in ancient aztec culture .
this mesoamerican abacus used a 5-digit base-20 system .
the word nepōhualtzintzin comes from nahuatl and it is formed by the roots ; " ne " – personal - ; " pōhual " or " pōhualli " – the account - ; and " tzintzin " – small similar elements .
its complete meaning was taken as : counting with small similar elements by somebody .
its use was taught in the calmecac to the " temalpouhqueh " , who were students dedicated to take the accounts of skies , from childhood .
the nepōhualtzintzin was divided in two main parts separated by a bar or intermediate cord .
in the left part there were four beads , which in the first row have unitary values ( *num* , *num* , *num* , and *num* ) , and in the right side there are three beads with values of *num* , *num* , and *num* respectively .
in order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows , it is enough to multiply by *num* ( by each row ) , the value of the corresponding account in the first row .
altogether , there were *num* rows with *num* beads in each one , which made up *num* beads in each nepōhualtzintzin .
this was a basic number to understand , *num* times *num* , a close relation conceived between natural phenomena , the underworld and the cycles of the heavens .
one nepōhualtzintzin ( *num* ) represented the number of days that a season of the year lasts , two nepōhualtzitzin ( *num* ) is the number of days of the corn's cycle , from its sowing to its harvest , three nepōhualtzintzin ( *num* ) is the number of days of a baby's gestation , and four nepōhualtzintzin ( *num* ) completed a cycle and approximate a year ( *num* days short ) .
when translated into modern computer arithmetic , the nepōhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from *num* to the *num* in floating point , which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision , meant that no round off was allowed .
the rediscovery of the nepōhualtzintzin was due to the mexican engineer david esparza hidalgo , who in his wanderings throughout mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in gold , jade , encrustations of shell , etc .
there have also been found very old nepōhualtzintzin attributed to the olmec culture , and even some bracelets of mayan origin , as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures .
george i .
sanchez , " arithmetic in maya " , austin-texas , *num* found another base *num* , base *num* abacus in the yucatán peninsula that also computed calendar data .
this was a finger abacus , on one hand *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , and *num* were used ; and on the other hand *num* , *num* , *num* and *num* were used .
note the use of zero at the beginning and end of the two cycles .
sanchez worked with sylvanus morley , a noted mayanist .
the quipu of the incas was a system of colored knotted cords used to record numerical data , like advanced tally sticks – but not used to perform calculations .
calculations were carried out using a yupana ( quechua for " counting tool " ; see figure ) which was still in use after the conquest of peru .
the working principle of a yupana is unknown , but in *num* an explanation of the mathematical basis of these instruments was proposed by italian mathematician nicolino de pasquale .
by comparing the form of several yupanas , researchers found that calculations were based using the fibonacci sequence *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* and powers of *num* , *num* and *num* as place values for the different fields in the instrument .
using the fibonacci sequence would keep the number of grains within any one field at a minimum .
the russian abacus , the " schoty " ( счёты ) , usually has a single slanted deck , with ten beads on each wire ( except one wire , usually positioned near the user , with four beads for quarter-ruble fractions ) .
older models have another 4-bead wire for quarter-kopeks , which were minted until *num* .
the russian abacus is often used vertically , with wires from left to right in the manner of a book .
the wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center , to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides .
it is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right .
during manipulation , beads are moved to the left .
for easy viewing , the middle *num* beads on each wire ( the *ord* and *ord* bead ) usually are of a different color from the other eight beads .
likewise , the left bead of the thousands wire ( and the million wire , if present ) may have a different color .
as a simple , cheap and reliable device , the russian abacus was in use in all shops and markets throughout the former soviet union , and the usage of it was taught in most schools until the 1990s .
even the *num* invention of mechanical calculator , odhner arithmometer , had not replaced them in russia and likewise the mass production of felix arithmometers since *num* did not significantly reduce their use in the soviet union .
the russian abacus began to lose popularity only after the mass production of microcalculators had started in the soviet union in *num* .
today it is regarded as an archaism and replaced by the handheld calculator .
the russian abacus was brought to france around *num* by the mathematician jean-victor poncelet , who served in napoleon's army and had been a prisoner of war in russia .
the abacus had fallen out of use in western europe in the *ord* century with the rise of decimal notation and algorismic methods .
to poncelet's french contemporaries , it was something new .
poncelet used it , not for any applied purpose , but as a teaching and demonstration aid .
the turks and the armenian people also used abacuses similar to the russian schoty .
it was named a " coulba " by the turks and a " choreb " by the armenians .
around the world , abacuses have been used in pre-schools and elementary schools as an aid in teaching the numeral system and arithmetic .
in western countries , a bead frame similar to the russian abacus but with straight wires and a vertical frame has been common ( see image ) .
it is still often seen as a plastic or wooden toy .
the wire frame may be used either with positional notation like other abacuses ( thus the 10-wire version may represent numbers up to *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* ) , or each bead may represent one unit ( so that e .
g .
*num* can be represented by shifting all beads on *num* wires and *num* beads on the *ord* wire , so numbers up to *num* may be represented ) .
in the bead frame shown , the gap between the *ord* and *ord* wire , corresponding to the color change between the *ord* and the *ord* bead on each wire , suggests the latter use .
the red-and-white abacus is used in contemporary primary schools for a wide range of number-related lessons .
the twenty bead version , referred to by its dutch name " rekenrek " ( " calculating frame " ) , is often used , sometimes on a string of beads , sometimes on a rigid framework .
by learning how to calculate with abacus , one can improve one's mental calculation which becomes faster and more accurate in doing large number calculations .
abacus‐based mental calculation ( amc ) was derived from the abacus which means doing calculation , including addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division , in mind with an imagined abacus .
it is a high-level cognitive skill that run through calculations with an effective algorithm .
people doing long-term amc training show higher numerical memory capacity and have more effectively connected neural pathways .
they are able to retrieve memory to deal with complex processes to calculate .
the processing of amc involves both the visuospatial and visuomotor processing which generate the visual abacus and perform the movement of the imaginary bead .
since the only thing needed to be remembered is the finial position of beads , it takes less memory and less computation time .
an adapted abacus , invented by tim cranmer , called a cranmer abacus is still commonly used by individuals who are blind .
a piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads so that they do not move inadvertently .
this keeps the beads in place while the users feel or manipulate them .
they use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions multiplication , division , addition , subtraction , square root and cube root .
although blind students have benefited from talking calculators , the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early grades , both in public schools and state schools for the blind .
blind students also complete mathematical assignments using a braille-writer and nemeth code ( a type of braille code for mathematics ) but large multiplication and long division problems can be long and difficult .
the abacus gives blind and visually impaired students a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using pencil and paper .
many blind people find this number machine a very useful tool throughout life .
the binary abacus is used to explain how computers manipulate numbers .
the abacus shows how numbers , letters , and signs can be stored in a binary system on a computer , or via ascii .
the device consists of a series of beads on parallel wires arranged in three separate rows .
the beads represent a switch on the computer in either an " on " or " off " position .
carotene the term carotene ( also carotin , from the latin " carota " , " carrot " ) is used for many related unsaturated hydrocarbon substances having the formula ch , which are synthesized by plants but in general cannot be made by animals ( with the exception of some aphids and spider mites which acquired the synthesizing genes from fungi ) .
carotenes are photosynthetic pigments important for photosynthesis .
carotenes contain no oxygen atoms .
they absorb ultraviolet , violet , and blue light and scatter orange or red light , and ( in low concentrations ) yellow light .
carotenes are responsible for the orange colour of the carrot , for which this class of chemicals is named , and for the colours of many other fruits , vegetables and fungi ( for example , sweet potatoes , chanterelle and orange cantaloupe melon ) .
carotenes are also responsible for the orange ( but not all of the yellow ) colours in dry foliage .
they also ( in lower concentrations ) impart the yellow coloration to milk-fat and butter .
omnivorous animal species which are relatively poor converters of coloured dietary carotenoids to colourless retinoids have yellowed-coloured body fat , as a result of the carotenoid retention from the vegetable portion of their diet .
the typical yellow-coloured fat of humans and chickens is a result of fat storage of carotenes from their diets .
carotenes contribute to photosynthesis by transmitting the light energy they absorb to chlorophyll .
they also protect plant tissues by helping to absorb the energy from singlet oxygen , an excited form of the oxygen molecule o which is formed during photosynthesis .
β-carotene is composed of two retinyl groups , and is broken down in the mucosa of the human small intestine by β-carotene *num* , 15'-monooxygenase to retinal , a form of vitamin a .
β-carotene can be stored in the liver and body fat and converted to retinal as needed , thus making it a form of vitamin a for humans and some other mammals .
the carotenes α-carotene and γ-carotene , due to their single retinyl group ( β-ionone ring ) , also have some vitamin a activity ( though less than β-carotene ) , as does the xanthophyll carotenoid β-cryptoxanthin .
all other carotenoids , including lycopene , have no beta-ring and thus no vitamin a activity ( although they may have antioxidant activity and thus biological activity in other ways ) .
animal species differ greatly in their ability to convert retinyl ( beta-ionone ) containing carotenoids to retinals .
carnivores in general are poor converters of dietary ionone-containing carotenoids .
pure carnivores such as ferrets lack β-carotene *num* , 15'-monooxygenase and cannot convert any carotenoids to retinals at all ( resulting in carotenes not being a form of vitamin a for this species ) ; while cats can convert a trace of β-carotene to retinol , although the amount is totally insufficient for meeting their daily retinol needs .
chemically , carotenes are polyunsaturated hydrocarbons containing *num* carbon atoms per molecule , variable numbers of hydrogen atoms , and no other elements .
some carotenes are terminated by hydrocarbon rings , on one or both ends of the molecule .
all are coloured to the human eye , due to extensive systems of conjugated double bonds .
structurally carotenes are tetraterpenes , meaning that they are synthesized biochemically from four 10-carbon terpene units , which in turn are formed from eight 5-carbon isoprene units .
carotenes are found in plants in two primary forms designated by characters from the greek alphabet : alpha-carotene ( α-carotene ) and beta-carotene ( β-carotene ) .
gamma- , delta- , epsilon- , and zeta-carotene ( γ , δ , ε , and ζ-carotene ) also exist .
since they are hydrocarbons , and therefore contain no oxygen , carotenes are fat-soluble and insoluble in water ( in contrast with other carotenoids , the xanthophylls , which contain oxygen and thus are less chemically hydrophobic ) .
the following foods are particularly rich in carotenes ( also see vitamin a article for amounts ) : absorption from these foods is enhanced if eaten with fats , as carotenes are fat soluble , and if the food is cooked for a few minutes until the plant cell wall splits and the colour is released into any liquid .
*num* μg of dietary β-carotene supplies the equivalent of *num* μg of retinol , or *num* re ( retinol equivalent ) .
this is equivalent to *num* iu of vitamin a .
the two primary isomers of carotene , α-carotene and β-carotene , differ in the position of a double bond ( and thus a hydrogen ) in the cyclic group at one end ( the right end in the diagram at right ) .
β-carotene is the more common form and can be found in yellow , orange , and green leafy fruits and vegetables .
as a rule of thumb , the greater the intensity of the orange colour of the fruit or vegetable , the more β-carotene it contains .
carotene protects plant cells against the destructive effects of ultraviolet light .
β-carotene is an antioxidant .
an article on the american cancer society says that the cancer research campaign has called for warning labels on β-carotene supplements to caution smokers that such supplements may increase the risk of lung cancer .
the new england journal of medicine published an article in *num* about a trial which examined the relationship between daily supplementation of β-carotene and vitamin e ( α-tocopherol ) and the incidence of lung cancer .
the study was done using supplements and researchers were aware of the epidemiological correlation between carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables and lower lung cancer rates .
the research concluded that no reduction in lung cancer was found in the participants using these supplements , and furthermore , these supplements may , in fact , have harmful effects .
the journal of the national cancer institute and the new england journal of medicine published articles in *num* about a trial with a goal to determine if vitamin a ( in the form of retinyl palmitate ) and β-carotene ( at about *num* mg / day , which is *num* times the reference daily intake ) supplements had any beneficial effects to prevent cancer .
the results indicated an " increased " risk of lung and prostate cancers for the participants who consumed the β-carotene supplement and who had lung irritation from smoking or asbestos exposure , causing the trial to be stopped early .
a review of all randomized controlled trials in the scientific literature by the cochrane collaboration published in " jama " in *num* found that synthetic β-carotene " increased " mortality by 1-8 % ( relative risk *num* .
*num* , *num* % confidence interval *num* .
01–1 .
*num* ) .
however , this meta-analysis included two large studies of smokers , so it is not clear that the results apply to the general population .
the review only studied the influence of synthetic antioxidants and the results should not be translated to potential effects of fruits and vegetables .
a recent report demonstrated that *num* mg of β-carotene every other day prevented cognitive decline in a study of over *num* physicians at a mean treatment duration of *num* years .
oral β-carotene is prescribed to people suffering from erythropoietic protoporphyria .
it provides them some relief from photosensitivity .
carotenemia or hypercarotenemia is excess carotene , but unlike excess vitamin a , carotene is non-toxic .
although hypercarotenemia is not particularly dangerous , it can lead to an oranging of the skin ( carotenodermia ) , but not the conjunctiva of eyes ( thus easily distinguishing it visually from jaundice ) .
it is most commonly associated with consumption of an abundance of carrots , but it also can be a medical sign of more dangerous conditions .
β-carotene and lycopene molecules can be encapsulated into carbon nanotubes enhancing the optical properties of carbon nanotubes .
efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the single wall carbon nanotube ( swcnt ) .
encapsulation increases chemical and thermal stability of carotene molecules ; it also allows their isolation and individual characterization .
most of the world's synthetic supply of carotene comes from a manufacturing complex located in freeport , texas and owned by dsm .
the other major supplier basf also uses a chemical process to produce β-carotene .
together these suppliers account for about *num* % of the β-carotene on the market .
in spain vitatene produces natural β-carotene from fungus blakeslea trispora , as does dsm but at much lower amount when compared to its synthetic β-carotene operation .
in australia , organic β-carotene is produced by aquacarotene limited from dried marine algae " dunaliella salina " grown in harvesting ponds situated in karratha , western australia .
basf australia is also producing β-carotene from microalgae grown in two sites in australia that are the world's largest algae farms .
in portugal , the industrial biotechnology company biotrend is producing natural all-"trans"-β-carotene from a non-genetically-modified bacteria of the genus " sphingomonas " isolated from soil .
carotenes are also found in palm oil , corn , and in the milk of dairy cows , causing cow's milk to be light yellow , depending on the feed of the cattle , and the amount of fat in the milk ( high-fat milks , such as those produced by guernsey cows , tend to be yellower because their fat content causes them to contain more carotene ) .
carotenes are also found in some species of termites , where they apparently have been picked up from the diet of the insects .
there are currently two commonly used methods of total synthesis of β-carotene .
the first was developed by the badische anilin- & soda-fabrik ( basf ) and is based on the wittig reaction with wittig himself as patent holder : the second is a grignard reaction , elaborated by hoffman-la roche from the original synthesis of inhoffen et al .
they are both symmetrical ; the basf synthesis is c20 + c20 , and the hoffman-la roche synthesis is c19 + c2 + c19 .
carotenes are carotenoids containing no oxygen .
carotenoids containing some oxygen are known as xanthophylls .
the two ends of the β-carotene molecule are structurally identical , and are called β-rings .
specifically , the group of nine carbon atoms at each end form a β-ring .
the α-carotene molecule has a β-ring at one end ; the other end is called an ε-ring .
there is no such thing as an " α-ring " .
these and similar names for the ends of the carotenoid molecules form the basis of a systematic naming scheme , according to which : ζ-carotene is the biosynthetic precursor of neurosporene , which is the precursor of lycopene , which , in turn , is the precursor of the carotenes α through ε .
carotene is also used as a substance to colour products such as juice , cakes , desserts , butter and margarine .
it is approved for use as a food additive in the eu ( listed as additive e160a ) australia and new zealand ( listed as 160a ) and the us .
casey at the bat "casey at the bat : a ballad of the republic sung in the year *num* " is a baseball poem written in *num* by ernest thayer .
first published in " the san francisco examiner " ( then called " the daily examiner " ) on june *num* , *num* , it was later popularized by dewolf hopper in many vaudeville performances .
it has become one of the best-known poems in american literature .
the poem was originally published anonymously ( under the pen name " phin " , based on thayer's college nickname , " phinney " ) .
a baseball team from the fictional town of " mudville " ( implied to be the home team ) is losing by two runs in its last inning .
both the team and its fans , a crowd of *num* , *num* , believe they can win if casey , mudville's star player , gets to bat .
however , casey is scheduled to be the fifth batter of the inning , and the first two batters ( cooney and barrows ) fail to get on base .
the next two batters ( flynn and jimmy blake ) are perceived to be weak hitters with little chance of reaching base to allow casey a chance to bat .
surprisingly , flynn hits a single , and blake follows with a double that allows flynn to reach third base .
both runners are now in scoring position and casey represents the potential winning run .
casey is so sure of his abilities that he does not swing at the first two pitches , both called strikes .
on the last pitch , the overconfident casey strikes out swinging , ending the game and sending the crowd home unhappy .
the text is filled with references to baseball as it was in *num* , which in many ways is not far removed from today's version .
as a work , the poem encapsulates much of the appeal of baseball , including the involvement of the crowd .
it also has a fair amount of baseball jargon that can pose challenges for the uninitiated .
this is the complete poem as it originally appeared in " the daily examiner " .
after publication , various versions with minor changes were produced .
thayer said he chose the name " casey " after a non-player of irish ancestry he once knew , and it is open to debate who , if anyone , he modeled the character after .
it has been reported that thayer's best friend samuel winslow , who played baseball at harvard , was the inspiration for casey .
another candidate is national league player mike " king " kelly , who became famous when boston paid chicago a record $10 , *num* for him .
he had a personality that fans liked to cheer or jeer .
after the *num* season , kelly went on a playing tour to san francisco .
thayer , who wrote " casey " in *num* , covered the san francisco leg for the " san francisco examiner " .
thayer , in a letter he wrote in *num* , mentions kelly as showing " impudence " in claiming to have written the poem .
the author of the *num* definitive bio of kelly—which included a close tracking of his vaudeville career—did not find kelly claiming to have been the author .
a month after the poem was published , it was reprinted as " kelly at the bat " in the " new york sporting times " .
aside from omitting the first five verses , the only changes from the original are substitutions of kelly for casey , and boston for mudville .
king kelly , then of the boston beaneaters , was one of baseball's two biggest stars at the time ( along with cap anson ) .
in *num* , the magazine " current literature " noted the two versions and said , " the locality , as originally given , is mudville , not boston ; the latter was substituted to give the poem local color .
" sportswriter leonard koppett claimed in a *num* article that the published poem omits *num* lines penned by thayer which change the entire theme of the poem .
koppett said the full version of the poem takes the pitch count on casey to full as his uncle arnold stirs up wagering action in the stands before a wink passes between them and casey throws the game .
dewolf hopper gave the poem's first stage recitation on august *num* , *num* , at new york's wallack theatre as part of the comic opera " prinz methusalem " in the presence of the chicago and new york baseball teams , the white stockings and the giants , respectively ; august *num* , *num* was also thayer's *ord* birthday .
hopper became known as an orator of the poem , and recited it more than *num* , *num* times ( by his count—some tabulations are as much as four times higher ) before his death .
on stage in the early 1890s , baseball star kelly recited the original " casey " a few dozen times and not the parody .
for example , in a review in *num* of a variety show he was in , the " indianapolis news " said , " many who attended the performance had heard of kelly's singing and his reciting , and many had heard de wolf hopper recite ' casey at the bat ' in his inimitable way .
kelly recited this in a sing-song , school-boy fashion .
" upon kelly's death , a writer would say he gained " considerable notoriety by his ludicrous rendition of ' casey at the bat , ' with which he concluded his `turn’ [ act ] at each performance .
" during the 1980s , the magic / comedy team penn & teller performed a version of " casey at the bat " with teller ( the " silent " partner ) struggling to escape a straitjacket while suspended upside-down over a platform of sharp steel spikes .
the set-up was that penn jillette would leap off his chair upon finishing the poem , releasing the rope which supported teller , and send his partner to a gruesome death if he wasn't free by that time .
the drama of the performance was taken up a notch after the third or fourth stanza , when penn jillette began to read out the rest of the poem much faster than the opening stanzas , greatly reducing the time that teller had left to work free from his bonds .
on july *num* , *num* , jack williams recited the poem accompanied by the boston pops during the annual boston pops fireworks spectacular at boston's *num* july celebration .
on july *num* , *num* , the jam rock band furthur performed the poem as part of a second-set medley in center field of doubleday field in cooperstown , new york .
the first recorded version of " casey at the bat " was made by russell hunting , speaking in a broad irish accent , in *num* ; an *num* cylinder recording of the text made for the columbia graphophone label by hunting can be accessed from the cylinder preservation and digitization project at the university of california , santa barbara library .
dewolf hopper's more famous recorded recitation was released in october *num* .
in *num* , walt disney released a recording of the narration of the poem by jerry colonna , which accompanied the studio's animated cartoon adaptation of the poem ( see below ) .
in *num* , the cincinnati symphony orchestra commissioned its former composer-in-residence , frank proto , to create a work to feature baseball hall-of-famer johnny bench with the orchestra .
the result " casey at the bat – an american folk tale for narrator and orchestra " was an immediate hit and recorded by bench and the orchestra .
it has since been performed more than *num* times by nearly every major and metropolitan orchestra in the u .
s .
and canada .
in *num* , baseball pitcher tug mcgraw recorded " casey at the bat—an american folk tale for narrator and orchestra " by frank proto with peter nero and the philly pops .
in *num* , actor james earl jones recorded the poem with arranger / composer steven reineke and the cincinnati pops orchestra .
in *num* , dave jageler and charlie slowes , both radio announcers for the washington nationals , each made recordings of the poem for the library of congress to mark the *ord* anniversary of its first publication .
a rivalry of sorts has developed between two cities claiming to be the mudville described in the poem .
residents of holliston , massachusetts , where there is a neighborhood called mudville , claim it as the mudville described in the poem .
thayer grew up in nearby worcester , massachusetts , where he wrote the poem in *num* ; his family owned a wool mill less than a mile from mudville's baseball field .
however , residents of stockton , california—which was known for a time as mudville prior to incorporation in 1850—also lay claim to being the inspiration for the poem .
in *num* , thayer covered baseball for " the daily examiner"—owned by his harvard classmate william randolph hearst—and is said to have covered the local california league team , the stockton ports .
for the *num* season , after the poem became popular , stockton's team was renamed the mudville nine .
the team reverted to the mudville nine moniker for the *num* and *num* seasons .
the visalia rawhide , another california league team , currently keep mudville alive by playing in mudville jerseys on june *num* each year .
despite the towns ' rival claims , thayer himself told the " syracuse post-standard " that " the poem has no basis in fact .
" the poem has been adapted to diverse types of media : for a relatively short poem apparently dashed off quickly ( and denied by its author for years ) , " casey at the bat " had a profound effect on american popular culture .
it has been recited , re-enacted , adapted , dissected , parodied and subjected to just about every other treatment one could imagine .
"casey's revenge " , by grantland rice ( *num* ) , gives casey another chance against the pitcher who had struck him out in the original story .
it was written in *num* , and its first known publication was in the quarterly magazine " the speaker " in june *num* , under the pseudonym of james wilson .
in this version , rice cites the nickname " strike-out casey " , hence the influence on casey stengel's name .
casey's team is down " three " runs by the last of the ninth , and once again casey is down to two strikes—with the bases full this time .
however , he connects , hits the ball so far that it is never found .
of the many parodies made of the poem , some of the notable ones include : there are three known translations of the poem into a foreign language , one in french , written in *num* by french canadian linguist paul laurendeau , with the title " casey au bâton " , and two in hebrew .
one by the sports journalist menachem less titled " התור של קייסי לחבוט " [ hator shel casey lachbot ] , and the other more recent and more true to the original cadence and style by jason h .
elbaum called קֵיסִי בַּמַּחְבֵּט [ casey bamachbayt ] .
casey stengel describes in his autobiography how his original nickname " k .
c .
" ( for his hometown , kansas city , missouri ) evolved into " casey " .
it was influenced not just by the name of the poem , which was widely popular in the 1910s , but also because he tended to strike out frequently in his early career so fans and writers started calling him " strikeout casey " .
the poem is referenced in the super nintendo entertainment system game " earthbound " , where a weapon is named the casey bat , which is the strongest weapon in the game , but will only hit *num* % of the time .
a one-time character in the " pokémon " anime , a girl who is a very enthusiastic fan of baseball , is named " casey " in the english version in reference to the poem .
a baseball-themed episode of the twilight zone was named the mighty casey in reference to the poem's lead character , though the plot is unrelated .
in the show friends , ross clarifies how to spell " casey " as in " at the bat " in the season *num* , episode *num* entitled " the one with the prom video .
" in the show containment , season *num* , episode *num* takes its name , “he stilled the rising tumult” , from the poem .
on july *num* , *num* , the united states postal service issued a commemorative stamp depicting " mighty casey .
" the stamp was part of a set commemorating american folk heroes .
other stamps in the set depicted paul bunyan , john henry , and pecos bill .
ethanol ethanol ( also called ethyl alcohol , grain alcohol , drinking alcohol , or simply alcohol ) is a chemical compound , a simple alcohol with the chemical formula .
its formula can be also written as −− or − ( an ethyl group linked to a hydroxyl group ) , and is often abbreviated as etoh .
ethanol is a volatile , flammable , colorless liquid with a slight characteristic odor .
it is a psychoactive substance and is the principal type of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks .
ethanol is naturally produced by the fermentation of sugars by yeasts or via petrochemical processes , and is most commonly consumed as a popular recreational drug .
it also has medical applications as an antiseptic and disinfectant .
the compound is widely used as a chemical solvent , either for scientific chemical testing or in synthesis of other organic compounds , and is a vital substance used across many different kinds of manufacturing industries .
ethanol is also used as a clean-burning fuel source .
"ethanol " is the systematic name defined by the international union of pure and applied chemistry ( iupac ) for a compound consisting of alkyl group with two carbon atoms ( prefix “eth-” ) , having a single bond between them ( infix “-an-” ) , attached functional group −oh group ( suffix “-ol” ) .
the “eth-” prefix and the qualifier “ethyl” in “ethyl alcohol” originally come from the name “ethyl” assigned in *num* to the group − by justus liebig .
he coined the word from the german name " aether " of the compound −o− ( commonly called “ether” in english , more specifically called “diethyl ether” ) .
according to the oxford english dictionary , " ethyl " is a contraction of the ancient greek αἰθήρ ( ' , “upper air” ) and the greek word ὕλη ( ' , “substance” ) .
the name " ethanol " was coined as a result of a resolution that was adopted at the international conference on chemical nomenclature that was held in april *num* in geneva , switzerland .
the term “alcohol” now refers to a wider class of substances in chemistry nomenclature , but in common parlance it remains the name of ethanol .
the oxford english dictionary claims that it is a medieval loan from arabic " al-kuḥl " , a powdered ore of antimony used since antiquity as a cosmetic , and retained that meaning in middle latin .
the use of “alcohol” for ethanol ( in full , “alcohol of wine” ) is modern , first recorded *num* , and by the later *ord* century referred to “any sublimated substance ; distilled spirit” use for “the spirit of wine” ( shortened from a full expression " alcohol of wine " ) .
the systematic use in chemistry dates to *num* .
ethanol is used in medical wipes and most commonly in antibacterial hand sanitizer gels as an antiseptic for its bactericidal and anti-fungal effects .
ethanol kills organisms by denaturing their proteins and dissolving their lipids and is effective against most bacteria and fungi , and many viruses .
however , ethanol is ineffective against bacterial spores .
*num* % ethanol is the most effective concentration , particularly because of osmotic pressure .
absolute ethanol may inactivate microbes without destroying them because the alcohol is unable to fully permeate the microbe's membrane .
ethanol can also be used as a disinfect and antiseptic because it causes cell dehydration by disrupting the osmotic balance across cell membrane , so water leaves the cell leading to cell death .
ethanol may be administered as an antidote to methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning .
ethanol , often in high concentrations , is used to dissolve many water-insoluble medications and related compounds .
liquid preparations of crack cocaine , pain medication , and mouth washes may be dissolved in *num* to *num* % concentrations of ethanol and may need to be avoided in individuals with adverse reactions to ethanol such as alcohol-induced respiratory reactions .
ethanol is present mainly as an antimicrobial preservative in over *num* liquid preparations of medicine including acetaminophen , iron supplements , ranitidine , furosemide , mannitol , phenobarbital , trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole and over-the-counter cough medicine .
if ingested orally , ethanol is extensively metabolized by the liver , particularly via the enzyme cyp450 .
ethyl alcohol increases the secretion of acids in the stomach .
the metabolite acetaldehyde is responsible for much of the short term , and long term effects of ethyl alcohol toxicity .
as a central nervous system depressant , ethanol is one of the most commonly consumed psychoactive drugs .
the largest single use of ethanol is as an engine fuel and fuel additive .
brazil in particular relies heavily upon the use of ethanol as an engine fuel , due in part to its role as the globe's leading producer of ethanol .
gasoline sold in brazil contains at least *num* % anhydrous ethanol .
hydrous ethanol ( about *num* % ethanol and *num* % water ) can be used as fuel in more than *num* % of new gasoline fueled cars sold in the country .
brazilian ethanol is produced from sugar cane and noted for high carbon sequestration .
the us and many other countries primarily use e10 ( *num* % ethanol , sometimes known as gasohol ) and e85 ( *num* % ethanol ) ethanol / gasoline mixtures .
ethanol has been used as rocket fuel and is currently in lightweight rocket-powered racing aircraft .
australian law limits the use of pure ethanol from sugarcane waste to *num* % in automobiles .
older cars ( and vintage cars designed to use a slower burning fuel ) should have the engine valves upgraded or replaced .
according to an industry advocacy group , ethanol as a fuel reduces harmful tailpipe emissions of carbon monoxide , particulate matter , oxides of nitrogen , and other ozone-forming pollutants .
argonne national laboratory analyzed greenhouse gas emissions of many different engine and fuel combinations , and found that biodiesel / petrodiesel blend ( b20 ) showed a reduction of *num* % , conventional e85 ethanol blend a reduction of *num* % and cellulosic ethanol *num* % , compared with pure gasoline .
ethanol combustion in an internal combustion engine yields many of the products of incomplete combustion produced by gasoline and significantly larger amounts of formaldehyde and related species such as acetaldehyde .
this leads to a significantly larger photochemical reactivity and more ground level ozone .
these data have been assembled into the clean fuels report comparison of fuel emissions and show that ethanol exhaust generates *num* .
*num* times as much ozone as gasoline exhaust .
when this is added into the custom " localised pollution index ( lpi ) " of the clean fuels report , the local pollution of ethanol ( pollution that contributes to smog ) is rated *num* .
*num* , where gasoline is *num* .
*num* and higher numbers signify greater pollution .
the california air resources board formalized this issue in *num* by recognizing control standards for formaldehydes as an emissions control group , much like the conventional nox and reactive organic gases ( rogs ) .
world production of ethanol in *num* was , with *num* % of the world supply coming from brazil and the united states .
more than *num* % of brazilian cars are able to use *num* % ethanol as fuel , which includes ethanol-only engines and flex-fuel engines .
flex-fuel engines in brazil are able to work with all ethanol , all gasoline or any mixture of both .
in the us flex-fuel vehicles can run on *num* % to *num* % ethanol ( *num* % gasoline ) since higher ethanol blends are not yet allowed or efficient .
brazil supports this population of ethanol-burning automobiles with large national infrastructure that produces ethanol from domestically grown sugar cane .
sugar cane not only has a greater concentration of sucrose than corn ( by about *num* % ) , but is also much easier to extract .
the bagasse generated by the process is not wasted , but is used in power plants to produce electricity .
in the united states , the ethanol fuel industry is based largely on corn .
according to the renewable fuels association , as of *num* october *num* , *num* grain ethanol bio-refineries in the united states have the capacity to produce of ethanol per year .
an additional *num* construction projects underway ( in the u .
s .
) can add of new capacity in the next *num* months .
over time , it is believed that a material portion of the ≈ per year market for gasoline will begin to be replaced with fuel ethanol .
sweet sorghum is another potential source of ethanol , and is suitable for growing in dryland conditions .
the international crops research institute for the semi-arid tropics ( icrisat ) is investigating the possibility of growing sorghum as a source of fuel , food , and animal feed in arid parts of asia and africa .
sweet sorghum has one-third the water requirement of sugarcane over the same time period .
it also requires about *num* % less water than corn ( also known as maize ) .
the world’s first sweet sorghum ethanol distillery began commercial production in *num* in andhra pradesh , india .
ethanol's high miscibility with water makes it unsuitable for shipping through modern pipelines like liquid hydrocarbons .
mechanics have seen increased cases of damage to small engines ( in particular , the carburetor ) and attribute the damage to the increased water retention by ethanol in fuel .
ethanol was commonly used as fuel in early bipropellant rocket ( liquid propelled ) vehicles , in conjunction with an oxidizer such as liquid oxygen .
the german v-2 rocket of world war ii , credited with beginning the space age , used ethanol as the main constituent of " b-stoff " , under such nomenclature the ethanol was mixed with *num* % of water to reduce the combustion chamber temperature .
the v-2's design team helped develop u .
s .
rockets following world war ii , including the ethanol-fueled redstone rocket which launched the first u .
s .
satellite .
alcohols fell into general disuse as more efficient rocket fuels were developed .
commercial fuel cells operate on reformed natural gas , hydrogen or methanol .
ethanol is an attractive alternative due to its wide availability , low cost , high purity and low toxicity .
there are a wide range of fuel cell concepts that have been trialled including direct-ethanol fuel cells , auto-thermal reforming systems and thermally integrated systems .
the majority of work is being conducted at a research level although there are a number of organizations at the beginning of commercialization of ethanol fuel cells .
ethanol fireplaces can be used for home heating or for decoration .
ethanol is an important industrial ingredient .
it has widespread use as a precursor for other organic compounds such as ethyl halides , ethyl esters , diethyl ether , acetic acid , and ethyl amines .
ethanol is miscible with water and is a good general purpose solvent .
it is found in paints , tinctures , markers , and personal care products such as mouthwashes , perfumes and deodorants .
however , polysaccharides precipitate from aqueous solution in the presence of alcohol , and ethanol precipitation is used for this reason in the purification of dna and rna .
because of its low melting point ( −114 .
*num* °c ) and low toxicity , ethanol is sometimes used in laboratories ( with dry ice or other coolants ) as a cooling bath to keep vessels at temperatures below the freezing point of water .
for the same reason , it is also used as the active fluid in alcohol thermometers .
ethanol is a 2-carbon alcohol .
its molecular formula is chchoh .
an alternative notation is ch−ch−oh , which indicates that the carbon of a methyl group ( ch− ) is attached to the carbon of a methylene group ( −ch– ) , which is attached to the oxygen of a hydroxyl group ( −oh ) .
it is a constitutional isomer of dimethyl ether .
ethanol is sometimes abbreviated as etoh , using the common organic chemistry notation of representing the ethyl group ( ch− ) with et .
ethanol is a volatile , colorless liquid that has a slight odor .
it burns with a smokeless blue flame that is not always visible in normal light .
the physical properties of ethanol stem primarily from the presence of its hydroxyl group and the shortness of its carbon chain .
ethanol's hydroxyl group is able to participate in hydrogen bonding , rendering it more viscous and less volatile than less polar organic compounds of similar molecular weight , such as propane .
ethanol is slightly more refractive than water , having a refractive index of *num* .
*num* ( at λ=589 .
*num* nm and ) .
the triple point for ethanol is at a pressure of .
ethanol is a versatile solvent , miscible with water and with many organic solvents , including acetic acid , acetone , benzene , carbon tetrachloride , chloroform , diethyl ether , ethylene glycol , glycerol , nitromethane , pyridine , and toluene .
it is also miscible with light aliphatic hydrocarbons , such as pentane and hexane , and with aliphatic chlorides such as trichloroethane and tetrachloroethylene .
ethanol's miscibility with water contrasts with the immiscibility of longer-chain alcohols ( five or more carbon atoms ) , whose water miscibility decreases sharply as the number of carbons increases .
the miscibility of ethanol with alkanes is limited to alkanes up to undecane : mixtures with dodecane and higher alkanes show a miscibility gap below a certain temperature ( about *num* °c for dodecane ) .
the miscibility gap tends to get wider with higher alkanes and the temperature for complete miscibility increases .
ethanol-water mixtures have less volume than the sum of their individual components at the given fractions .
mixing equal volumes of ethanol and water results in only *num* .
*num* volumes of mixture .
mixing ethanol and water is exothermic , with up to *num* j / mol being released at *num* k .
mixtures of ethanol and water form an azeotrope at about *num* mole- % ethanol and *num* mole- % water or a mixture of *num* .
*num* percent ethanol by mass ( or about *num* % alcohol by volume ) at normal pressure , which boils at 351k ( *num* °c ) .
this azeotropic composition is strongly temperature- and pressure-dependent and vanishes at temperatures below *num* k .
hydrogen bonding causes pure ethanol to be hygroscopic to the extent that it readily absorbs water from the air .
the polar nature of the hydroxyl group causes ethanol to dissolve many ionic compounds , notably sodium and potassium hydroxides , magnesium chloride , calcium chloride , ammonium chloride , ammonium bromide , and sodium bromide .
sodium and potassium chlorides are slightly soluble in ethanol .
because the ethanol molecule also has a nonpolar end , it will also dissolve nonpolar substances , including most essential oils and numerous flavoring , coloring , and medicinal agents .
the addition of even a few percent of ethanol to water sharply reduces the surface tension of water .
this property partially explains the " tears of wine " phenomenon .
when wine is swirled in a glass , ethanol evaporates quickly from the thin film of wine on the wall of the glass .
as the wine's ethanol content decreases , its surface tension increases and the thin film " beads up " and runs down the glass in channels rather than as a smooth sheet .
an ethanol-water solution that contains *num* % alcohol by weight ( about *num* % by volume ) will catch fire if heated to about and if an ignition source is applied to it .
this is called its flash point .
the flash point of pure ethanol is , less than average room temperature .
dishes using burning alcohol for culinary effects are called flambé .
ethanol is a byproduct of the metabolic process of yeast .
as such , ethanol will be present in any yeast habitat .
ethanol can commonly be found in overripe fruit .
ethanol produced by symbiotic yeast can be found in bertam palm blossoms .
although some animal species such as the pentailed treeshrew exhibit ethanol-seeking behaviors , most show no interest or avoidance of food sources containing ethanol .
ethanol is also produced during the germination of many plants as a result of natural anerobiosis .
ethanol has been detected in outer space , forming an icy coating around dust grains in interstellar clouds .
minute quantity amounts ( average *num* ppb ) of endogenous ethanol and acetaldehyde were found in the exhaled breath of healthy volunteers .
auto-brewery syndrome , also known as gut fermentation syndrome , is a rare medical condition in which intoxicating quantities of ethanol are produced through endogenous fermentation within the digestive system .
ethanol is produced both as a petrochemical , through the hydration of ethylene and , via biological processes , by fermenting sugars with yeast .
which process is more economical depends on prevailing prices of petroleum and grain feed stocks .
in the 1970s most industrial ethanol in the united states was made as a petrochemical , but in the 1980s the united states introduced subsidies for corn-based ethanol and today it is almost all made from that source .
ethanol for use as an industrial feedstock or solvent ( sometimes referred to as synthetic ethanol ) is made from petrochemical feed stocks , primarily by the acid-catalyzed hydration of ethylene : the catalyst is most commonly phosphoric acid , adsorbed onto a porous support such as silica gel or diatomaceous earth .
this catalyst was first used for large-scale ethanol production by the shell oil company in *num* .
the reaction is carried out in the presence of high pressure steam at where a *num* : *num* ethylene to steam ratio is maintained .
in the u .
s .
, this process was used on an industrial scale by union carbide corporation and others , but now only lyondellbasell uses it commercially .
in an older process , first practiced on the industrial scale in *num* by union carbide , but now almost entirely obsolete , ethylene was hydrated indirectly by reacting it with concentrated sulfuric acid to produce ethyl sulfate , which was hydrolyzed to yield ethanol and regenerate the sulfuric acid : co can also be used as the raw material .
co can be reduced by hydrogen to produce ethanol , acetic acid , and smaller amounts of *num* , 3-butanediol and lactic acid using " clostridium ljungdahlii " , " clostridium autoethanogenum " or " moorella " sp .
huc22-1 .
co can be converted using electrochemical reactions at room temperature and pressure .
in a system developed at delft university of technology , a copper nanowire array used as a cathode adsorbs molecules of carbon dioxide and reduced intermediate species such as co and coh .
however , even in the best results about half the current went into producing hydrogen and only a small amount of ethanol was produced .
other products , produced in larger quantities , were ( in decreasing order ) formic acid , ethylene , co , and n-propanol .
lipids can also be used to make ethanol and can be found in such raw materials such as algae .
ethanol in alcoholic beverages and fuel is produced by fermentation .
certain species of yeast ( e .
g .
, " saccharomyces cerevisiae " ) metabolize sugar , producing ethanol and carbon dioxide .
the chemical equations below summarize the conversion : fermentation is the process of culturing yeast under favorable thermal conditions to produce alcohol .
this process is carried out at around .
toxicity of ethanol to yeast limits the ethanol concentration obtainable by brewing ; higher concentrations , therefore , are obtained by fortification or distillation .
the most ethanol-tolerant yeast strains can survive up to approximately *num* % ethanol by volume .
to produce ethanol from starchy materials such as cereal grains , the starch must first be converted into sugars .
in brewing beer , this has traditionally been accomplished by allowing the grain to germinate , or malt , which produces the enzyme amylase .
when the malted grain is mashed , the amylase converts the remaining starches into sugars .
sugars for ethanol fermentation can be obtained from cellulose .
deployment of this technology could turn a number of cellulose-containing agricultural by-products , such as corncobs , straw , and sawdust , into renewable energy resources .
other agricultural residues such as sugar cane bagasse and energy crops such as switchgrass may also be a sources of fermentable sugars .
breweries and biofuel plants employ two methods for measuring ethanol concentration .
infrared ethanol sensors measure the vibrational frequency of dissolved ethanol using the ch band at *num* cm .
this method uses a relatively inexpensive solid state sensor that compares the ch band with a reference band to calculate the ethanol content .
the calculation makes use of the beer-lambert law .
alternatively , by measuring the density of the starting material and the density of the product , using a hydrometer , the change in specific gravity during fermentation indicates the alcohol content .
this inexpensive and indirect method has a long history in the beer brewing industry .
ethylene hydration or brewing produces an ethanol–water mixture .
for most industrial and fuel uses , the ethanol must be purified .
fractional distillation at atmospheric pressure can concentrate ethanol to *num* .
*num* % by weight ( *num* .
*num* mole % ) .
this mixture is an azeotrope with a boiling point of , and " cannot " be further purified by distillation .
addition of an entraining agent , such as benzene , cyclohexane , or heptane , allows a new ternary azeotrope comprising the ethanol , water , and the entraining agent to be formed .
this lower-boiling ternary azeotrope is removed preferentially , leading to water-free ethanol .
at pressures less than atmospheric pressure , the composition of the ethanol-water azeotrope shifts to more ethanol-rich mixtures , and at pressures less than *num* torr ( *num* .
*num* kpa ) , there is no azeotrope , and it is possible to distill absolute ethanol from an ethanol-water mixture .
while vacuum distillation of ethanol is not presently economical , pressure-swing distillation is a topic of current research .
in this technique , a reduced-pressure distillation first yields an ethanol-water mixture of more than *num* .
*num* % ethanol .
then , fractional distillation of this mixture at atmospheric pressure distills off the *num* .
*num* % azeotrope , leaving anhydrous ethanol at the bottom .
apart from distillation , ethanol may be dried by addition of a desiccant , such as molecular sieves , cellulose , and cornmeal .
the desiccants can be dried and reused .
molecular sieves can be used to selectively absorb the water from the *num* .
*num* % ethanol solution .
synthetic zeolite in pellet form can be used , as well as a variety of plant-derived absorbents , including cornmeal , straw , and sawdust .
the zeolite bed can be regenerated essentially an unlimited number of times by drying it with a blast of hot carbon dioxide .
cornmeal and other plant-derived absorbents cannot readily be regenerated , but where ethanol is made from grain , they are often available at low cost .
absolute ethanol produced this way has no residual benzene , and can be used to fortify port and sherry in traditional winery operations .
membranes can also be used to separate ethanol and water .
membrane-based separations are not subject to the limitations of the water-ethanol azeotrope because the separations are not based on vapor-liquid equilibria .
membranes are often used in the so-called hybrid membrane distillation process .
this process uses a pre-concentration distillation column as first separating step .
the further separation is then accomplished with a membrane operated either in vapor permeation or pervaporation mode .
vapor permeation uses a vapor membrane feed and pervaporation uses a liquid membrane feed .
a variety of other techniques have been discussed , including the following : pure ethanol and alcoholic beverages are heavily taxed as psychoactive drugs , but ethanol has many uses that do not involve its consumption .
to relieve the tax burden on these uses , most jurisdictions waive the tax when an agent has been added to the ethanol to render it unfit to drink .
these include bittering agents such as denatonium benzoate and toxins such as methanol , naphtha , and pyridine .
products of this kind are called " denatured alcohol .
" absolute or anhydrous alcohol refers to ethanol with a low water content .
there are various grades with maximum water contents ranging from *num* % to a few parts per million ( ppm ) levels .
if azeotropic distillation is used to remove water , it will contain trace amounts of the material separation agent ( e .
g .
benzene ) .
absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption .
absolute ethanol is used as a solvent for laboratory and industrial applications , where water will react with other chemicals , and as fuel alcohol .
spectroscopic ethanol is an absolute ethanol with a low absorbance in ultraviolet and visible light , fit for use as a solvent in ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy .
pure ethanol is classed as *num* proof in the u .
s .
, equivalent to *num* degrees proof in the uk system .
rectified spirit , an azeotropic composition of *num* % ethanol containing *num* % water , is used instead of anhydrous ethanol for various purposes .
wine spirits are about *num* % ethanol ( *num* proof ) .
the impurities are different from those in *num* % ( *num* proof ) laboratory ethanol .
ethanol is classified as a primary alcohol , meaning that the carbon its hydroxyl group attaches to has at least two hydrogen atoms attached to it as well .
many ethanol reactions occur at its hydroxyl group .
in the presence of acid catalysts , ethanol reacts with carboxylic acids to produce ethyl esters and water : this reaction , which is conducted on large scale industrially , requires the removal of the water from the reaction mixture as it is formed .
esters react in the presence of an acid or base to give back the alcohol and a salt .
this reaction is known as saponification because it is used in the preparation of soap .
ethanol can also form esters with inorganic acids .
diethyl sulfate and triethyl phosphate are prepared by treating ethanol with sulfur trioxide and phosphorus pentoxide respectively .
diethyl sulfate is a useful ethylating agent in organic synthesis .
ethyl nitrite , prepared from the reaction of ethanol with sodium nitrite and sulfuric acid , was formerly used as a diuretic .
in the presence of acid catalysts , ethanol converts to ethylene .
typically solid acids such as silica are used : ethylene produced in this way competes with ethylene from oil refineries and fracking .
under alternative conditions , diethyl ether results : complete combustion of ethanol forms carbon dioxide and water : specific heat = *num* .
*num* kj / ( kg·k ) ethanol is a neutral molecule and the ph of a solution of ethanol in water is nearly *num* .
*num* .
ethanol can be quantitatively converted to its conjugate base , the ethoxide ion ( chcho ) , by reaction with an alkali metal such as sodium : or a very strong base such as sodium hydride : the acidity of water and ethanol are nearly the same , as indicated by their pka of *num* .
*num* and *num* respectively .
thus , sodium ethoxide and sodium hydroxide exist in an equilibrium that is closely balanced : ethanol is not used industrially as a precursor to ethyl halides , but the reactions are illustrative .
ethanol reacts with hydrogen halides to produce ethyl halides such as ethyl chloride and ethyl bromide via an s2 reaction : these reactions require a catalyst such as zinc chloride .
hbr requires refluxing with a sulfuric acid catalyst .
ethyl halides can , in principle , also be produced by treating ethanol with more specialized halogenating agents , such as thionyl chloride or phosphorus tribromide .
upon treatment with halogens in the presence of base , ethanol gives the corresponding haloform ( chx , where x = cl , br , i ) .
this conversion is called the haloform reaction .
" an intermediate in the reaction with chlorine is the aldehyde called chloral , which forms chloral hydrate upon reaction with water : ethanol can be oxidized to acetaldehyde and further oxidized to acetic acid , depending on the reagents and conditions .
this oxidation is of no importance industrially , but in the human body , these oxidation reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme liver alcohol dehydrogenase .
the oxidation product of ethanol , acetic acid , is a nutrient for humans , being a precursor to acetyl coa , where the acetyl group can be spent as energy or used for biosynthesis .
pure ethanol will irritate the skin and eyes .
nausea , vomiting , and intoxication are symptoms of ingestion .
long-term use by ingestion can result in serious liver damage .
atmospheric concentrations above one in a thousand are above the european union occupational exposure limits .
the fermentation of sugar into ethanol is one of the earliest biotechnologies employed by humans .
the intoxicating effects of ethanol consumption have been known since ancient times .
ethanol has been used by humans since prehistory as the intoxicating ingredient of alcoholic beverages .
dried residue on *num* , 000-year-old pottery found in china suggests that neolithic people consumed alcoholic beverages .
the medieval muslims used the distillation process extensively , and applied it to the distillation of alcohol .
the arab chemist al-kindi unambiguously described the distillation of wine in the *ord* century .
the process later spread from the middle east to italy .
production of alcohol from distilled wine was later recorded by the school of salerno alchemists in the *ord* century .
mention of absolute alcohol , in contrast with alcohol-water mixtures , was later made by raymond lull in the *ord* century .
in china , archaeological evidence indicates that the true distillation of alcohol began during the *ord* century jin or southern song dynasties .
a still has been found at an archaeological site in qinglong , hebei , dating to the *ord* century .
in india , the true distillation of alcohol was introduced from the middle east , and was in wide use in the delhi sultanate by the *ord* century .
in *num* , german-russian chemist johann tobias lowitz obtained pure ethanol by mixing partially purified ethanol ( the alcohol-water azeotrope ) with an excess of anhydrous alkali and then distilling the mixture over low heat .
french chemist antoine lavoisier described ethanol as a compound of carbon , hydrogen , and oxygen , and in *num* nicolas-théodore de saussure determined ethanol's chemical formula .
fifty years later , archibald scott couper published the structural formula of ethanol .
it was one of the first structural formulas determined .
ethanol was first prepared synthetically in *num* by michael faraday .
he found that sulfuric acid could absorb large volumes of coal gas .
he gave the resulting solution to henry hennell , a british chemist , who found in *num* that it contained " sulphovinic acid " ( ethyl hydrogen sulfate ) .
in *num* , hennell and the french chemist georges-simon serullas independently discovered that sulphovinic acid could be decomposed into ethanol .
thus , in *num* faraday had unwittingly discovered that ethanol could be produced from ethylene ( a component of coal gas ) by acid-catalyzed hydration , a process similar to current industrial ethanol synthesis .
ethanol was used as lamp fuel in the united states as early as *num* , but a tax levied on industrial alcohol during the civil war made this use uneconomical .
the tax was repealed in *num* .
use as an automotive fuel dates back to *num* , with the ford model t able to run on petrol ( gasoline ) or ethanol .
it fuels some spirit lamps .
ethanol intended for industrial use is often produced from ethylene .
ethanol has widespread use as a solvent of substances intended for human contact or consumption , including scents , flavorings , colorings , and medicines .
in chemistry , it is both a solvent and a feedstock for the synthesis of other products .
it has a long history as a fuel for heat and light , and more recently as a fuel for internal combustion engines .
falklands war the falklands war ( ) , also known as the falklands conflict , falklands crisis , malvinas war , south atlantic conflict , and the guerra del atlántico sur ( spanish for " south atlantic war " ) , was a ten-week war between argentina and the united kingdom over two british dependent territories in the south atlantic : the falkland islands , and its territorial dependency , the south georgia and the south sandwich islands .
it began on friday , *num* april *num* , when argentina invaded and occupied the falkland islands ( and , the following day , south georgia and the south sandwich islands ) in an attempt to establish the sovereignty it had claimed over them .
on *num* april , the british government dispatched a naval task force to engage the argentine navy and air force before making an amphibious assault on the islands .
the conflict lasted *num* days and ended with the argentine surrender on *num* june *num* , returning the islands to british control .
in total , *num* argentine military personnel , *num* british military personnel , and three falkland islanders died during the hostilities .
the conflict was a major episode in the protracted confrontation over the territories ' sovereignty .
argentina asserted ( and maintains ) that the islands are argentine territory , and the argentine government thus characterised its military action as the reclamation of its own territory .
the british government regarded the action as an invasion of a territory that had been a crown colony since *num* .
falkland islanders , who have inhabited the islands since the early *ord* century , are predominantly descendants of british settlers , and strongly favour british sovereignty .
neither state officially declared war , although both governments declared the islands a war zone .
hostilities were almost exclusively limited to the territories under dispute and the area of the south atlantic where they lie .
the conflict has had a strong effect in both countries and has been the subject of various books , articles , films , and songs .
patriotic sentiment ran high in argentina , but the outcome prompted large protests against the ruling military government , hastening its downfall .
in the united kingdom , the conservative government , bolstered by the successful outcome , was re-elected with an increased majority the following year .
the cultural and political effect of the conflict has been less in the uk than in argentina , where it remains a common topic for discussion .
diplomatic relations between the united kingdom and argentina were restored in *num* following a meeting in madrid , at which the two governments issued a joint statement .
no change in either country's position regarding the sovereignty of the falkland islands was made explicit .
in *num* , argentina's claim to the territories was added to its constitution .
in the period leading up to the war—and , in particular , following the transfer of power between the military dictators general jorge rafael videla and general roberto eduardo viola late in march 1981—argentina had been in the midst of a devastating economic stagnation and large-scale civil unrest against the military " junta " that had been governing the country since *num* .
in december *num* there was a further change in the argentine military regime , bringing to office a new " junta " headed by general leopoldo galtieri ( acting president ) , air brigadier basilio lami dozo and admiral jorge anaya .
anaya was the main architect and supporter of a military solution for the long-standing claim over the islands , calculating that the united kingdom would never respond militarily .
by opting for military action , the galtieri government hoped to mobilise the long-standing patriotic feelings of argentines towards the islands , and thus divert public attention from the country's chronic economic problems and the regime's ongoing human rights violations of the dirty war .
such action would also bolster its dwindling legitimacy .
the newspaper " la prensa " speculated in a step-by-step plan beginning with cutting off supplies to the islands , ending in direct actions late in *num* , if the un talks were fruitless .
the ongoing tension between the two countries over the islands increased on *num* march when a group of argentine scrap metal merchants ( actually infiltrated by argentine marines ) raised the argentine flag at south georgia island , an act that would later be seen as the first offensive action in the war .
the royal navy ice patrol vessel was dispatched from stanley to south georgia on the *ord* in response .
the argentine military junta , suspecting that the uk would reinforce its south atlantic forces , ordered the invasion of the falkland islands to be brought forward to *num* april .
the uk was initially taken by surprise by the argentine attack on the south atlantic islands , despite repeated warnings by royal navy captain nicholas barker ( commander of the " endurance " ) and others .
barker believed that defence secretary john nott's *num* review ( in which nott described plans to withdraw the " endurance " , the uk's only naval presence in the south atlantic ) had sent a signal to the argentines that the uk was unwilling , and would soon be unable , to defend its territories and subjects in the falklands .
on *num* april *num* , argentine forces mounted amphibious landings , known as operation rosario , on the falkland islands .
the invasion was met with a nominal defence organised by the falkland islands ' governor sir rex hunt , giving command to major mike norman of the royal marines .
the events of the invasion included the landing of lieutenant commander guillermo sanchez-sabarots ' amphibious commandos group , the attack on moody brook barracks , the engagement between the troops of hugo santillan and bill trollope at stanley , and the final engagement and surrender at government house .
word of the invasion first reached the uk from argentine sources .
a ministry of defence operative in london had a short telex conversation with governor hunt's telex operator , who confirmed that argentines were on the island and in control .
later that day , bbc journalist laurie margolis spoke with an islander at goose green via amateur radio , who confirmed the presence of a large argentine fleet and that argentine forces had taken control of the island .
british military operations in the falklands war were given the codename " operation corporate " , and the commander of the task force was admiral sir john fieldhouse .
operations lasted from *num* april *num* to *num* june *num* .
the british undertook a series of military operations as a means of recapturing the falklands from argentine occupation , though the british had already taken action prior to the *num* april invasion .
in response to events on south georgia , the submarines and were ordered to sail south on *num* march , whereas the stores ship royal fleet auxiliary ( rfa ) " fort austin " was dispatched from the western mediterranean to support hms " endurance " .
lord carrington had wished to send a third submarine , but the decision was deferred due to concerns about the impact on operational commitments .
coincidentally , on *num* march , the submarine left gibraltar and it was assumed in the press it was heading south .
there has since been speculation that the effect of those reports was to panic the argentine junta into invading the falklands before nuclear-powered submarines could be deployed .
the following day , during a crisis meeting headed by the prime minister margaret thatcher , the chief of the naval staff , admiral sir henry leach , advised them that " britain could and should send a task force if the islands are invaded " .
on *num* april , leach sent orders to a royal navy force carrying out exercises in the mediterranean to prepare to sail south .
following the invasion on *num* april , after an emergency meeting of the cabinet , approval was given to form a task force to retake the islands .
this was backed in an emergency session of the house of commons the next day .
on *num* april , the british government set up a war cabinet to provide day-to-day political oversight of the campaign .
this was the critical instrument of crisis management for the british with its remit being to " keep under review political and military developments relating to the south atlantic , and to report as necessary to the defence and overseas policy committee " .
the war cabinet met at least daily until it was dissolved on *num* august .
although margaret thatcher is described as dominating the war cabinet , lawrence freedman notes in the " official history of the falklands campaign " that she did not ignore opposition or fail to consult others .
however , once a decision was reached she " did not look back " .
on the evening of *num* april , the united kingdom's united nations ambassador sir anthony parsons put a draft resolution to the united nations security council .
the resolution , which condemned the hostilities and demanded the immediate argentine withdrawal from the islands , was adopted by the council the following day as united nations security council resolution *num* , which passed with ten votes in support , one against ( panama ) and four abstentions ( china , the soviet union , poland and spain ) .
the uk received further political support from member countries of the commonwealth of nations and the european economic community .
australia , canada , and new zealand withdrew their diplomats from buenos aires .
the eec also provided economic support by imposing economic sanctions on argentina .
argentina itself was politically backed by a majority of countries in latin america ( though not , crucially , chile ) and some members of the non-aligned movement .
the new zealand government expelled the argentinian ambassador following the invasion .
the prime minister , robert muldoon , was in london when the war broke out and in an opinion piece published in " the times " he said : " the military rulers of argentina must not be appeased … new zealand will back britain all the way .
" broadcasting on the bbc world service , he told the falkland islanders : " this is rob muldoon .
we are thinking of you and we are giving our full and total support to the british government in its endeavours to rectify this situation and get rid of the people who have invaded your country .
” on *num* may *num* , he announced that new zealand would make , a leander-class frigate , available for use where the british thought fit to release a royal navy vessel for the falklands .
in the house of commons afterwards , margaret thatcher said : “…the new zealand government and people have been absolutely magnificent in their support for this country [ and ] the falkland islanders , for the rule of liberty and of law” .
the french president , francois mitterrand , declared an embargo on french arms sales and assistance to argentina .
in addition , france allowed uk aircraft and warships use of its port and airfield facilities at dakar in senegal and france provided dissimilar aircraft training so that harrier pilots could train against the french aircraft used by argentina .
french intelligence also cooperated with britain to prevent argentina from obtaining more exocet missiles on the international market .
in a *num* interview , and in reference to this support , john nott , the then british defence secretary , had described france as britain's ' greatest ally ' .
in *num* , it came to light that while this support was taking place , a french technical team , employed by dassault and already in argentina , remained there throughout the war despite the presidential decree .
the team had provided material support to the argentines , identifying and fixing faults in exocet missile launchers .
john nott said he had known the french team was there but said its work was thought not to be of any importance .
an adviser to the then french government denied any knowledge at the time that the technical team was there .
in contrast , a then french intelligence officer maintained he knew the team was there but it was in an intelligence-gathering capacity .
john nott , when asked if he regretted his earlier praise of the french , said he thought the french were " duplicitous " , and " always have been " .
the sierra leone government allowed task force ships to refuel at freetown .
vc10 transport aircraft landed at banjul in the gambia while flying between the uk and ascension island .
the war was an unexpected event in a world strained by the cold war and the north–south divide .
the response of some countries was the effort to mediate the crisis and later as the war began , the support ( or criticism ) based in terms of anti-colonialism , political solidarity , historical relationships or realpolitik .
the united states was concerned that a protracted conflict could draw the soviet union on argentina's side , and initially tried to mediate an end to the conflict through " shuttle diplomacy " .
however , when argentina refused the u .
s .
peace overtures , u .
s .
secretary of state alexander haig announced that the united states would prohibit arms sales to argentina and provide material support for british operations .
both houses of the u .
s .
congress passed resolutions supporting the u .
s .
action siding with the united kingdom .
the u .
s .
provided the united kingdom with sidewinder missiles for use by the harrier jets .
president ronald reagan approved the royal navy's request to borrow the sea harrier-capable amphibious assault ship if the british lost an aircraft carrier .
the united states navy developed a plan to help the british man the ship with american military contractors , likely retired sailors with knowledge of " iwo jima"s systems .
peru attempted to purchase *num* missiles for argentina , in a failed secret operation .
chile gave support to the uk in the form of intelligence about the argentine military and early warning intelligence on argentine air movements .
throughout the war , argentina was afraid of a chilean military intervention in patagonia and kept some of its best mountain regiments away from the falklands near the chilean border as a precaution .
according to the book " operation israel " , advisers from israel aerospace industries were already in argentina and continued their work during the conflict .
the book also claims that israel sold weapons and drop tanks in a secret operation in peru .
peru also openly sent " mirages , pilots and missiles " to argentina during the war .
peru had earlier transferred ten hercules transport planes to argentina soon after the british task force had set sail in april *num* .
nick van der bijl records that , after the argentine defeat at goose green , venezuela and guatemala offered to send paratroopers to the falklands .
through libya , under muammar gaddafi , argentina received *num* launchers and *num* sa-7 missiles , as well as machine guns , mortars and mines ; all in all , the load of four trips of two boeing 707s of the aaf , refuelled in recife with the knowledge and consent of the brazilian government .
some of these clandestine logistics operations were mounted by the soviet union .
the british government had no contingency plan for an invasion of the islands , and the task force was rapidly put together from whatever vessels were available .
the nuclear-powered submarine set sail from france on *num* april , whilst the two aircraft carriers and , in the company of escort vessels , left portsmouth only a day later .
on its return to southampton from a world cruise on *num* april , the ocean liner was requisitioned and set sail two days later with *num* commando brigade aboard .
the ocean liner " queen elizabeth *num* " was also requisitioned and left southampton on *num* may with *ord* infantry brigade on board .
the whole task force eventually comprised *num* ships : *num* royal navy vessels , *num* royal fleet auxiliary ships and *num* merchant ships .
the retaking of the falkland islands was considered extremely difficult .
the u .
s .
navy considered a successful counter-invasion by the british " a military impossibility " .
firstly , the british were significantly constrained by the disparity in deployable air cover .
the british had *num* aircraft ( *num* sea harriers and *num* harrier gr .
3s ) available for air combat operations , against approximately *num* serviceable jet fighters , of which about *num* were used as air superiority fighters and the remainder as strike aircraft , in argentina's air forces during the war .
crucially , the british lacked airborne early warning and control ( aew ) aircraft .
planning also considered the argentine surface fleet and the threat posed by exocet-equipped vessels or the two type *num* submarines .
by mid-april , the royal air force had set up the airbase of raf ascension island , co-located with wideawake airfield on the mid-atlantic british overseas territory of ascension island , including a sizeable force of avro vulcan b mk *num* bombers , handley page victor k mk *num* refuelling aircraft , and mcdonnell douglas phantom fgr mk *num* fighters to protect them .
meanwhile , the main british naval task force arrived at ascension to prepare for active service .
a small force had already been sent south to recapture south georgia .
encounters began in april ; the british task force was shadowed by boeing *num* aircraft of the argentine air force during their travel to the south .
several of these flights were intercepted by sea harriers outside the british-imposed exclusion zone ; the unarmed 707s were not attacked because diplomatic moves were still in progress and the uk had not yet decided to commit itself to armed force .
on *num* april , a brazilian commercial douglas dc-10 from varig airlines en route to south africa was intercepted by british harriers who visually identified the civilian plane .
the south georgia force , " operation paraquet " , under the command of major guy sheridan rm , consisted of marines from *num* commando , a troop of the special air service ( sas ) and special boat service ( sbs ) troops who were intended to land as reconnaissance forces for an invasion by the royal marines .
all were embarked on .
first to arrive was the hms " conqueror " on *num* april , and the island was over-flown by a radar-mapping handley page victor on *num* april .
the first landings of sas troops took place on *num* april , but—with the southern hemisphere autumn setting in—the weather was so bad that their landings and others made the next day were all withdrawn after two helicopters crashed in fog on fortuna glacier .
on *num* april , a submarine alert was sounded and operations were halted , with " tidespring " being withdrawn to deeper water to avoid interception .
on *num* april , the british forces regrouped and headed in to attack .
on *num* april , after resupplying the argentine garrison in south georgia , the submarine was spotted on the surface by a westland wessex has mk *num* helicopter from , which attacked the argentine submarine with depth charges .
launched a westland wasp has .
mk .
*num* helicopter , and launched a westland lynx has mk *num* .
the lynx launched a torpedo , and strafed the submarine with its pintle-mounted general purpose machine gun ; the wessex also fired on " santa fe " with its gpmg .
the wasp from as well as two other wasps launched from fired as-12 asm antiship missiles at the submarine , scoring hits .
" santa fe " was damaged badly enough to prevent her from diving .
the crew abandoned the submarine at the jetty at king edward point on south georgia .
with " tidespring " now far out to sea , and the argentine forces augmented by the submarine's crew , major sheridan decided to gather the *num* men he had and make a direct assault that day .
after a short forced march by the british troops and a naval bombardment demonstration by two royal navy vessels ( " antrim " and " plymouth " ) , the argentine forces surrendered without resistance .
the message sent from the naval force at south georgia to london was , " be pleased to inform her majesty that the white ensign flies alongside the union jack in south georgia .
god save the queen .
" the prime minister , margaret thatcher , broke the news to the media , telling them to " just rejoice at that news , and congratulate our forces and the marines ! " on *num* may , british operations on the falklands opened with the " black buck *num* " attack ( of a series of five ) on the airfield at stanley .
a vulcan bomber from ascension flew on an round trip dropping conventional bombs across the runway at stanley and back to ascension .
the mission required repeated refuelling , and required several victor k2 tanker aircraft operating in concert , including tanker to tanker refuelling .
the overall effect of the raids on the war is difficult to determine , and the raids consumed precious tanker resources from ascension , but also prevented argentina from stationing fast jets on the islands .
historian lawrence freedman , who was given access to official sources comments that the significance of the vulcan raids remains controversial .
although taking pressure off the small sea harrier force , the raids were costly and used a great deal of resources .
the single hit in the centre of the runway was probably the best that could have been expected but it did reduce the capability of the runway to operate fast jets and caused the argentine air force to deploy mirage iii to defend the capital .
argentine sources confirm that the vulcan raids influenced argentina to withdraw some of its mirage iiis from southern argentina to the buenos aires defence zone .
this dissuasive effect was watered down when british officials made clear that there would not be strikes on air bases in argentina .
the raids were later dismissed as propaganda by falklands veteran commander nigel ward .
of the five black buck raids , three were against stanley airfield , with the other two anti-radar missions using shrike anti-radiation missiles .
the falklands had only three airfields .
the longest and only paved runway was at the capital , stanley , and even that was too short to support fast jets ( although an arrestor gear was fitted in april to support skyhawks ) .
therefore , the argentines were forced to launch their major strikes from the mainland , severely hampering their efforts at forward staging , combat air patrols , and close air support over the islands .
the effective loiter time of incoming argentine aircraft was low , and they were later compelled to overfly british forces in any attempt to attack the islands .
the first major argentine strike force comprised *num* aircraft ( a-4 skyhawks , iai daggers , english electric canberras , and mirage iii escorts ) , and was sent on *num* may , in the belief that the british invasion was imminent or landings had already taken place .
only a section of grupo *num* ( flying iai dagger aircraft ) found ships , which were firing at argentine defences near the islands .
the daggers managed to attack the ships and return safely .
this greatly boosted morale of the argentine pilots , who now knew they could survive an attack against modern warships , protected by radar ground clutter from the islands and by using a late pop up profile .
meanwhile , other argentine aircraft were intercepted by bae sea harriers operating from .
a dagger and a canberra were shot down .
combat broke out between sea harrier frs mk *num* fighters of no .
*num* naval air squadron and mirage iii fighters of grupo *num* .
both sides refused to fight at the other's best altitude , until two mirages finally descended to engage .
one was shot down by an aim-9l sidewinder air-to-air missile ( aam ) , while the other escaped but was damaged and without enough fuel to return to its mainland air base .
the plane made for stanley , where it fell victim to friendly fire from the argentine defenders .
as a result of this experience , argentine air force staff decided to employ a-4 skyhawks and daggers only as strike units , the canberras only during the night , and mirage iiis ( without air refuelling capability or any capable aam ) as decoys to lure away the british sea harriers .
the decoying would be later extended with the formation of the escuadrón fénix , a squadron of civilian jets flying *num* hours-a-day simulating strike aircraft preparing to attack the fleet .
on one of these flights on *num* june , an air force learjet 35a was shot down , killing the squadron commander , vice commodore rodolfo de la colina , the highest-ranking argentine officer to die in the war .
stanley was used as an argentine strongpoint throughout the conflict .
despite the black buck and harrier raids on stanley airfield ( no fast jets were stationed there for air defence ) and overnight shelling by detached ships , it was never out of action entirely .
stanley was defended by a mixture of surface-to-air missile ( sam ) systems ( franco-german roland and british tigercat ) and swiss-built oerlikon *num* mm twin anti-aircraft cannons .
lockheed hercules transport night flights brought supplies , weapons , vehicles , and fuel , and airlifted out the wounded up until the end of the conflict .
the only argentine hercules shot down by the british was lost on *num* june when tc-63 was intercepted by a sea harrier in daylight when it was searching for the british fleet north-east of the islands after the argentine navy retired its last sp-2h neptune due to airframe attrition .
various options to attack the home base of the five argentine etendards at río grande were examined and discounted ( operation mikado ) , subsequently five royal navy submarines lined up , submerged , on the edge of argentina's territorial limit to provide early warning of bombing raids on the british task force .
two british naval task forces ( one of surface vessels and one of submarines ) and the argentine fleet were operating in the neighbourhood of the falklands and soon came into conflict .
the first naval loss was the second world war-vintage argentine light cruiser .
the nuclear-powered submarine sank " general belgrano " on *num* may .
three hundred and twenty-three members of " general belgrano"s crew died in the incident .
more than *num* men were rescued from the open ocean despite cold seas and stormy weather .
the losses from " general belgrano " totalled nearly half of the argentine deaths in the falklands conflict and the loss of the ship hardened the stance of the argentine government .
regardless of controversies over the sinking—including disagreement about the exact nature of the maritime exclusion zone and whether " general belgrano " had been returning to port at the time of the sinking—it had a crucial strategic effect : the elimination of the argentine naval threat .
after her loss , the entire argentine fleet , with the exception of the diesel-powered submarine , returned to port and did not leave again during the fighting .
the two escorting destroyers and the battle group centred on the aircraft carrier both withdrew from the area , ending the direct threat to the british fleet that their pincer movement had represented .
however , settling the controversy in *num* , the ship's captain hector bonzo confirmed that " general belgrano " had actually been manoeuvering , not " sailing away " from the exclusion zone , and had orders to sink " any british ship he could find " .
further , captain bonzo stated that any suggestion that hms " conqueror " actions were a " betrayal " was utterly wrong ; rather , the submarine carried out its duties according to the accepted rules of war .
in a separate incident later that night , british forces engaged an argentine patrol gunboat , the , that was searching for the crew of the argentine air force canberra light bomber shot down on *num* may .
two royal navy lynx helicopters fired four sea skua missiles at her .
badly damaged and with eight crew dead , " alferez sobral " managed to return to puerto deseado two days later .
the canberra's crew were never found .
on *num* may , two days after the sinking of " general belgrano " , the british lost the type *num* destroyer to fire following an exocet missile strike from the argentine *ord* naval air fighter / attack squadron .
"sheffield " had been ordered forward with two other type 42s to provide a long-range radar and medium-high altitude missile picket far from the british carriers .
she was struck amidships , with devastating effect , ultimately killing *num* crew members and severely injuring *num* others .
the ship was abandoned several hours later , gutted and deformed by the fires that continued to burn for six more days .
she finally sank outside the maritime exclusion zone on *num* may .
the incident is described in detail by admiral sandy woodward in his book " one hundred days " , in chapter one .
woodward was a former commanding officer of " sheffield " .
the destruction of " sheffield " ( the first royal navy ship sunk in action since the second world war ) had a profound impact on the british public , bringing home the fact that the " falklands crisis " , as the bbc news put it , was now an actual " shooting war " .
the tempo of operations increased throughout the first half of may as the united nations ' attempts to mediate a peace were rejected by the argentinians .
the final british negotiating position was presented to argentina by un secretary general pérez de cuéllar on *num* may *num* .
in it , the british abandoned their previous " red-line " that british administration of the islands should be restored on the withdrawal of argentinian forces , as supported by united nations security council resolution *num* .
instead , it proposed a un administrator should supervise the mutual withdrawal of both argentinian and british forces , then govern the islands in consultation with the representative institutions of the islands , including argentines , although no argentines lived there .
reference to " self-determination " of the islanders was dropped and the british proposed that future negotiations over the sovereignty of the islands should be conducted by the un .
given the threat to the british fleet posed by the etendard-exocet combination , plans were made to use c-130s to fly in some sas troops to attack the home base of the five etendards at río grande , tierra del fuego .
the operation was codenamed " mikado " .
the operation was later scrapped , after acknowledging that its chances of success were limited , and replaced with a plan to use the submarine to drop sas operatives several miles offshore at night for them to make their way to the coast aboard rubber inflatables and proceed to destroy argentina's remaining exocet stockpile .
an sas reconnaissance team was dispatched to carry out preparations for a seaborne infiltration .
a westland sea king helicopter carrying the assigned team took off from hms " invincible " on the night of *num* may , but bad weather forced it to land from its target and the mission was aborted .
the pilot flew to chile , landed south of punta arenas , and dropped off the sas team .
the helicopter's crew of three then destroyed the aircraft , surrendered to chilean police on *num* may , and were repatriated to the uk after interrogation .
the discovery of the burnt-out helicopter attracted considerable international attention .
meanwhile , the sas team crossed the border and penetrated into argentina , but cancelled their mission after the argentines suspected an sas operation and deployed some troops to search for them .
the sas men were able to return to chile , and took a civilian flight back to the uk .
on *num* may the sas carried out a raid on pebble island on the falklands , where the argentine navy had taken over a grass airstrip for fma ia *num* pucará light ground-attack aircraft and beechcraft t-34 mentors , which resulted in the destruction of several aircraft .
during the night of *num* may , the british amphibious task group under the command of commodore michael clapp ( commodore , amphibious warfare – comaw ) mounted " operation sutton " , the amphibious landing on beaches around san carlos water , on the northwestern coast of east falkland facing onto falkland sound .
the bay , known as " bomb alley " by british forces , was the scene of repeated air attacks by low-flying argentine jets .
the men of *num* commando brigade were put ashore as follows : *ord* battalion , parachute regiment ( *num* para ) from the roro ferry " norland " and *num* commando royal marines from the amphibious ship were landed at san carlos ( blue beach ) , *ord* battalion , parachute regiment ( *num* para ) from the amphibious ship was landed at port san carlos ( green beach ) and *num* commando from rfa " stromness " was landed at ajax bay ( red beach ) .
notably , the waves of eight lcus and eight lcvps were led by major ewen southby-tailyour , who had commanded the falklands detachment np8901 from march *num* to *num* .
*num* commando on the ocean liner was a tactical reserve .
units from the royal artillery , royal engineers , etc .
and armoured reconnaissance vehicles were also put ashore with the landing craft , the round table class lsl and mexeflote barges .
rapier missile launchers were carried as underslung loads of sea kings for rapid deployment .
by dawn the next day , they had established a secure beachhead from which to conduct offensive operations .
from there , brigadier julian thompson's plan was to capture darwin and goose green before turning towards port stanley .
now , with the british troops on the ground , the argentine air force began the night bombing campaign against them using canberra bomber planes until the last day of the war ( *num* june ) .
at sea , the paucity of the british ships ' anti-aircraft defences was demonstrated in the sinking of on *num* may , on *num* may , and ( struck by two am39 exocets ) on *num* may along with a vital cargo of helicopters , runway-building equipment and tents .
the loss of all but one of the chinook helicopters being carried by the atlantic conveyor was a severe blow from a logistical perspective .
also lost on this day was , a sister to , whilst in company with after being ordered to act as a decoy to draw away argentine aircraft from other ships at san carlos bay .
and were badly damaged .
however , many british ships escaped being sunk because of weaknesses of the argentine pilots ' bombing tactics described below .
to avoid the highest concentration of british air defences , argentine pilots released ordnance from very low altitude , and hence their bomb fuzes did not have sufficient time to arm before impact .
the low release of the retarded bombs ( some of which the british had sold to the argentines years earlier ) meant that many never exploded , as there was insufficient time in the air for them to arm themselves .
a simple free-fall bomb in a low altitude release , impacts almost directly below the aircraft , which is then within the lethal fragmentation zone of the explosion .
a retarded bomb has a small parachute or air brake that opens to reduce the speed of the bomb to produce a safe horizontal separation between the bomb and the aircraft .
the fuze for a retarded bomb requires that the retarder be open a minimum time to ensure safe separation .
the pilots would have been aware of this—but due to the high concentration required to avoid sams , anti-aircraft artillery ( aaa ) , and british sea harriers , many failed to climb to the necessary release point .
the argentine forces solved the problem by fitting improvised retarding devices , allowing the pilots to effectively employ low-level bombing attacks on *num* june .
in his autobiographical account of the falklands war , admiral woodward blamed the bbc world service for disclosing information that led the argentines to change the retarding devices on the bombs .
the world service reported the lack of detonations after receiving a briefing on the matter from a ministry of defence official .
he describes the bbc as being more concerned with being " fearless seekers after truth " than with the lives of british servicemen .
colonel ' h ' .
jones levelled similar accusations against the bbc after they disclosed the impending british attack on goose green by *num* para .
thirteen bombs hit british ships without detonating .
lord craig , the retired marshal of the royal air force , is said to have remarked : " six better and we would have lost " although " ardent " and " antelope " were both lost despite the failure of bombs to explode .
the fuzes were functioning correctly , and the bombs were simply released from too low an altitude .
the argentines lost *num* aircraft in the attacks .
from early on *num* may until *num* may , *num* para , ( approximately *num* men ) with naval gunfire support from and artillery support from *num* commando battery , royal artillery , approached and attacked darwin and goose green , which was held by the argentine *ord* infantry regiment .
after a tough struggle that lasted all night and into the next day , the british won the battle ; in all , *num* british and *num* argentine soldiers were killed .
in total *num* argentine troops ( including *num* argentine air force personnel of the " condor " airfield ) were taken prisoner .
the bbc announced the taking of goose green on the bbc world service before it had actually happened .
it was during this attack that lieutenant colonel h .
jones , the commanding officer of *num* para , was killed at the head of his battalion while charging into the well-prepared argentine positions .
he was posthumously awarded the victoria cross .
with the sizeable argentine force at goose green out of the way , british forces were now able to break out of the san carlos beachhead .
on *num* may , men of *num* cdo and *num* para started a loaded march across east falkland towards the coastal settlement of teal inlet .
meanwhile , *num* commando prepared to move by helicopter to mount kent .
unknown to senior british officers , the argentine generals were determined to tie down the british troops in the mount kent area , and on *num* and *num* may they sent transport aircraft loaded with blowpipe surface-to-air missiles and commandos ( *ord* commando company and *ord* national gendarmerie special forces squadron ) to stanley .
this operation was known as operation " autoimpuesta " ( " self-determination initiative " ) .
for the next week , the sas and the mountain and arctic warfare cadre ( m&awc ) of *num* commando brigade waged intense patrol battles with patrols of the volunteers ' *ord* commando company under major aldo rico , normally second in command of the *ord* mountain infantry regiment .
throughout *num* may , royal air force harriers were active over mount kent .
one of them , harrier " xz963 " , flown by squadron leader jerry pook—in responding to a call for help from d squadron , attacked mount kent's eastern lower slopes , and that led to its loss through small-arms fire .
pook was subsequently awarded the distinguished flying cross .
the argentine navy used their last am39 exocet missile attempting to attack on *num* may .
there are argentine claims that the missile struck ; however , the british have denied this , some citing that shot it down .
when " invincible " returned to the uk after the war , she showed no signs of missile damage .
on *num* may , the m&awc defeated argentine special forces at the skirmish at top malo house .
a 13-strong argentine army commando detachment ( captain josé vercesi's *ord* assault section , *ord* commando company ) found itself trapped in a small shepherd's house at top malo .
the argentine commandos fired from windows and doorways and then took refuge in a stream bed from the burning house .
completely surrounded , they fought *num* m&awc marines under captain rod boswell for *num* minutes until , with their ammunition almost exhausted , they elected to surrender .
three cadre members were badly wounded .
on the argentine side , there were two dead , including lieutenant ernesto espinoza and sergeant mateo sbert ( who were posthumously decorated for their bravery ) .
only five argentines were left unscathed .
as the british mopped up top malo house , lieutenant fraser haddow's m&awc patrol came down from malo hill , brandishing a large union flag .
one wounded argentine soldier , lieutenant horacio losito , commented that their escape route would have taken them through haddow's position .
*ord* commando tried to move forward to rescue *ord* commando company on estancia mountain .
spotted by *num* commando , they were engaged with l16 81mm mortars and forced to withdraw to two sisters mountain .
the leader of *ord* commando company on estancia mountain realised his position had become untenable and after conferring with fellow officers ordered a withdrawal .
the argentine operation also saw the extensive use of helicopter support to position and extract patrols ; the *ord* combat aviation battalion also suffered casualties .
at about *num* : *num* am on *num* may , an aérospatiale sa *num* puma helicopter was brought down by a shoulder-launched fim-92 stinger surface-to-air missile ( sam ) fired by the sas in the vicinity of mount kent .
six argentine national gendarmerie special forces were killed and eight more wounded in the crash .
as brigadier thompson commented , " it was fortunate that i had ignored the views expressed by northwood hq that reconnaissance of mount kent before insertion of *num* commando was superfluous .
had d squadron not been there , the argentine special forces would have caught the commando before de-planing and , in the darkness and confusion on a strange landing zone , inflicted heavy casualties on men and helicopters .
" by *num* june , with the arrival of a further british troops of the *ord* infantry brigade , the new british divisional commander , major general jeremy moore rm , had sufficient force to start planning an offensive against stanley .
during this build-up , the argentine air assaults on the british naval forces continued , killing *num* .
of the dead , *num* were from the welsh guards on rfa " sir galahad " and rfa " sir tristram " on *num* june .
according to surgeon-commander rick jolly of the falklands field hospital , more than *num* men suffered burns and injuries of some kind in the attack , including , famously , simon weston .
the guards were sent to support an advance along the southern approach to stanley .
on *num* june , a small advance party of *num* para moved to swan inlet house in a number of army westland scout helicopters .
telephoning ahead to fitzroy , they discovered that the area was clear of argentines and ( exceeding their authority ) commandeered the one remaining raf chinook helicopter to frantically ferry another contingent of *num* para ahead to fitzroy ( a settlement on port pleasant ) and bluff cove ( a settlement on port fitzroy ) .
this uncoordinated advance caused great difficulties in planning for the commanders of the combined operation , as they now found themselves with a string of indefensible positions on their southern flank .
support could not be sent by air as the single remaining chinook was already heavily oversubscribed .
the soldiers could march , but their equipment and heavy supplies would need to be ferried by sea .
plans were drawn up for half the welsh guards to march light on the night of *num* june , whilst the scots guards and the second half of the welsh guards were to be ferried from san carlos water in the landing ship logistics ( lsl ) " sir tristram " and the landing platform dock ( lpd ) " intrepid " on the night of *num* june .
" intrepid " was planned to stay one day and unload itself and as much of " sir tristram " as possible , leaving the next evening for the relative safety of san carlos .
escorts would be provided for this day , after which " sir tristram " would be left to unload using a mexeflote ( a powered raft ) for as long as it took to finish .
political pressure from above to not risk the lpd forced commodore clapp to alter this plan .
two lower-value lsls would be sent , but with no suitable beaches to land on , " intrepid"s landing craft would need to accompany them to unload .
a complicated operation across several nights with " intrepid " and her sister ship sailing half-way to dispatch their craft was devised .
the attempted overland march by half the welsh guards failed , possibly as they refused to march light and attempted to carry their equipment .
they returned to san carlos and landed directly at bluff cove when " fearless " dispatched her landing craft .
" sir tristram " sailed on the night of *num* june and was joined by " sir galahad " at dawn on *num* june .
anchored apart in port pleasant , the landing ships were near fitzroy , the designated landing point .
the landing craft should have been able to unload the ships to that point relatively quickly , but confusion over the ordered disembarkation point ( the first half of the guards going direct to bluff cove ) resulted in the senior welsh guards infantry officer aboard insisting that his troops should be ferried the far longer distance directly to port fitzroy / bluff cove .
the alternative was for the infantrymen to march via the recently repaired bluff cove bridge ( destroyed by retreating argentine combat engineers ) to their destination , a journey of around .
on " sir galahad"s stern ramp there was an argument about what to do .
the officers on board were told that they could not sail to bluff cove that day .
they were told that they had to get their men off ship and onto the beach as soon as possible as the ships were vulnerable to enemy aircraft .
it would take *num* minutes to transport the men to shore using the lcu and mexeflote .
they would then have the choice of walking the seven miles to bluff cove or wait until dark to sail there .
the officers on board said that they would remain on board until dark and then sail .
they refused to take their men off the ship .
they possibly doubted that the bridge had been repaired due to the presence on board " sir galahad " of the royal engineer troop whose job it was to repair the bridge .
the welsh guards were keen to rejoin the rest of their battalion , who were potentially facing the enemy without their support .
they had also not seen any enemy aircraft since landing at san carlos and may have been overconfident in the air defences .
ewen southby-tailyour gave a direct order for the men to leave the ship and go to the beach , the order was ignored .
the longer journey time of the landing craft taking the troops directly to bluff cove and the squabbling over how the landing was to be performed caused an enormous delay in unloading .
this had disastrous consequences .
without escorts , having not yet established their air defence , and still almost fully laden , the two lsls in port pleasant were sitting targets for two waves of argentine a-4 skyhawks .
the disaster at port pleasant ( although often known as bluff cove ) would provide the world with some of the most sobering images of the war as tv news video footage showed navy helicopters hovering in thick smoke to winch survivors from the burning landing ships .
british casualties were *num* killed and *num* wounded .
three argentine pilots were also killed .
the air strike delayed the scheduled british ground attack on stanley by two days .
argentine general mario menéndez , commander of argentine forces in the falklands , was told that *num* british soldiers had died .
he expected that the losses would cause enemy morale to drop and the british assault to stall .
on the night of *num* june , after several days of painstaking reconnaissance and logistic build-up , british forces launched a brigade-sized night attack against the heavily defended ring of high ground surrounding stanley .
units of *num* commando brigade , supported by naval gunfire from several royal navy ships , simultaneously attacked in the battle of mount harriet , battle of two sisters , and battle of mount longdon .
mount harriet was taken at a cost of *num* british and *num* argentine soldiers .
at two sisters , the british faced both enemy resistance and friendly fire , but managed to capture their objectives .
the toughest battle was at mount longdon .
british forces were bogged down by assault rifle , mortar , machine gun , artillery fire , sniper fire , and ambushes .
despite this , the british continued their advance .
during this battle , *num* were killed when , straying too close to shore while returning from the gun line , was struck by an improvised trailer-based exocet mm38 launcher taken from the destroyer by argentine navy technicians .
on the same day , sergeant ian mckay of *num* platoon , b company , *num* para died in a grenade attack on an argentine bunker , which earned him a posthumous victoria cross .
after a night of fierce fighting , all objectives were secured .
both sides suffered heavy losses .
the second phase of attacks began on the night of *num* june , and the momentum of the initial assault was maintained .
*num* para , with light armour support from the blues and royals , captured wireless ridge , with the loss of *num* british and *num* argentine lives , and the *ord* battalion , scots guards captured mount tumbledown at the battle of mount tumbledown , which cost *num* british and *num* argentine lives .
with the last natural defence line at mount tumbledown breached , the argentine town defences of stanley began to falter .
in the morning gloom , one company commander got lost and his junior officers became despondent .
private santiago carrizo of the *ord* regiment described how a platoon commander ordered them to take up positions in the houses and " if a kelper resists , shoot him " , but the entire company did nothing of the kind .
a ceasefire was declared on *num* june and the commander of the argentine garrison in stanley , brigade general mario menéndez , surrendered to major general jeremy moore the same day .
on *num* june , the british retook the south sandwich islands , which involved accepting the surrender of the southern thule garrison at the corbeta uruguay base , and declared hostilities over .
argentina had established corbeta uruguay in *num* , but prior to *num* the united kingdom had contested the existence of the argentine base only through diplomatic channels .
in total *num* were killed during the *num* days of the conflict : of the *num* royal navy personnel , *num* were lost in , *num* + *num* lost in , *num* + *num* lost in and *num* lost in .
fourteen naval cooks were among the dead , the largest number from any one branch in the royal navy .
thirty-three of the british army's dead came from the welsh guards ( *num* of which died on the rfa " sir galahad " in the bluff cove air attacks ) , *num* from the *ord* battalion , the parachute regiment , *num* from the *ord* battalion , the parachute regiment , *num* from the special air service , *num* from royal signals and *num* from each of the scots guards and royal engineers .
the *ord* battalion / *ord* duke of edinburgh's own gurkha rifles lost one man .
two more british deaths may be attributed to operation corporate , bringing the total to *num* : there were argentine and *num* british non-fatal casualties .
further information about the field hospitals and hospital ships is at ajax bay and list of hospitals and hospital ships of the royal navy .
on the argentine side beside the military hospital at port stanley , the argentine air force mobile field hospital was deployed at comodoro rivadavia .
before british offensive operations began , the british and argentine governments agreed to establish an area on the high seas where both sides could station hospital ships without fear of attack by the other side .
this area , a circle *num* nautical miles in diameter , was referred to as the red cross box ( ) , about north of falkland sound .
ultimately , the british stationed four ships ( , and and the primary hospital ship ss " uganda " ) within the box , while the argentines stationed three ( , " bahia paraiso " and ) .
the hospital ships were non-warships converted to serve as hospital ships .
the three british naval vessels were survey vessels and " uganda " was a passenger liner .
" almirante irizar " was an icebreaker , " bahia paraiso " was an antarctic supply transport and " puerto deseado " was a survey ship .
the british and argentine vessels operating within the box were in radio contact and there was some transfer of patients between the hospital ships .
for example , the " uganda " on four occasions transferred patients to an argentine hospital ship .
the british naval hospital ships operated as casualty ferries , carrying casualties from both sides from the falklands to " uganda " and operating a shuttle service between the red cross box and montevideo .
throughout the conflict officials of the international committee of the red cross ( icrc ) conducted inspections to verify that all concerned were abiding by the rules of the geneva conventions .
on *num* june , some personnel were transferred from the argentine hospital ship to the british ships by helicopter .
argentine naval officers also inspected the british casualty ferries in the estuary of the river plate .
"hydra " worked with " hecla " and " herald " to take casualties from " uganda " to montevideo , uruguay , where a fleet of uruguayan ambulances met them .
raf vc10 aircraft then flew the casualties to the uk for transfer to the princess alexandra hospital at raf wroughton , near swindon .
this brief war brought many consequences for all the parties involved , besides the considerable casualty rate and large materiel loss , especially of shipping and aircraft , relative to the deployed military strengths of the opposing sides .
in the united kingdom , margaret thatcher's popularity increased .
the success of the falklands campaign was widely regarded as a factor in the turnaround in fortunes for the conservative government , who had been trailing behind the sdp-liberal alliance in the opinion polls for months before the conflict began , but after the success in the falklands the conservatives returned to the top of the opinion polls by a wide margin and went on to win the following year's general election by a landslide .
subsequently , defence secretary nott's proposed cuts to the royal navy were abandoned .
the islanders subsequently had full british citizenship restored in *num* , their lifestyle was improved by investments the uk made after the war and by the liberalisation of economic measures that had been stalled through fear of angering argentina .
in *num* , a new constitution was enacted promoting self-government , which has continued to devolve power to the islanders .
in argentina , defeat in the falklands war meant that a possible war with chile was avoided .
further , argentina returned to a democratic government in the *num* general election , the first free general election since *num* .
it also had a major social impact , destroying the military's image as the " moral reserve of the nation " that they had maintained through most of the *ord* century .
various figures have been produced for the number of veterans who have committed suicide since the war .
some studies have estimated that *num* british veterans and 350–500 argentine veterans have committed suicide since *num* .
however , a detailed study of british veterans of the war commissioned by the uk ministry of defence found that only *num* had died from " intentional self-harm and events of undetermined intent ( suicides and open verdict deaths ) " , a proportion lower than would be expected within the general population over the same period .
militarily , the falklands conflict remains the largest air-naval combat operation between modern forces since the end of the second world war .
as such , it has been the subject of intense study by military analysts and historians .
the most significant " lessons learned " include : the vulnerability of surface ships to anti-ship missiles and submarines , the challenges of co-ordinating logistical support for a long-distance projection of power , and reconfirmation of the role of tactical air power , including the use of helicopters .
in *num* , the bbc broadcast the " horizon " programme , " in the wake of hms sheffield " , which discussed lessons learned from the conflict , and measures since taken to implement them , such as stealth ships and close-in weapon systems .
there are several memorials on the falkland islands themselves , the most notable of which is the *num* liberation memorial , unveiled in *num* on the second anniversary of the end of the war .
it lists the names of the *num* british military personnel who died during the war and is located in front of the secretariat building in stanley , overlooking stanley harbour .
the memorial was funded entirely by the islanders and is inscribed with the words " in memory of those who liberated us " .
in addition to memorials on the islands , there is a memorial in the crypt of st paul's cathedral , london to the british war dead .
the falkland islands memorial chapel at pangbourne college was opened in march *num* as a commemoration of the lives and sacrifice of all those who served and died in the south atlantic in *num* .
in argentina , there is a memorial at plaza san martín in buenos aires , in rosario , and in ushuaia .
during the war , british dead were put into plastic body bags and buried in mass graves .
after the war , the bodies were recovered ; *num* were reburied at blue beach military cemetery and *num* were returned to the uk .
many of the argentine dead are buried in the argentine military cemetery west of the darwin settlement .
the government of argentina declined an offer by the uk to have the bodies repatriated to the mainland .
, there were *num* uncleared minefields on the falkland islands and unexploded ordnance ( uxos ) covering an area of .
of this area , on the murrell peninsula were classified as being " suspected minefields"—the area had been heavily pastured for the previous *num* years without incident .
it was estimated that these minefields had anti-personnel mines and anti-tank mines .
no human casualties from mines or uxo have been reported in the falkland islands since *num* , and no civilian mine casualties have ever occurred on the islands .
the uk reported six military personnel were injured in *num* and a further two injured in *num* .
most military accidents took place while clearing the minefields in the immediate aftermath of the *num* conflict or in the process of trying to establish the extent of the minefield perimeters , particularly where no detailed records existed .
on *num* may *num* , the falkland islands government asserted that the minefields , which represent *num* .
*num* % of the available farmland on the islands " present no long term social or economic difficulties for the falklands , " and that the impact of clearing the mines would cause more problems than containing them .
however , the british government , in accordance with its commitments under the mine ban treaty has a commitment to clear the mines by the end of *num* .
in may *num* , it was announced that of stanley common ( which lies between the stanley – mount pleasant road and the shoreline ) was made safe and had been opened to the public , opening up a stretch of coastline and a further two kilometres of shoreline along mullet's creek .
selected war correspondents were regularly flown to port stanley in military aircraft to report on the war .
back in buenos aires , newspapers and magazines faithfully reported on " the heroic actions of the largely conscript army and its successes " .
officers from the intelligence services were attached to the newspapers and ' leaked ' information confirming the official communiqués from the government .
the glossy magazines " gente " and " siete días " swelled to *num* pages with colour photographs of british warships in flames—many of them faked—and bogus eyewitness reports of the argentine commandos ' guerrilla war on south georgia ( *num* may ) and an already dead pucará pilot's attack on hms " hermes " ( lt .
daniel antonio jukic had been killed at goose green during a british air strike on *num* may ) .
most of the faked photos actually came from the tabloid press .
one of the best remembered headlines was " estamos ganando " ( " we're winning " ) from the magazine " gente " , that would later use variations of it .
the argentine troops on the falkland islands could read " gaceta argentina"—a newspaper intended to boost morale among the servicemen .
some of its untruths could easily be unveiled by the soldiers who recovered corpses .
the " malvinas cause " united the argentines in a patriotic atmosphere that protected the junta from critics , and even opponents of the military government supported galtieri ; ernesto sabato said : " don't be mistaken , europe ; it is not a dictatorship who is fighting for the malvinas , it is the whole nation .
opponents of the military dictatorship , like me , are fighting to extirpate the last trace of colonialism .
" the " madres de plaza de mayo " were even exposed to death threats from ordinary people .
hms " invincible " was repeatedly sunk in the argentine press , and on *num* april *num* the argentine magazine " tal cual " showed prime minister thatcher with an eyepatch and the text : " pirate , witch and assassin .
guilty ! " three british reporters sent to argentina to cover the war from the argentine perspective were jailed until the end of the war .
seventeen newspaper reporters , two photographers , two radio reporters and three television reporters with five technicians sailed with the task force to the war .
the newspaper publishers ' association selected them from among *num* applicants , excluding foreign media .
the hasty selection resulted in the inclusion of two journalists among the war reporters who were interested only in queen elizabeth ii's son prince andrew , who was serving in the conflict .
the prince flew a helicopter on multiple missions , including anti-surface warfare , exocet missile decoy and casualty evacuation .
merchant vessels had the civilian inmarsat uplink , which enabled written telex and voice report transmissions via satellite .
had a facsimile machine that was used to upload *num* pictures from the south atlantic over the course of the war .
the royal navy leased bandwidth on the u .
s .
defense satellite communications system for worldwide communications .
television demands a thousand times the data rate of telephone , but the ministry of defence was unsuccessful in convincing the u .
s .
to allocate more bandwidth .
tv producers suspected that the enquiry was half-hearted ; since the vietnam war television pictures of casualties and traumatised soldiers were recognised as having negative propaganda value .
however , the technology only allowed uploading a single frame per *num* minutes—and only if the military satellites were allocated *num* % to television transmissions .
videotapes were shipped to ascension island , where a broadband satellite uplink was available , resulting in tv coverage being delayed by three weeks .
the press was very dependent on the royal navy , and was censored on site .
many reporters in the uk knew more about the war than those with the task force .
the royal navy expected fleet street to conduct a second world war-style positive news campaign but the majority of the british media , especially the bbc , reported the war in a neutral fashion .
these reporters referred to " the british troops " and " the argentinian troops " instead of " our lads " and the " argies " .
the two main tabloid papers presented opposing viewpoints : " the daily mirror " was decidedly anti-war , whilst " the sun " became well known for headlines such as " stick it up your junta ! , " which , along with the reporting in other tabloids , led to accusations of xenophobia and jingoism .
there were wide-ranging influences on popular culture in both the uk and argentina , from the immediate postwar period to the present .
the argentine writer jorge luis borges described the war as " a fight between two bald men over a comb " .
the words " yomp " and " exocet " entered the british vernacular as a result of the war .
the falklands war also provided material for theatre , film and tv drama and influenced the output of musicians .
in argentina , the military government banned the broadcasting of music in the english language , giving way to the rise of local rock musicians .
balsall heath balsall heath is a working class , inner-city area of birmingham , west midlands , england .
it has a diverse cultural mix of people and is the location of the balti triangle .
balsall heath was agricultural land between moseley village and the city of birmingham until the 1850s when expansion along moseley road joined the two .
the area was originally part of the worcestershire parish of king's norton , and was added to the county borough of birmingham in warwickshire on *num* october *num* .
during negotiations in the previous year it had been promised a public baths and a free library .
in *num* , the library was opened on moseley road and , in *num* , balsall heath baths were opened in an adjoining building .
in *num* , the city's college of art was also opened on moseley road .
by this time the small lake ( " lady pool " on old maps ) at the end of ladypool road had been filled in to create a park .
balsall heath initially had a reasonably affluent population , which can still be seen in the dilapidated grandeur of some of the larger houses .
a railway station on brighton road ( on the birmingham to bristol line ) led to further expansion , and the end of the *ord* century saw a proliferation of high-density small terraced houses .
a muslim community was started in june *num* when two yemenis purchased an artisan cottage on mary street .
with the mosque being located in the area , more muslim immigrants began to move into private lodgings in balsall heath .
today , balsall heath has one of the largest muslim communities in birmingham .
it is also home to diverse communities from across the commonwealth .
by the 1980s , many of balsall heath's houses were in a dilapidated condition ; some still lacked bathrooms or indoor toilets .
the local council considered demolishing these properties but chose to refurbish them as part of an urban renewal scheme .
most of these victorian terraces still exist and , along with more modern social housing , characterise the area today .
the area's traditional ' brick ' pavements were replaced at this time by the more modern and conventional paving slabs .
balsall heath's low rents also attracted a bohemian student population .
its proximity to the university of birmingham , the city centre and the " trendy " area of moseley were all contributing factors .
there was little conflict between the students and locals despite their vastly differing lifestyles .
however , a knife-incident in *num* led to an article in " redbrick " warning students not to live in the area .
in july *num* , balsall heath was hit by a tornado , which devastated many buildings around church road and ladypool road .
birmingham city council offered loans to those who would otherwise be unable to repair their properties , and the area has now made a full recovery .
street prostitution first appeared in balsall heath during the 1950s .
property values fell , attracting birmingham's poorer migrants .
by the 1970s , the area was notorious for street robberies and drug dealing .
cheddar road was the centre of a red-light district worked by *num* women .
about half of the *num* houses on this road had prostitutes advertising themselves in the windows , similar to amsterdam .
it was labelled britain's busiest cul-de-sac .
in *num* , an organisation called anawim was formed by the sisters of charity to provide outreach support to the prostitutes .
in september *num* , a report was published encouraging the formation of a zone of tolerance towards prostitution in balsall heath .
this was opposed by residents and a local police inspector .
in the following year samo paull , a woman working as a prostitute , was abducted from balsall heath and murdered .
in *num* , residents began to organise street patrols forcing the prostitutes and street criminals out of the area .
these patrols had the qualified support of the police but were regarded as vigilantes by some .
there was an immediate two-thirds reduction in street and window prostitution .
by november *num* , they had been almost completely eliminated .
the area has enjoyed a slow revival .

firmin abauzit firmin abauzit ( november *num* , 1679march *num* , *num* ) was a french scholar who worked on physics , theology and philosophy , and served as librarian in geneva ( republic of geneva ) during his final *num* years .
abauzit is also notable for proofreading or correcting the writings of isaac newton and other scholars .
firmin abauzit was born of huguenot parents november *num* , *num* at uzès , in languedoc .
his paternal family traces its origin to an arab physician who settled in toulouse during the *ord* century .
accordingly , the name “abauzit” is liked derived from the arabic “abu zaid” ( father of zaid ) .
his father died when he was but two years of age ; and when , on the revocation of the edict of nantes in *num* , the authorities took steps to have him educated in the roman catholic faith , his mother contrived his escape .
for two years his brother and he lived as fugitives in the mountains of the cévennes , but they at last reached geneva , where their mother afterwards joined them on escaping from the imprisonment in which she was held from the time of their flight .
abauzit at an early age acquired great proficiency in languages , physics , and theology .
in *num* , he traveled to germany , then to holland , where he became acquainted with pierre bayle , pierre jurieu and jacques basnage .
proceeding to england , he was introduced to sir isaac newton , who found in him one of the earliest defenders , against castel of his discoveries .
newton corrected in the second edition of his " principia " an error pointed out by abauzit , and , when sending him the " commercium epistolicum , " said , " you are well worthy to judge between gottfried leibniz and me .
" the reputation of abauzit induced william iii to request him to settle in england , but he did not accept the king's offer , preferring to return to geneva .
there , from *num* he rendered valuable assistance to a society that had been formed for translating the new testament into french .
he declined the offer of the chair of philosophy at the university of geneva in *num* .
he assisted in the french language new testament in *num* .
in *num* , he was granted citizenship in geneva , and he accepted the office of honorary librarian to geneva , the city of his adoption .
it was while he was in geneva in his later years that he authored many of his works .
here also was the city of his death past the age of *num* , on march *num* , *num* .
abauzit was a man of great learning and of wonderful versatility .
whatever chanced to be discussed , it used to be said of abauzit that he seemed to have made it a subject of particular study .
rousseau , who was jealously sparing of his praises , addressed to him , in his " julie , ou la nouvelle héloïse " , a fine panegyric ; and when a stranger flatteringly told voltaire he had come to see a great man , the philosopher asked him if he had seen abauzit .
among his acquaintances , abauzit claimed rousseau , voltaire , newton , and bayle .
little remains of the labours of this intellectual giant , his heirs having , it is said , destroyed the papers that came into their possession , because their own religious opinions were different .
a few theological , archaeological , and astronomical articles from his pen appeared in the " journal helvétique " and elsewhere , and he contributed several papers to rousseau's " dictionnaire de musique " ( *num* ) .
he wrote a work throwing doubt on the canonical authority of the apocalypse , which called forth a reply from dr leonard twells , and was published in denis diderot's " encyclopédie " .
he also edited and made valuable additions to jacob spon's " histoire de la république de genève " .
a collection of his writings was published at geneva in *num* ( " œuvres de feu m .
abauzit " ) , and another at london in *num* ( " œuvres diverses de m .
abauzit " ) .
duke kahanamoku duke paoa kahinu mokoe hulikohola kahanamoku ( august *num* , *num* – january *num* , *num* ) was a native hawaiian competition swimmer who popularized the ancient hawaiian sport of surfing .
he was born towards the end of the kingdom of hawaii , just before the overthrow , living into statehood as a united states citizen .
he was a five-time olympic medalist in swimming .
duke was also a scottish rite freemason , a law enforcement officer , an actor , a beach volleyball player and businessman .
according to kahanamoku , he was born in honolulu at haleʻākala , the home of bernice pauahi bishop which was later converted into the arlington hotel .
he had five brothers and three sisters , including samuel kahanamoku and sargent kahanamoku .
in *num* , the family moved to kālia , waikiki ( near the present site of the hilton hawaiian village ) , to be closer to his mother's parents and family .
duke grew up with his siblings and *num* paoa cousins .
duke attended the waikiki grammar school , kaahumanu school , and the kamehameha schools , although he never graduated because he had to quit to help support the family .
"duke " was not a title or a nickname , but a given name .
he was named after his father , duke halapu kahanamoku , who was christened by bernice pauahi bishop in honor of prince alfred , duke of edinburgh , who was visiting hawaii at the time .
his father was a policeman .
his mother julia paakonia lonokahikina paoa was a deeply religious woman with a strong sense of family ancestry .
even though not of the formal hawaiian royal family , his parents were from prominent hawaiian ohana ( family ) ; the kahanamoku and the paoa ohana were considered to be lower-ranking nobles , who were in service to the " aliʻi nui " or royalty .
his paternal grandfather was kahanamoku and his grandmother , kapiolani kaoeha ( sometimes spelled " kahoea " ) , a descendant of alapainui .
they were " kahu " , retainers and trusted advisors of the kamehamehas , to whom they were related .
his maternal grandparents paoa , son of paoa hoolae and hiikaalani , and mele uliama were also of aliʻi descent .
growing up on the outskirts of waikiki , kahanamoku spent his youth as a bronzed beach boy .
at waikiki beach he developed his surfing and swimming skills .
in his youth , kahanamoku preferred a traditional surf board , which he called his " papa nui " , constructed after the fashion of ancient hawaiian " olo " boards .
made from the wood of a koa tree , it was long and weighed .
the board was without a skeg , which had yet to be invented .
in his later career , he would often use smaller boards but always preferred those made of wood .
on august *num* , *num* , kahanamoku was timed at *num* .
*num* seconds in the freestyle , beating the existing world record by *num* .
*num* seconds , in the salt water of honolulu harbor .
he also broke the record in the and equaled it in the .
but the amateur athletic union ( aau ) , in disbelief , would not recognize these feats until many years later .
the aau initially claimed that the judges must have been using alarm clocks rather than stopwatches and later claimed that ocean currents aided kahanamoku .
he was initiated to the hawaiian masonic lodge no *num* kahanamoku easily qualified for the u .
s .
olympic swimming team in *num* .
at the *num* summer olympics in stockholm , he won a gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle , and a silver medal with the second-place u .
s .
team in the men's 4×200-meter freestyle relay .
during the *num* olympics in antwerp , he won gold medals both in the *num* meters ( bettering fellow hawaiian pua kealoha ) and in the relay .
he finished the *num* meters with a silver medal during the *num* olympics in paris , with the gold going to johnny weissmuller and the bronze to duke's brother , samuel kahanamoku .
at age *num* , this was kahanamoku's last olympic medal .
he also was an alternate for the u .
s .
water polo team at the *num* summer olympics .
between olympic competitions , and after retiring from the olympics , kahanamoku traveled internationally to give swimming exhibitions .
it was during this period that he popularized the sport of surfing , previously known only in hawaii , by incorporating surfing exhibitions into these visits as well .
his surfing exhibition at sydney's freshwater beach on december *num* , *num* is widely regarded as a seminal event in the development of surfing in australia .
the board that kahanamoku built from a piece of pine from a local hardware store is retained by the freshwater surf club .
there is a statue of kahanamoku on the northern headland of freshwater beach , new south wales .
he made surfing popular in mainland america first in *num* while in southern california .
during his time living in southern california , kahanamoku performed in hollywood as a background actor and a character actor in several films .
in this way , he made connections with people who could further publicize the sport of surfing .
kahanamoku was involved with the los angeles athletic club , acting as lifeguard and competing on both swimming and water polo teams .
while living in newport beach , california on june *num* , *num* , kahanamoku rescued eight men from a fishing vessel that capsized in heavy surf while attempting to enter the city's harbor .
*num* fishermen went into the water and *num* perished .
using his surfboard , he was able to make quick trips back and forth to shore to increase the number of sailors rescued .
two other surfers saved four more fishermen .
newport's police chief at the time called duke's efforts " the most superhuman surfboard rescue act the world has ever seen " .
it also caused u .
s .
lifeguards to begin using surfboards in their water rescues .
in *num* , he married nadine alexander , who accompanied him when he traveled .
kahanamoku was the first person to be inducted into both the swimming hall of fame and the surfing hall of fame .
the duke kahanamoku invitational surfing championships are named in his honor .
he is a member of the u .
s .
olympic hall of fame .
he served as sheriff of honolulu , hawaii from *num* to *num* , serving *num* consecutive terms .
during this period , he also appeared in a number of television programs and films , such as " mister roberts " ( *num* ) .
kahanamoku was a friend and surfing companion of heiress doris duke , who built a home ( now a museum ) on oahu named shangri-la .
in *num* , kahanamoku was the " pro forma " defendant in the landmark supreme court case " duncan v .
kahanamoku " .
while kahanamoku was a military police officer during world war ii , he arrested duncan , a civilian shipfitter , for public intoxication .
at the time , hawaii , not yet a state , was being administered under the hawaiian organic act which effectively instituted martial law on the island .
duncan was therefore tried by a military tribunal and appealed to the supreme court .
in a " post hoc " ruling , the court ruled that trial by military tribunal was , in this case , unconstitutional .
kahanamoku died of a heart attack on january *num* , *num* , at the age of *num* .
for his burial at sea a long motorcade of mourners , accompanied by a 30-man police escort , moved across town to waikiki beach .
reverend abraham akaka , the pastor of kawaiahao church , performed the service , a group of beach boys sang hawaiian songs , including " aloha oe " , and his ashes were scattered into the ocean .
the city of honolulu commemorated this waikiki beach burial site in *num* with a 9-foot cast bronze statue of kahanamoku by jan gordon fisher that shows kahanamoku with outstretched arms in front of his surfboard and flanked by honorary hawaiian spears , surrounded by a dedication plaque and historic information marker .
the statue's orientation that placed kahanamoku's back to the sea was initially criticized as being contrary to hawaiian custom .
public art in public places claims , however , that its orientation toward the pedestrian activity and public realm on kalakaua avenue has created a highly popular local shrine and tourist locale ; the statue's outstretched arms are always adorned with fresh leis and the locale receives annual tribute ceremonies and thousands of yearly tourist visits .
in *num* , the historic public artwork " the stones of life " , containing four ancient basaltic stones or pōhaku ( circa *num* ) , was installed nearby .
on february *num* , *num* , a monument featuring a replica of kahanamoku's surfboard was unveiled at new brighton beach , christchurch , new zealand in honour of the *ord* anniversary of kahanamoku's visit to new brighton .
hawaii music promoter kimo wilder mcvay capitalized on kahanamoku's popularity by naming his waikiki showroom " duke kahanamoku's , " and giving kahanamoku a financial interest in the showroom in exchange for the use of his name .
it was a major waikiki showroom in the 1960s and is remembered as the home of don ho & the aliis from *num* through *num* .
the showroom continued to be known as duke kahanamoku's until hawaii showman jack cione bought it in the mid-1970s and renamed it le boom boom .
kahanamoku's name is also used by duke's canoe club & barefoot bar , known as duke's waikiki , a beachfront bar and restaurant in the outrigger waikiki on the beach hotel .
there is a chain of restaurants named after him in california , florida and hawaii called duke's .
on august *num* , *num* , the *ord* anniversary of kahanamoku's birth , the u .
s .
postal service issued a first-class commemorative stamp with duke's picture on it .
the first day ceremony was held at the hilton hawaiian village in waikiki and was attended by thousands .
at this ceremony , attendees could attach the duke stamp to an envelope and get it canceled with a first day of issue postmark .
these first day covers are very collectible .
on august *num* , *num* , a google doodle honored the *ord* anniversary of duke kahanamoku's birthday .
list of islands of greece greece has a large number of islands , with estimates ranging from somewhere around *num* , *num* to *num* , *num* , depending on the minimum size to take into account .
the number of inhabited islands is variously cited as between *num* and *num* .
the largest greek island by area is crete , located at the southern edge of the aegean sea .
the second largest island is euboea , which is separated from the mainland by the 60m-wide euripus strait , and is administered as part of the central greece region .
after the third and fourth largest greek islands , lesbos and rhodes , the rest of the islands are two-thirds of the area of rhodes , or smaller .
the greek islands are traditionally grouped into the following clusters : the argo-saronic islands in the saronic gulf near athens ; the cyclades , a large but dense collection occupying the central part of the aegean sea ; the north aegean islands , a loose grouping off the west coast of turkey ; the dodecanese , another loose collection in the southeast between crete and turkey ; the sporades , a small tight group off the coast of euboea ; and the ionian islands , chiefly located to the west of the mainland in the ionian sea .
crete with its surrounding islets and euboea are traditionally excluded from this grouping .
the following are the largest greek islands listed by surface area .
the table includes all islands of over .

do not adjust your set do not adjust your set ( dnays ) was a television series produced originally by rediffusion , london , then , by the fledgling thames television for british commercial television channel itv from *num* december *num* to *num* may *num* .
the show took its name from the message ( frequently seen on the tv screen in those days ) which was displayed when there was a problem with transmission .
it included early appearances of denise coffey , david jason , eric idle , terry jones , and michael palin ; the last three became members of the monty python comedy troupe soon afterwards .
although originally conceived as a children's programme , it quickly acquired a following amongst many adults , including future pythons john cleese and graham chapman ( as mentioned by cleese himself in the " paying my ex-wife " stage performance tour , october *num* ) .
satirical comedy / art / pop group the bonzo dog doo-dah band also performed a song or two in each programme and frequently appeared as extras in sketches .
the programme itself comprised a series of frequently satirical sketches , often presented in a bizarre , surreal and disjointed style which anticipates " monty python's flying circus " , which followed five months after the last episode of " dnays " .
strange animations between sketches were crafted for the final episodes by the then-unknown terry gilliam , who soon graduated to " python " with palin , jones and idle – part of gilliam's " christmas cards " animation reappeared there in the " joy to the world " segment .
one long-running feature of the show was " captain fantastic " , a superhero parody featuring david jason in improbable and even macabre adventures against villainess mrs .
black ( coffey ) .
these segments were shot entirely on film , on location in london .
the feature was so popular with the young audience that after dnays itself ended captain fantastic briefly continued on its own terms .
in *num* , dnays won an international award , the prix jeunesse , in munich .
nine of the *num* episodes from the first ( rediffusion ) series were released on dvd in the uk and the us in august *num* .
both releases use the same ntsc region *num* discs made from telerecordings of the original videotapes .
the episodes are renumbered *num* to *num* , although , in fact they are episodes 1-2 , 5-6 , and 9-13 ( a similar fault was made on the release of " at last the *num* show " ) .
the sole surviving episode from series *num* and " do not adjust your stocking " were not included .
the *ord* episode of the first series was only discovered afterwards - it survives because the show was entered for the prix de jeunesse award , so a copy was sent to the jury - and does not appear on the dvd either .
the packaging further implies that gilliam's animations appear in these episodes , but they do not .
gilliam does appear as one of the additional writers in the credits for episodes three and four .
the bonzo dog doo dah band is seen playing its song " death cab for cutie " ( also performed in the beatles ' film " magical mystery tour " ) in the dvd , episode *num* .

as an mp , widdecombe expressed conservative views , including opposition to abortion ; it was understood during her time in frontline politics that she would not become health secretary as long as this involved responsibility for abortions .

she notably spoke of her support for its reintroduction for the worst cases of murder in the aftermath of the murder of two 10-year-old girls from soham , cambridgeshire , in august *num* , in the soham murders .
she supported the argument that the death penalty would have deterrent value , as within five years of its abolition the national murder rate had more than doubled .
although she supported the uk's partial decriminalisation of homosexuality in *num* , widdecombe has consistently opposed lgbt rights while in parliament , saying in *num* that " i do not think that [ homosexuality ] can be promoted as an equally valid lifestyle to [ heterosexual ] marriage , but i would say the same about irregular heterosexual arrangements .
" she has consistently argued against an equal age of consent for same-sex relationships – first in *num* ( voting against the *num* act , which would have reduced the age of consent for some male-male sexual activity in the uk from *num* to *num* ) , and secondly in *num* ( arguing against a further reduction from *num* to *num* , which later occurred in *num* ) ; on the latter point , she wrote in " the mail on sunday " that " one of the sundry horrors for which this government is likely to be remembered will be that it gave its imprimatur to sodomy at *num* " , adding that if the age of consent was equalised , " there will be no protection for the vulnerable and confused against the predatory attentions of older men " .
she later said in *num* : " i do not believe that issues of equality should override the imperatives of protecting the young .

" , prior to the leadership contest , that she wished to retire to the backbenches anyway ) .
in the *num* leadership election , she initially supported kenneth clarke again .
once he was eliminated , she turned support towards liam fox .
following fox's subsequent elimination , she took time to reflect before finally declaring for david davis .
she expressed reservations over the eventual winner david cameron , feeling that he did not , like the other candidates , have a proven track record , and she was later a leading figure in parliamentary opposition to his a-list policy , which she has said is " an insult to women " .
at the october *num* conservative conference , she was chief dragon in a political version of the television programme " dragons ' den " , in which a-list candidates were invited to put forward a policy proposal , which was then torn apart by her team of rachel elnaugh , oliver letwin and michael brown .

in a *num* report in " the guardian " it was claimed that she had had a three-year romance while at the university of oxford .

in *num* , widdecombe , as prisons minister , defended the government's policy to shackle pregnant prisoners with handcuffs and chains when in hospital receiving ante-natal care .
widdecombe told the commons the restrictions were needed to prevent prisoners from escaping .
" some mps may like to think that a pregnant woman would not or could not escape .
unfortunately this is not true .
the fact is that hospitals are not secure places in which to keep prisoners , and since *num* , *num* women have escaped from hospitals " .

she wrote , " his idea of wit is a barrage of filth and the sort of humour most men grow out of in their teens .
.
.
[ t ] here's no amount of money for which i would go through those two recording hours again .
at one stage i nearly walked out .
" she did , however , stand by her appraisal of regular panellists ian hislop and paul merton , whom she has called " the fastest wits in showbusiness " .
merton later revealed that he thought widdecombe had been " the worst ever presenter " of the show , particularly on her second appearance where merton claimed she " thought she was victoria wood " .
in *num* she awarded the " university challenge " trophy to the winners .
in the same year , she was cast as herself in " the sound of drums " , the *ord* episode of the third series of the science-fiction drama " doctor who " supporting mr saxon , the alias of the master .

geography of colombia the republic of colombia is a transcontinental country largely situated in the northwest of south america , with territories in north america .
colombia is bordered to the northwest by panama ; to the east by venezuela and brazil ; to the south by ecuador and peru ; and it shares maritime limits with costa rica , nicaragua , honduras , jamaica , the dominican republic , and haiti .
colombia is the *ord* largest nation in the world and the fourth-largest country in south america after brazil , argentina , and peru .
despite its large territory , colombia's population is not evenly distributed , with most colombians living in the mountainous western portion of the country as well as the northern coastline , most living in or near the capital city of bogotá .
the southern and eastern portions of the country are mostly sparsely inhabited tropical rainforest , and inland tropical plains containing large estates or large livestock farms , oil and gas production facilities , small farming communities and indigenous tribes .
colombia usually classifies its geography into five natural regions , from the andes mountain range , a region shared with ecuador , venezuela ; the pacific ocean coastal region shared with panama and ecuador ; the caribbean sea coastal region , shared with venezuela and panama ; the " llanos " ( plains ) , shared with venezuela ; to the amazon rainforest region shared with venezuela , brazil , peru and ecuador .
colombia is the only south american country which borders both the atlantic and pacific oceans .
despite this " the world factbook " makes no difference between amazon region of colombia ( predominantly jungle ) and the orinoquia region of colombia ( predominantly plains ) .
" the world factbook " considers most appropriate to divide the country into four geographic regions : the andean highlands , consisting of the three andean ranges and intervening valley lowlands ; the caribbean lowlands coastal region ; the pacific lowlands coastal region , separated from the caribbean lowlands by swamps at the base of the isthmus of panama ; and eastern colombia , the great plain that lies to the east of the andes mountains .
the chief western mountain range , the cordillera occidental , is a moderately high range with peaks reaching up to about ( *num* , *num* m ) .
the cauca river valley , an important agricultural region with several large cities on its borders , separates the cordillera occidental from the massive cordillera central .
several snow-clad volcanoes in the cordillera central have summits that rise above .
the valley of the slow-flowing and muddy magdalena river , a major transportation artery , separates the cordillera central from the main eastern range , the cordillera oriental .
the peaks of the cordillera oriental are moderately high .
this range differs from colombia's other mountain ranges in that it contains several large basins .
in the east , the sparsely populated , flat to gently rolling eastern lowlands called " llanos " cover almost *num* percent of the country's total land area .
this cross section of the republic does not include two of colombia's regions : the caribbean coastal lowlands and the sierra nevada de santa marta , both in the northern part of the country .
the lowlands in the west are mostly swampy ; the reed-filled marshes of the area are called " ciénagas " by the people of colombia .
the guajira peninsula in the east is semiarid .
the sierra nevada de santa marta is a spectacular triangular snowcapped block of rock that towers over the eastern part of this lowland .
here can be found the highest peak of the country named pico cristobal colon ( *num* m ) .
near the ecuadorian frontier , the andes mountains divide into three distinct , roughly parallel chains , called cordilleras , that extend northeastward almost to the caribbean sea .
altitudes reach more than , and mountain peaks are permanently covered with snow .
the elevated basins and plateaus of these ranges have a moderate climate that provides pleasant living conditions and in many places enables farmers to harvest twice a year .
torrential rivers on the slopes of the mountains produce a large hydroelectric power potential and add their volume to the navigable rivers in the valleys .
in the late 1980s , approximately *num* percent of the country's population lived in the andean highlands .
the cordillera occidental in the west , the cordillera central in the center , and the cordillera oriental in the east have different characteristics .
geologically , the cordillera occidental and the cordillera central form the western and eastern sides of a massive crystalline arch that extends from the caribbean lowlands to the southern border of ecuador .
the cordillera oriental , however , is composed of folded stratified rocks overlying a crystalline core .
the cordillera occidental is relatively low and is the least populated of the three cordilleras .
summits are only about above sea level and do not have permanent snows .
few passes exist , although one that is about above sea level provides the major city of cali with an outlet to the pacific ocean .
the relatively low elevation of the cordillera permits dense vegetation , which on the western slopes is truly tropical .
the cordillera occidental is separated from the cordillera central by the deep rift of the cauca valley .
the río cauca rises within of the border with ecuador and flows through some of the best farmland in the country .
after the two cordilleras converge , the cauca valley becomes a deep gorge all the way to the caribbean lowlands .
the cordillera central is the loftiest of the mountain systems .
its crystalline rocks form a towering wall dotted with snow-covered volcanoes that is long .
there are no plateaus in this range and no passes under .
the highest peak in this range , the nevado del huila , reaches above sea level .
the second highest peak is a volcano , nevado del ruiz , which erupted violently on november *num* , *num* .
toward its northern end , this cordillera separates into several branches that descend toward the caribbean coast .
between the cordillera central and the cordillera oriental flows the magdalena river .
this -long river rises near a point some north of the border with ecuador , where the cordillera oriental and the cordillera central diverge .
its spacious drainage area is fed by numerous mountain torrents originating high in the snowfields .
the magdalena river is generally navigable from the caribbean sea as far as the town of neiva , deep in the interior , but is interrupted midway by rapids .
the valley floor is very deep ; nearly from the river's mouth the elevation is no more than about .
in the cordillera oriental at elevations between , three large fertile basins and a number of small ones provide suitable areas for settlement and intensive economic production .
in the basin of cundinamarca , where the spanish found the chibcha indians , the european invaders established the town of santa fe de bogotá ( present-day bogotá ) at an elevation of above sea level .
to the north of bogotá , in the densely populated basins of chiquinquirá and boyacá , are fertile fields , rich mines , and large industrial establishments that produce much of the national wealth .
still farther north , where the cordillera oriental makes an abrupt turn to the northwest near the border with venezuela , the highest point of this range , the sierra nevada de cocuy , rises to above sea level .
in the department of santander , the valleys on the western slopes are more spacious , and agriculture is intensive in the area around bucaramanga .
the northernmost region of the range around cúcuta is so rugged that historically it has been easier to maintain communications and transportation with venezuela than with the adjacent parts of colombia .
the caribbean lowlands consist of all of colombia north of an imaginary line extending northeastward from the golfo de urabá to the venezuelan frontier at the northern extremity of the cordillera oriental .
the semiarid guajira peninsula and guajira-barranquilla xeric scrub , in the extreme north , bear little resemblance to the rest of the region .
in the southern part rises the sierra nevada de santa marta , an isolated mountain system with peaks reaching heights over and slopes generally too steep for cultivation .
the caribbean lowlands region is in roughly the shape of a triangle , the longest side of which is the coastline .
most of the country's commerce moves through cartagena , barranquilla , santa marta , and the other ports located along this important coast .
inland from these cities are swamps , hidden streams , and shallow lakes that support banana and cotton plantations , countless small farms , and , in higher places , cattle ranches .
the city of cartagena is a petrochemical , seaport ( #1 in the country ) and tourist city ( #1 in the country ) .
santa marta is also a seaport and tourist city but is a smaller-scale city by comparison .
barranquilla is located some from the caribbean coastline but it is a more developed city with a greater number of industries and commercial places , widely known for its abilities in all forms of metalwork and construction .
its inhabitants have the highest education level of the region and the city is famous for being the starting point and focus of the region and the country's development as the first city in the country with the use of phones , public lighting , air mail , planes and industrial works .
the caribbean region merges next to and is connected with the andean highlands through the two great river valleys .
after the andean highlands , it is the second most important region in economic activity .
approximately *num* % of the country's population lived in this region in the late 1980s .
the region also includes the peninsular archipelago of san andres island and the insular territories of colombia , which are disputed in part by nicaragua .
however , the colombian navy protects such territories with the use of force when necessary to avoid foreign invasion and the islands are home to *num* important bases for defense and custom controls , formerly used for research of classified projects with civilian assistance as the local universities often research in the area of oceanography and marine biology but also in the fields of biochemistry , genetics , immunology and colombia is known for its advances in medical fields in experimental surgery , breast implant development or prosthetics and immunology and these facilities serve as containment and secure experimentation labs to complement those in barranquilla and other undisclosed locations within the coast territories .
the insular region is considered by some as a geopolitical region of colombia which comprises the areas outside the continental territories of colombia and includes the san andrés y providencia department in the caribbean sea and the malpelo and gorgona islands in the pacific ocean .
the insular region subregions include other group of islands ; the western third of the country is the most geographically complex .
starting at the shore of the pacific ocean in the west and moving eastward at a latitude of *num* degrees north , a diverse sequence of features is encountered .
in the extreme west are the very narrow and discontinuous pacific coastal lowlands , which are backed by the serranía de baudó , the lowest and narrowest of colombia's mountain ranges .
next is the broad region of the río atrato / río san juan lowland , which has been proposed as a possible alternate to the panama canal as a human-made route between the atlantic and the pacific oceans .
colombia occupies most of the andes mountain range northern extremity sharing a bit with venezuela which splits into three branches between the colombia-ecuador border .
in the 1980s , only *num* % of all colombians resided in the pacific lowlands , a region of jungle and swamp with considerable but little-exploited potential in minerals and other resources .
buenaventura is the only port of any size on the coast .
on the east , the pacific lowlands are bounded by the cordillera occidental , from which numerous streams run .
most of the streams flow westward to the pacific , but the largest , the navigable río atrato , flows northward to the golfo de urabá , making the river settlements accessible to the major atlantic ports and commercially related primarily to the caribbean lowlands hinterland .
to the west of the río atrato rises the serranía de baudó , an isolated chain of low mountains that occupies a large part of the region .
its highest elevation is less than *num* , *num* meters , and its vegetation resembles that of the surrounding tropical forest .
the atrato swamp—in chocó department adjoining the border with panama—is a deep muck sixty-five kilometers in width that for years has challenged engineers seeking to complete the pan-american highway .
this stretch , near turbo , where the highway is interrupted is known as the tapón del chocó ( chocon plug ) .
a second major transportation project involving chocó department has been proposed .
a second interoceanic canal would be constructed by dredging the río atrato and other streams and digging short access canals .
completion of either of these projects would do much to transform this region , although it could have devastating consequences on the fragile environment .
the area east of the andes includes about *num* , *num* square kilometers or three-fifths of the country's total area , but colombians view it almost as an alien land .
the entire area , known as the eastern plains , was home to only *num* % of the country's population in the late 1980s .
the spanish term for plains ( " llanos " ) can be applied only to the open plains in the northern part , particularly the piedmont areas near the cordillera oriental , where extensive cattle raising is practiced .
the region is unbroken by highlands except in meta department , where the serranía de la macarena , an outlier of the andes has unique vegetation and wildlife believed to be reminiscent of those that once existed throughout the andes .
many of the numerous large rivers of eastern colombia are navigable .
the río guaviare and the streams to its north flow eastward and drain into the basin of the río orinoco , a river that crosses into venezuela and flows into the atlantic ocean .
those south of the río guaviare flows into the amazon basin .
the río guaviare divides eastern colombia into the llanos subregion in the north and the tropical rainforest , or selva , subregion in the south .
the striking variety in temperature and precipitation results principally from differences in elevation .
temperatures range from very hot at sea level to relatively cold at higher elevations but vary little with the season .
at bogotá , for example , the average annual temperature is , and the difference between the average of the coldest and the warmest months is less than *num* °c ( *num* .
*num* °f ) .
more significant , however , is the daily variation in temperature , from at night to during the day .
colombians customarily describe their country in terms of the climatic zones : the area under in elevation is called the hot zone ( tierra caliente ) , elevations between are the temperate zone ( tierra templada ) , and elevations from to about constitute the cold zone ( tierra fría ) .
the upper limit of the cold zone marks the tree line and the approximate limit of human habitation .
the treeless regions adjacent to the cold zone and extending to approximately are high , bleak areas ( usually referred to as the páramos ) , above which begins the area of permanent snow ( nevado ) .
about *num* % of the country's total area lies in the hot zone .
included in the hot zone and interrupting the temperate area of the andean highlands are the long and narrow extension of the magdalena valley and a small extension in the cauca valley .
temperatures , depending on elevation , vary between , and there are alternating dry and wet seasons corresponding to summer and winter , respectively .
breezes on the caribbean coast , however , reduce both heat and precipitation .
rainfall in the hot zone is heaviest in the pacific lowlands and in parts of eastern colombia , where rain is almost a daily occurrence and rain forests predominate .
precipitation exceeds annually in most of the pacific lowlands , making this one of the wettest regions in the world .
the highest average annual precipitation in the world is estimated to be in lloro , colombia , with .
in eastern colombia , it decreases from in portions of the andean piedmont to eastward .
extensive areas of the caribbean interior are permanently flooded , more because of poor drainage than because of the moderately heavy precipitation during the rainy season from may through october .
the temperate zone covers about *num* % of the country .
this zone includes the lower slopes of the cordillera oriental and the cordillera central and most of the intermontane valleys .
the important cities of medellín ( ) and cali ( ) are located in this zone , where rainfall is moderate and the mean annual temperature varies between , depending on the elevation .
in the higher elevations of this zone , farmers benefit from two wet and two dry seasons each year ; january through march and july through september are the dry seasons .
the cold or cool zone constitutes about *num* % of the total area , including some of the most densely populated plateaus and terraces of the colombian andes ; this zone supports about onefourth of the country's total population .
the mean temperature ranges between , and the wet seasons occur in april and may and from september to december , as in the high elevations of the temperate zone .
precipitation is moderate to heavy in most parts of the country ; the heavier rainfall occurs in the low-lying hot zone .
considerable variations occur because of local conditions that affect wind currents , however , and areas on the leeward side of the guajira peninsula receive generally light rainfall ; the annual rainfall of recorded at the uribia station there is the lowest in colombia .
considerable year-to-year variations have been recorded , and colombia sometimes experiences droughts .
colombia's geographic and climatic variations have combined to produce relatively well-defined " ethnocultural " groups among different regions of the country : the costeño from the caribbean coast ; the caucano in the cauca region and the pacific coast ; the antioqueño in antioquia , caldas , risaralda , and valle del cauca departments ; the tolimense in tolima and huila departments ; the cundiboyacense in the interior departments of cundinamarca and boyacá in the cordillera oriental ; the santandereano in norte de santander and santander departments ; and the llanero in the eastern plains .
each group has distinctive characteristics , accents , customs , social patterns , and forms of cultural adaptation to climate and topography that differentiates it from other groups .
even with rapid urbanization and modernization , regionalism and regional identification continued to be important reference points , although they were somewhat less prominent in the 1980s than in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries .
colombia's proximity to the equator influences its climates .
the lowland areas are continuously hot .
altitude affects temperature greatly .
temperatures decrease about for every increase in altitude above sea level .
rainfall varies by location in colombia , tending to increase as one travels southward .
this is especially true in the eastern lowlands .
for example , rainfall in parts of the guajira peninsula seldom exceeds per year .
colombia's rainy southeast , however , is often drenched by more than of rain per year .
rainfall in most of the rest of the country runs between these two extremes .
altitude affects not only temperature , but also vegetation .
in fact , altitude is one of the most important influences on vegetation patterns in colombia .
the mountainous parts of the country can be divided into several vegetation zones according to altitude , although the altitude limits of each zone may vary somewhat depending on the latitude .
the " tierra caliente " ( hot land ) , below , is the zone of tropical crops such as bananas .
the tierra templada ( temperate land ) , extending from an altitude of , is the zone of coffee and maize .
wheat and potatoes dominate in the " tierra fría " ( cold land ) , at altitudes from .
in the " zona forestada " ( forested zone ) , which is located between , many of the trees have been cut for firewood .
treeless pastures dominate the páramos , or alpine grasslands , at altitudes of .
above , where temperatures are below freezing , is the " tierra helada " , a zone of permanent snow and ice .
vegetation also responds to rainfall patterns .
a scrub woodland of scattered trees and bushes dominates the semiarid northeast .
to the south , savannah ( tropical grassland ) vegetation covers the colombian portion of the llanos .
the rainy areas in the southeast are blanketed by tropical rainforest .
in the mountains , the spotty patterns of precipitation in alpine areas complicate vegetation patterns .
the rainy side of a mountain may be lush and green , while the other side , in the rain shadow , may be parched .
the andean range is located in colombia from the southwest ( ecuador border ) toward the northeast ( venezuela border ) and is divided in the colombian massif ( " macizo colombiano " ) in three ranges ( east andes , central andes and west andes ) that form two long valleys , magdalena and cauca follow by the rivers of the same name .
the eastern half of colombia , comprising more than half its territory , is plain and composed by savanna and rainforest , crossed by rivers belonging to the amazon and orinoco basins .
the northern part , called " los llanos " is a savanna region , mostly in the orinoco basin ( therefore called also orinoquía ) .
the southern part is covered by the amazon rain forest and belongs mostly to the amazon basin .
it is usually called amazonía .
at the north and west of the andes range there are some coastal plains .
the caribbean plains at the north and the pacific plains at the west .
colombian pacific plains are among the most rainy parts in the world , chiefly at the north ( chocó ) .
the highest mountain in colombia is not in the andes but in the caribbean plain : sierra nevada de santa marta with its highest points named pico cristobal colon ( *num* m ) and pico simon bolivar ( same elevation ) .
other mountains in the caribbean plain include the montes de maría and the serranía de san lucas .
in the pacific plains there are other mountain formations , chiefly the serranía del darién and the serranía del baudó .
in the eastern region , there is the serranía de la macarena and there are formations belonging to the guyana shield .
the natural resources of colombia are varied and extensive with most of its territory and oceans still unexplored .
colombia has one of the largest open pit coal mines in the world in the region of cerrejon in the guajira peninsula .
it also has oil rigs and natural gas extraction in the eastern plains .
colombia is the main producer of emeralds and an important participant in gold , silver , iron , salt , platinum , petroleum , nickel , copper , hydropower and uranium extraction .
the main environmental issues affecting colombia are deforestation ; soil and water quality damage from overuse of pesticides ; air pollution , especially in bogota , from vehicle emissions and other main cities .
the collateral damaged produced by attacks against oil pipeline infrastructure by rebel guerrillas in the colombian armed conflict has produced long term damage to the environment .
the armed groups also deforest large areas to cultivate illegal crops and open unauthorized highways in protected areas .
snowfields and glaciers in colombia are limited to the highest peaks and ranges in the cordillera central and cordillera oriental and above the *num* , 700-meter elevation on the sierra nevada de santa marta .
the total area of snowfields and glaciers was estimated to be about *num* square kilometers in the early 1970s .
historical , geographical , and pictorial records point toward a consistent and progressive depletion of ice-and-snow masses in the colombian andes since the end of the " little ice age " in the late 1800s .
many glaciers have disappeared during the *ord* century , and others are expected to disappear in the coming decades .

alexander iii of russia alexander iii ( ; *num* *num* ) was the emperor of russia , king of poland , and grand duke of finland from until his death on .
he was highly conservative and reversed some of the liberal reforms of his father , alexander ii .
during alexander's reign russia fought no major wars , and he was therefore styled " the peacemaker " ( ) .
grand duke alexander alexandrovich was born on *num* march *num* at the winter palace in saint petersburg , russian empire , the second son and third child of emperor alexander ii and his first wife maria alexandrovna ( née princess marie of hesse ) .
in disposition alexander bore little resemblance to his soft-hearted , liberal father , and still less to his refined , philosophic , sentimental , chivalrous , yet cunning great-uncle , emperor alexander i , who could have been given the title of " the first gentleman of europe " .
although an enthusiastic amateur musician and patron of the ballet , alexander was seen as lacking refinement and elegance .
indeed , he rather relished the idea of being of the same rough texture as some of his subjects .
his straightforward , abrupt manner savoured sometimes of gruffness , while his direct , unadorned method of expressing himself harmonized well with his rough-hewn , immobile features and somewhat sluggish movements .
his education was not such as to soften these peculiarities .
more than six feet tall ( about *num* .
*num* m ) , he was also noted for his immense physical strength .
a sebaceous cyst on the left side of his nose caused him to be mocked by some of his contemporaries , and he sat for photographs and portraits with the right side of his face most prominent .
an account from the memoirs of the artist alexander benois gives one impression of alexander iii : after a performance of the ballet " tsar kandavl " at the mariinsky theatre , i first caught sight of the emperor .
i was struck by the size of the man , and although cumbersome and heavy , he was still a mighty figure .
there was indeed something of the muzhik " [ russian peasant ] " about him .
the look of his bright eyes made quite an impression on me .
as he passed where i was standing , he raised his head for a second , and to this day i can remember what i felt as our eyes met .
it was a look as cold as steel , in which there was something threatening , even frightening , and it struck me like a blow .
the tsar's gaze ! the look of a man who stood above all others , but who carried a monstrous burden and who every minute had to fear for his life and the lives of those closest to him .
in later years i came into contact with the emperor on several occasions , and i felt not the slightest bit timid .
in more ordinary cases tsar alexander iii could be at once kind , simple , and even almost homely .
though he was destined to be a strongly counter-reforming emperor , alexander had little prospect of succeeding to the throne during the first two decades of his life , as he had an elder brother , nicholas , who seemed of robust constitution .
even when nicholas first displayed symptoms of delicate health , the notion that he might die young was never taken seriously , and he was betrothed to princess dagmar of denmark , daughter of king christian ix of denmark and queen louise of denmark , and whose siblings included king frederick viii of denmark , alexandra , queen of the united kingdom and king george i of greece .
great solicitude was devoted to the education of nicholas as tsesarevich , whereas alexander received only the training of an ordinary grand duke of that period .
this included acquaintance with french , english and german , and military drill .
alexander became tsesarevich upon nicholas's sudden death in *num* ; it was then that he began to study the principles of law and administration under konstantin pobedonostsev , then a professor of civil law at moscow state university and later ( from *num* ) chief procurator of the holy synod of the orthodox church in russia .
pobedonostsev instilled into the young man's mind the belief that zeal for russian orthodox thought was an essential factor of russian patriotism to be cultivated by every right-minded emperor .
while he was heir apparent from *num* to *num* alexander did not play a prominent part in public affairs , but allowed it to become known that he had ideas which did not coincide with the principles of the existing government .
on his deathbed the previous tsesarevich was said to have expressed the wish that his fiancée , princess dagmar of denmark , should marry his successor .
this wish was swiftly realized when on in the grand church of the winter palace in st .
petersburg , alexander wed dagmar , who converted to orthodox christianity and took the name maria feodorovna .
the union proved a happy one to the end ; unlike his father's , there was no adultery in his marriage .
the couple spent their wedding night at the tsesarevich's private dacha known as " my property " .
later on the tsesarevich became estranged from his father ; this was due to their vastly differing political views , as well was his resentment towards alexander ii's long-standing relationship with catherine dolgorukov ( with whom he had several illegitimate children ) while his mother , the empress , was suffering from chronic ill-health .
to the scandal of many at court , including the tsesarevich himself , alexander ii married catherine a mere month after marie alexandrovna's death in *num* .
on *num* march *num* ( o .
s .
) alexander's father , alexander ii , was assassinated by members of the terrorist organization narodnaya volya .
as a result , he ascended to the russian imperial throne in nennal on *num* march *num* .
he and maria feodorovna were officially crowned and anointed at the assumption cathedral in moscow on *num* may *num* .
alexander's ascension to the throne was followed by an outbreak of anti-jewish riots .
alexander iii disliked the extravagance of the rest of his family .
it was also expensive for the crown to pay so many grand dukes each year .
each one received an annual salary of *num* , *num* rubles , and grand duchesses received a dowry of a million when they married .
he limited the title of grand duke and duchess to only children and male-line grandchildren of emperors .
the rest would bear a princely title and the style of serene highness .
he also forbade morganatic marriages , as well as those outside of the orthodoxy .
on the day of his assassination alexander ii had signed an ukaz setting up consultative commissions to advise the monarch .
on ascending to the throne , however , alexander iii took pobedonostsev's advice and canceled the policy before its publication .
he made it clear that his autocracy would not be limited .
all of alexander iii's internal reforms aimed to reverse the liberalization that had occurred in his father's reign .
the new emperor believed that remaining true to russian orthodoxy , autocracy , and nationality ( the ideology introduced by his grandfather , emperor nicholas i ) would save russia from revolutionary agitation .
alexander's political ideal was a nation composed of a single nationality , language , and religion , as well as one form of administration .
he attempted to realize this by the institution of mandatory teaching of the russian language throughout the empire , including to his german , polish , and other non-russian subjects ( with the exception of the finns ) , by the patronization of eastern orthodoxy , by the destruction of the remnants of german , polish , and swedish institutions in the respective provinces , and by the weakening of judaism through persecution of the jews .
the latter policy was implemented in the " may laws " of *num* , which banned jews from inhabiting rural areas and shtetls ( even within the pale of settlement ) and restricted the occupations in which they could engage .
alexander weakened the power of the " zemstvo " ( elective local administrative bodies resembling british parish councils ) and placed the administration of peasant communes under the supervision of land-owning proprietors appointed by his government .
these " land captains " ( " zemskiye nachalniki " ) were feared and resented throughout the empire's peasant communities .
these acts weakened the nobility and the peasantry and brought imperial administration under the emperor's personal control .
in such policies alexander iii had the encouragement of konstantin pobedonostsev , who retained control of the church in russia through his long tenure as procurator of the holy synod ( from *num* to *num* ) and who became tutor to alexander's son and heir , nicholas .
( pobedonostsev appears as " toporov " in tolstoy's novel " resurrection " .
) other conservative advisors included count d .
a .
tolstoy ( minister of education , and later of internal affairs ) and i .
n .
durnovo ( d .
a .
tolstoy's successor in the latter post ) .
mikhail katkov and other journalists supported the emperor in his autocracy .
encouraged by its successful assassination of alexander ii , the narodnaya volya movement began planning the murder of alexander iii .
the okhrana uncovered the plot and five of the conspirators , including alexander ulyanov , the older brother of vladimir lenin , were captured and hanged on .
the famine of 1891–1892 and the ensuing cholera epidemic permitted some liberal activity , as the russian government could not cope with the crisis and had to allow zemstvos to help with relief ( among others , tolstoy helped organize soup-kitchens , and chekhov directed anti-cholera precautions in several villages ) .
in foreign affairs alexander iii was a man of peace , but not at any price , and held that the best means of averting war is to be well-prepared for it .
diplomat nikolay girs , scion of a rich and powerful family of scandinavian descent , served as his foreign minister , 1882-1895 , and established the peaceful policies for which alexander has been given credit .
girs was an architect of the franco-russian alliance of *num* , which was later expanded into the triple entente with the addition of great britain .
that alliance brought france out of diplomatic isolation , and moved russia from the german orbit to a coalition with france , that was strongly supported by french financial assistance to russia's economic modernization .
girs was in charge of a diplomacy that featured numerous negotiated settlements , treaties and conventions .
these agreements defined russian boundaries and restored equilibrium to dangerously unstable situations .
the most dramatic success came in *num* , settling long-standing tensions with great britain , which was fearful that russian expansion to the south would be a threat to india .
girs was usually successful in restraining the aggressive inclinations of tsar alexander convincing him that the very survival of the czarist system depended on avoiding major wars .
with a deep insight into the tsar's moods and views , girs was usually able to shape the final decisions by outmaneuvering hostile journalists , ministers , and even the czarina , as well as his own ambassadors .
his russia fought no wars .
though alexander was indignant at the conduct of german chancellor otto von bismarck towards russia , he avoided an open rupture with germany—even reviving the league of three emperors for a period of time—and in *num* , signed the reinsurance treaty with the germans .
however , in *num* , the expiration of the treaty coincided with the dismissal of bismarck by the new german emperor , kaiser wilhelm ii ( for whom the tsar had an immense dislike ) , and the unwillingness of wilhelm ii's government to renew the treaty .
in response alexander iii then began cordial relations with france , eventually entering into an alliance with the french in *num* .
despite chilly relations with berlin , the tsar nevertheless confined himself to keeping a large number of troops near the german frontier .
with regard to bulgaria he exercised similar self-control .
the efforts of prince alexander and afterwards of stambolov to destroy russian influence in the principality roused his indignation , but he vetoed all proposals to intervene by force of arms .
in central asian affairs he followed the traditional policy of gradually extending russian domination without provoking conflict with the united kingdom ( see panjdeh incident ) , and he never allowed the bellicose partisans of a forward policy to get out of hand .
his reign cannot be regarded as an eventful period of russian history ; but under his hard rule the country made considerable progress .
alexander and his wife regularly spent their summers at langinkoski manor near kotka on the finnish coast , where their children were immersed in a scandinavian lifestyle of relative modesty .
alexander deprecated foreign influence , german influence in particular , thus the adoption of local national principles was off in all spheres of official activity , with a view to realizing his ideal of a russia homogeneous in language , administration and religion .
these ideas conflicted with those of his father , who had german sympathies despite being a patriot ; alexander ii often used the german language in his private relations , occasionally ridiculed the slavophiles and based his foreign policy on the prussian alliance .
some differences had first appeared during the franco-prussian war , when alexander ii supported the cabinet of berlin while the tsesarevich made no effort to conceal his sympathies for the french .
these sentiments would resurface during 1875-1879 , when the eastern question excited russian society .
at first the tsesarevich was more slavophile than the government , but his phlegmatic nature restrained him from many exaggerations , and any popular illusions he may have imbibed were dispelled by personal observation in bulgaria , where he commanded the left wing of the invading army .
never consulted on political questions , alexander confined himself to military duties and fulfilled them in a conscientious and unobtrusive manner .
after many mistakes and disappointments , the army reached constantinople and the treaty of san stefano was signed , but much that had been obtained by that important document had to be sacrificed at the congress of berlin .
bismarck failed to do what was expected of him by the russian emperor .
in return for the russian support which had enabled him to create the german empire , it was thought that he would help russia to solve the eastern question in accordance with russian interests , but to the surprise and indignation of the cabinet of saint petersburg he confined himself to acting the part of " honest broker " at the congress , and shortly afterwards contracted an alliance with austria-hungary for the purpose of counteracting russian designs in eastern europe .
the tsesarevich could refer to these results as confirmation of the views he had expressed during the franco-prussian war ; he concluded that for russia , the best thing was to recover as quickly as possible from her temporary exhaustion , and prepare for future contingencies by military and naval reorganization .
in accordance with this conviction , he suggested that certain reforms should be introduced .
following his father's assassination , alexander iii was advised that it would be difficult for him to be kept safe at the winter palace .
as a result , alexander relocated his family to the gatchina palace , located twenty miles south of st .
petersburg , making it his primary residence .
under heavy guard he would make occasional visits into st .
petersburg , but even then he would stay in the anichkov palace , as opposed to the winter palace .
in the 1860s alexander fell madly in love with his mother's lady-in-waiting , princess maria elimovna meshcherskaya .
dismayed to learn that prince wittgenstein had proposed to her in early *num* , he told his parents that he was prepared to give up his rights of succession in order to marry his beloved " dusenka " .
on *num* may *num* , alexander ii informed his son that russia had come to an agreement with the parents of princess dagmar of denmark , his fourth cousin .
before then , she had been the fiancée of his late elder brother nicholas .
at first alexander refused to travel to copenhagen , declaring that he did not love dagmar and his desire to marry maria .
in response the enraged emperor ordered alexander to go straight to denmark and propose to princess dagmar .
the tsesarevich then realised that he was not a free man and that duty had to come first and foremost ; the only thing left to do was to write in his diary " farewell , dear dusenka .
" maria was forced to leave russia , accompanied by her aunt , princess chernyshova .
almost a year after her first appearance in paris , pavel pavlovich demidov , *ord* prince di san donato , fell in love with her and the couple married in *num* .
maria would die giving birth to her son elim pavlovich demidov , *ord* prince di san donato .
alexander's reaction to the news of her death and the birth of her child is unknown .
alexander soon grew fond of dagmar and had six children by her , five of whom survived into adulthood : nicholas ( b .
*num* ) , george ( b .
*num* ) , xenia ( b .
*num* ) , michael ( b .
*num* ) and olga ( b .
*num* ) .
of his five surviving children , he was closest to his youngest two .
in *num* it was alexander who commissioned peter carl fabergé to produce the first of what were to become a series of jeweled easter eggs ( now called " fabergé eggs " ) for her as an easter gift , the first hen egg , which delighted her immensely and became an annual easter tradition for alexander and , upon his succession , for his son nicholas as well .
each summer his parents-in-law , king christian ix and queen louise , held family reunions at the danish royal palaces of fredensborg and bernstorff , bringing alexander , maria and their children to denmark .
his sister-in-law , the princess of wales , would come from great britain with some of her children , and his brother-in-law , king george i of greece , his wife , queen olga , who was a first cousin of alexander and a romanov grand duchess by birth , came with their children from athens .
in contrast to the strict security observed in russia , alexander and maria revelled in the relative freedom that they enjoyed in denmark , alexander once commenting to the prince and princess of wales near the end of a visit that he envied them being able to return to a happy home in england , while he was returning to his russian prison .
in denmark , he was able to enjoy joining his children in muddy ponds looking for tadpoles , sneaking into his father-in-law's orchard to steal apples , and playing pranks , such as turning a water hose on the visiting king oscar ii of sweden .
as tsesarevich—and then as tsar—alexander had an extremely poor relationship with his brother grand duke vladimir .
this tension was reflected in the rivalry between maria feodorovna and vladimir's wife , grand duchess marie pavlovna .
alexander had better relationships with his other brothers : alexei ( whom he made rear admiral and then a grand admiral of the russian navy ) , sergei ( whom he made governor of moscow ) and paul .
despite the antipathy that alexander had towards his stepmother , princess catherine dolgorukov , he nevertheless allowed her to remain in the winter palace for some time after his father's assassination and to retain various keepsakes of him .
these included alexander ii's blood-soaked uniform that he died wearing , and his reading glasses .
on the imperial train derailed in an accident at borki .
at the moment of the crash , the imperial family was in the dining car .
its roof collapsed , and alexander held its remains on his shoulders as the children fled outdoors .
the onset of alexander’s kidney failure was later attributed to the blunt trauma suffered in this incident .
in *num* , alexander iii became ill with terminal kidney disease ( nephritis ) .
maria fyodorovna's sister-in-law , queen olga of greece , offered her villa of mon repos , on the island of corfu , in the hope that it might improve the tsar's condition .
by the time that they reached crimea , they stayed at the maly palace in livadia , as alexander was too weak to travel any further .
recognizing that the tsar's days were numbered , various imperial relatives began to descend on livadia .
even the famed clergyman john of kronstadt paid a visit and administered communion to the tsar .
on *num* october , alexander received nicholas's fiancée , princess alix , who had come from her native darmstadt to receive the tsar's blessing .
despite being exceedingly weak , alexander insisted on receiving alix in full dress uniform , an event that left him exhausted .
soon after , his health began to deteriorate more rapidly .
he died in the arms of his wife , and in the presence of his physician , ernst viktor von leyden , at maly palace in livadia on the afternoon of at the age of forty-nine , and was succeeded by his eldest son tsesarevich nicholas , who took the throne as nicholas ii .
after leaving livadia on *num* november and traveling to st .
petersburg by way of moscow , his remains were interred on *num* november at the peter and paul fortress .
alexander iii had six children ( five of whom survived to adulthood ) of his marriage with princess dagmar of denmark , also known as marie feodorovna .
in *num* , a bronze equestrian statue of alexander iii sculpted by paolo troubetzkoy was placed in znamenskaya square in front of the moscow rail terminal in st .
petersburg .
both the horse and rider were sculpted in massive form , leading to the nickname of " hippopotamus " .
troubetzkoy envisioned the statue as a caricature , jesting that he wished " to portray an animal atop another animal " , and it was quite controversial at the time , with many , including the members of the imperial family , opposed to the design , but it was approved because of the empress dowager unexpectedly liking the monument .
following the revolution of *num* the statue remained in place as a symbol of tsarist autocracy until *num* when it was placed in storage .
in *num* it was again put on public display , in front of the marble palace .
another memorial is located in the city of irkutsk at the angara embankment .
on *num* november *num* , vladimir putin unveiled a bronze monument to alexander iii on the site of the former maly livadia palace in crimea .
the four-meter monument by russian sculptor andrey kovalchuk depicts alexander iii sitting on a stump , his stretched arms resting on a sabre .
an inscription repeats his alleged saying “"russia has only two allies : the army and the navy .
church of england the church of england ( c of e ) is the established church of england .
the archbishop of canterbury is the most senior cleric , although the monarch is the supreme governor .
the church of england is also the mother church of the international anglican communion .
it traces its history to the christian church recorded as existing in the roman province of britain by the third century , and to the 6th-century gregorian mission to kent led by augustine of canterbury .
the english church renounced papal authority when henry viii failed to secure an annulment of his marriage to catherine of aragon in *num* .
the english reformation accelerated under edward vi's regents , before a brief restoration of papal authority under queen mary i and king philip .
the act of supremacy *num* renewed the breach , and the elizabethan settlement charted a course enabling the english church to describe itself as both catholic and reformed : in the earlier phase of the english reformation there were both catholic martyrs and radical protestant martyrs .
the later phases saw the penal laws punish roman catholic and nonconforming protestants .
in the *ord* century , the puritan and presbyterian factions continued to challenge the leadership of the church which under the stuarts veered towards a more catholic interpretation of the elizabethan settlement especially under archbishop laud and the rise of the concept of anglicanism as the via media .
after the victory of the parliamentarians the prayer book was abolished and the presbyterian and independent factions dominated .
the episcopacy was abolished .
the restoration restored the church of england , episcopacy and the prayer book .
papal recognition of george iii in *num* led to greater religious tolerance .
since the english reformation , the church of england has used a liturgy in english .
the church contains several doctrinal strands , the main three known as anglo-catholic , evangelical and broad church .
tensions between theological conservatives and progressives find expression in debates over the ordination of women and homosexuality .
the church includes both liberal and conservative clergy and members .
the governing structure of the church is based on dioceses , each presided over by a bishop .
within each diocese are local parishes .
the general synod of the church of england is the legislative body for the church and comprises bishops , other clergy and laity .
its measures must be approved by both houses of parliament .
according to tradition , christianity arrived in britain in the *ord* or *ord* century , during which time southern britain became part of the roman empire .
the earliest historical evidence of christianity among the native britons is found in the writings of such early christian fathers as tertullian and origen in the first years of the *ord* century .
three romano-british bishops , including restitutus , are known to have been present at the council of arles in *num* .
others attended the council of serdica in *num* and that of ariminum in *num* , and a number of references to the church in roman britain are found in the writings of *ord* century christian fathers .
britain was the home of pelagius , who opposed augustine of hippo's doctrine of original sin .
while christianity was long established as the religion of the britons at the time of the anglo-saxon invasion , christian britons made little progress in converting the newcomers from their native paganism .
consequently , in *num* , pope gregory i sent the prior of the abbey of st andrew's ( later canonised as augustine of canterbury ) from rome to evangelise the angles .
this event is known as the gregorian mission and is the date the church of england generally marks as the beginning of its formal history .
with the help of christians already residing in kent , augustine established his church at canterbury , the capital of the kingdom of kent , and became the first in the series of archbishops of canterbury in *num* .
a later archbishop , the greek theodore of tarsus , also contributed to the organisation of christianity in england .
the church of england has been in continuous existence since the days of st augustine , with the archbishop of canterbury as its episcopal head .
despite the various disruptions of the reformation and the english civil war , the church of england considers itself to be the same church which was more formally organised by augustine .
while some celtic christian practices were changed at the synod of whitby , the christian in the british isles was under papal authority from earliest times .
queen bertha of kent was among the christians in england who recognised papal authority before augustine arrived , and celtic christians were carrying out missionary work with papal approval long before the synod of whitby .
the synod of whitby established the roman date for easter and the roman style of monastic tonsure in england .
this meeting of the ecclesiastics with roman customs with local bishops was summoned in *num* at saint hilda's double monastery of streonshalh ( streanæshalch ) , later called whitby abbey .
it was presided over by king oswiu , who did not engage in the debate but made the final ruling .
the final ruling was decided in favor of roman tradition because st .
peter holds the keys to the gate of heaven .
in *num* , king henry viii separated the english church from rome .
a theological separation had been foreshadowed by various movements within the english church , such as lollardy , but the english reformation gained political support when henry viii wanted an annulment of his marriage to catherine of aragon so he could marry anne boleyn .
pope clement vii , considering that the earlier marriage had been entered under a papal dispensation and how catherine's nephew , emperor charles v , might react to such a move , refused the annulment .
eventually , henry , although theologically opposed to protestantism , took the position of supreme head of the church of england to ensure the annulment of his marriage .
he was excommunicated by pope paul iii .
in 1536–40 henry viii engaged in the dissolution of the monasteries , which controlled much of the richest land .
he disbanded monasteries , priories , convents and friaries in england , wales and ireland , appropriated their income , disposed of their assets , and provided pensions for the former residents .
the properties were sold to pay for the wars .
bernard argues : henry maintained a strong preference for traditional catholic practices and , during his reign , protestant reformers were unable to make many changes to the practices of the church of england .
indeed , this part of henry's reign saw trials for heresy of protestants as well as roman catholics .
under his son , king edward vi , more protestant-influenced forms of worship were adopted .
under the leadership of the archbishop of canterbury , thomas cranmer , a more radical reformation proceeded .
a new pattern of worship was set out in the book of common prayer ( *num* and *num* ) .
these were based on the older liturgy in particular the prayer book of *num* , but both influenced by protestant doctrines such as justification by faith alone , the rejection of the sacrifice of the mass , and the real presence understood as physical presence ( cranmer was calvinist in that he believed christ was truly and really present in the eucharist but after a spiritual manner , although the words of administration at the time of communion were a straightforward statement in the real presence as taken from the *num* bcp and attached to the *num* book ) .
the confession of the reformed church of england was set out in the forty-two articles ( later revised to thirty-nine ) .
the reformation however was cut short by the death of the king .
queen mary i , who succeeded him , returned england again to the authority of the papacy , thereby ending the first attempt at an independent church of england .
during her co-reign with her husband , king philip , many leaders and common people were burnt for their refusal to recant of their reformed faith .
these are known as the marian martyrs and the persecution led to her nickname of " bloody mary " .
mary also died childless and so it was left to the new regime of her half-sister elizabeth to resolve the direction of the church .
the settlement under queen elizabeth i ( from *num* ) , known as the elizabethan settlement , tried to find a middle way between radical protestantism and roman catholicism , the " via media " ( a term that actually only became current in the 1620s ) , as the character of the church of england , a church moderately reformed in doctrine , as expressed in the thirty-nine articles , but also emphasising continuity with the catholic and apostolic traditions of the church fathers .
kneeling reverently to receive communion was the custom .
the three-fold ministry in the apostolic succession was maintained ; the institutional continuity of the church was preserved without break ( at her accession almost all clergy had been ordained in catholic orders using the roman pontifical ) by consecration of bishops in catholics orders , although the character of the organization was changed by the adoption of some reformed doctrines , the simplification of the outwards forms of worship and the abandonment of traditional vestments and art work ; the retention of medieval canon law , liturgical music and a much shortened calendar of saints and feast days .
it was a most peculiar situation : the same organization but with a modified face to the world without much particular character of its own until the notion of anglicanism as a distinct variety of christianity emerged very late in her reign and during the reigns of the early stuart kings .
it was also an established church ( constitutionally established by the state with the head of state as its supreme governor ) .
the exact nature of the relationship between church and state would be a source of continued friction into the next century .
for the next century , through the reigns of james i , who ordered the translation of the bible known as the king james version ( authorized to be used in parishes which does not mean it was the official version ) , and charles i , culminating in the english civil war and the protectorate of oliver cromwell , there were significant swings back and forth between two factions : the puritans ( and other radicals ) who sought more far-reaching protestant reforms , and the more conservative churchmen who aimed to keep closer to traditional beliefs and catholic practices .
the failure of political and ecclesiastical authorities to submit to puritan demands for more extensive reform was one of the causes of open warfare .
by continental standards the level of violence over religion was not high , since the civil war was mainly about politics , but the casualties included king charles i and the archbishop of canterbury , william laud and tens of thousands of civilians who died from the unsettled conditions .
under the commonwealth and the protectorate of england from *num* to *num* , the bishops were dethroned and former practices were outlawed , and presbyterian ecclesiology was introduced in place of the episcopate .
the *num* articles were replaced by the westminster confession , the book of common prayer by the directory of public worship .
despite this , about one quarter of english clergy refused to conform to this form of state presbyterianism .
with the restoration of charles ii , parliament restored the church of england to a form not far removed from the elizabethan version .
one difference was that the ideal of encompassing all the people of england in one religious organisation , taken for granted by the tudors , had to be abandoned .
the religious landscape of england assumed its present form , with the anglican established church occupying the middle ground , and those puritans and protestants who dissented from the anglican establishment having to continue their existence outside the national church rather than trying to influence or trying to gain control of it .
one result of the restoration was the ousting of *num* , *num* parish ministers who had not been ordained by bishops in the apostolic succession or who had been ordained by ministers in presbyter's orders .
official suspicion and legal restrictions continued well into the *ord* century .
roman catholics , perhaps *num* % of the english population ( down from *num* % in *num* ) were grudgingly tolerated , having had little or no official representation after the pope's excommunication of queen elizabeth in *num* , though the stuarts were sympathetic to them .
by the end of *ord* century they had dwindled to *num* % of the population mostly among eccentric upper middle-class gentry and their tenants and extended families .
by the fifth article of the union with ireland *num* , the church of england and church of ireland were united into " one protestant episcopal church , to be called , the united church of england and ireland " .
although this union was declared " an essential and fundamental part of the union " , the irish church act *num* separated the irish part of the church again and disestablished it , the act coming into effect on *num* january *num* .
as the british empire expanded , british colonists and colonial administrators took the established church doctrines and practices together with ordained ministry and formed overseas branches of the church of england .
as they developed or , beginning with the united states of america , became sovereign or independent states , many of their churches became separate organisationally but remained linked to the church of england through the anglican communion .
in bermuda , the oldest remaining english colony ( now designated a british overseas territory ) , the first church of england services were performed by the reverend richard buck , one of the survivors of the *num* wreck of the " sea venture " which initiated bermuda's permanent settlement .
the nine parishes of the church of england in bermuda , each with its own church and glebe land , rarely had more than a pair of ordained ministers to share between them until the nineteenth century .
from *num* to *num* , bermuda's parishes were attached to the see of nova scotia .
bermuda was then grouped into the new diocese of newfoundland and bermuda from *num* .
in *num* , the synod of the church of england in bermuda was formed .
at the same time , a diocese of bermuda became separate from the diocese of newfoundland , but both continued to be grouped under the " bishop of newfoundland and bermuda " until *num* , when newfoundland and bermuda each received its own bishop .
the church of england in bermuda was renamed in *num* as the anglican church of bermuda , which is an extra-provincial diocese , with both metropolitan and primatial authority coming directly from the archbishop of canterbury .
among its parish churches is st peter's church in the unesco world heritage site of st george's town , which is both the oldest anglican and the oldest non-roman catholic church in the new world .
under the guidance of rowan williams and with significant pressure from clergy union representatives , the ecclesiastical penalty for convicted felons to be defrocked was set aside from the clergy discipline measure *num* .
the clergy union argued that the penalty was unfair to victims of hypothetical miscarriages of criminal justice , because the ecclesiastical penalty is considered irreversible .
although clerics can still be banned for life from ministry , they remain ordained as priests .
the archbishops of canterbury and york warned in january *num* that the church of england will no longer be able to carry on in its current form unless the downward spiral in membership is somehow reversed as typical sunday attendances had halved to *num* , *num* in the previous *num* years : however , sarah mullally , the fourth woman chosen to become a bishop in the church of england , insisted in june *num* that declining numbers at services should not necessarily be a cause of despair for churches because people will still " encounter god " without ever taking their place in a pew , saying that people might hear the christian message through social media sites such as facebook or in a café run as a community project .
additionally , the church's own statistics reveal that *num* .
*num* million people visit at least one of its churches every year and *num* million students are educated at church of england schools ( which number *num* , *num* ) .
approximately *num* church of england parish churches are declared " closed for regular public worship " ( previously termed " redundant " ) each year .
between *num* and *num* , a full *num* closures were achieved , equalling roughly *num* % of the stock , with just over a third being listed buildings , either grade i or ii .
of these , closures , only *num* were made since *num* .
some active use is made of about half of the closed churches .
in *num* the church of england admitted that it was embarrassed to be paying staff under the living wage .
the church of england had previously campaigned for all employers to pay this minimum amount .
the archbishop of canterbury acknowledged it was not the only area where the church " fell short of its standards " .
the canon law of the church of england identifies the christian scriptures as the source of its doctrine .
in addition , doctrine is also derived from the teachings of the church fathers and ecumenical councils ( as well as the ecumenical creeds ) in so far as these agree with scripture .
this doctrine is expressed in the thirty-nine articles of religion , the book of common prayer , and the ordinal containing the rites for the ordination of deacons , priests , and the consecration of bishops .
unlike other traditions , the church of england has no single theologian that it can look to as a founder .
however , richard hooker's appeal to scripture , church tradition , and reason as sources of authority continue to inform anglican identity .
the church of england's doctrinal character today is largely the result of the elizabethan settlement , which sought to establish a comprehensive middle way between roman catholicism and protestantism .
the church of england affirms the protestant reformation principle that scripture contains all things necessary to salvation and is the final arbiter in doctrinal matters .
the thirty-nine articles are the church's only official confessional statement .
though not a complete system of doctrine , the articles highlight areas of agreement with lutheran and reformed positions , while differentiating anglicanism from roman catholicism and anabaptism .
while embracing some themes of the protestant reformation , the church of england also maintains catholic traditions of the ancient church and teachings of the church fathers , unless these are considered contrary to scripture .
it accepts the decisions of the first four ecumenical councils concerning the trinity and the incarnation .
the church of england also preserves catholic order by adhering to episcopal polity , with ordained orders of bishops , priests and deacons .
there are differences of opinion within the church of england over the necessity of episcopacy .
some consider it essential , while others feel it is needed for the proper ordering of the church .
in sum these express the ' via media ' viewpoint that the first five centuries of doctrinal development and church order as approved as acceptable be a kind of yardstick by which to gauge authentic catholicity , as minimum and sufficient ; anglicanism did not emerge as the result of charismatic leaders with particular doctrines .
it is light on details compared to roman catholic , reformed and lutheran teachings .
the bible , the creeds , apostolic order , and the administration of the sacraments are sufficient to establish catholicity .
indeed , not one major doctrinal development emerged from the english reformation , per diarmid macculloch , the later reformation in england , *num* , p .
*num* .
the reformation in england was initially much concerned about doctrine but the elizabethan settlement tried to put a stop to doctrinal contentions .
the proponents of further changes , nonetheless , tried to get their way by making changes in church order ( abolition of bishops ) , governance ( canon law ) and liturgy ( ' too catholic ' ) .
they did not succeed because the monarchy , the church and resisted and the majority of the population were indifferent .
moreover , " despite all the assumptions of the reformation founders of that church , it had retained a catholic character .
" the elizabethan settlement had created a cuckoo in a nest .
.
.
" a protestant theology and program within a largely pre-reformation catholic structure whose continuing life would arouse a theological interest in the catholicism that had created it ; and would result in the rejection of predestinarian theology in favor of sacraments , especially the eucharist , ceremonial , and anti-calvinist doctrine " ( ibid pp .
78–86 ) .
the existence of cathedrals " without substantial alteration " and " where the " old devotional world cast its longest shadow for the future of the ethos that would become anglicanism , " p .
*num* .
this is " one of the great mysteries of the english reformation , " ibid that there was no complete break with the past but a muddle that was per force turned into a virtue .
the story of the english reformation is the tale of retreat from the protestant advance of *num* which could not proceed further in the face of the opposition of the institution which was rooted in the medieval past , ibid .
p .
*num* and the adamant opposition of queen elizabeth i .
the church of england has , as one of its distinguishing marks , a breadth and " open-mindedness " .
this tolerance has allowed anglicans who emphasise the catholic tradition and others who emphasise the reformed tradition to coexist .
the three " parties " ( see churchmanship ) in the church of england are sometimes called high church ( or anglo-catholic ) , low church ( or evangelical anglican ) and broad church ( or liberal ) .
the high church party places importance on the church of england's continuity with the pre-reformation catholic church , adherence to ancient liturgical usages and the sacerdotal nature of the priesthood .
as their name suggests , anglo-catholics maintain many traditional catholic practices and liturgical forms .
the low church party is more protestant in both ceremony and theology .
historically , broad church has been used to describe those of middle-of-the-road ceremonial preferences who lean theologically towards liberal protestantism .
the balance between these strands of churchmanship is not static : in *num* , *num* % of church of england worshippers attended evangelical churches ( compared with *num* % in *num* ) , and *num* % of very large congregations were evangelical .
such churches were also reported to attract higher numbers of men and young adults than others .
the church of england's official book of liturgy as established in english law is the " book of common prayer " ( bcp ) .
in addition to this book the general synod has also legislated for a modern liturgical book , " common worship " , dating from *num* , which can be used as an alternative to the bcp .
like its predecessor , the *num* " alternative service book " , it differs from the " book of common prayer " in providing a range of alternative services , mostly in modern language , although it does include some bcp-based forms as well , for example order two for holy communion .
( this is a revision of the bcp service , altering some words and allowing the insertion of some other liturgical texts such as the " agnus dei " before communion .
) the order one rite follows the pattern of more modern liturgical scholarship .
the liturgies are organised according to the traditional liturgical year and the calendar of saints .
the sacraments of baptism and the eucharist are generally thought necessary to salvation .
infant baptism is practised .
at a later age , individuals baptised as infants receive confirmation by a bishop , at which time they reaffirm the baptismal promises made by their parents or sponsors .
the eucharist , consecrated by a thanksgiving prayer including christ's words of institution , is believed to be " a memorial of christ's once-for-all redemptive acts in which christ is objectively present and effectually received in faith " .
the use of hymns and music in the church of england has changed dramatically over the centuries .
traditional choral evensong is a staple of most cathedrals .
the style of psalm chanting harks back to the church of england's pre-reformation roots .
during the *ord* century , clergy such as charles wesley introduced their own styles of worship with poetic hymns .
in the latter half of the *ord* century , the influence of the charismatic movement significantly altered the worship traditions of numerous church of england parishes , primarily affecting those of evangelical persuasion .
these churches now adopt a contemporary worship form of service , with minimal liturgical or ritual elements , and incorporating contemporary worship music .
women were appointed as deaconesses from *num* , but they could not function fully as deacons and were not considered ordained clergy .
women have been lay readers for a long time .
during the first world war , some women were appointed as lay readers , known as " bishop's messengers " , who also led missions and ran churches in the absence of men .
after that no more lay readers were appointed until *num* .
legislation authorising the ordination of women as deacons was passed in *num* and they were first ordained in *num* .
the ordination of women as priests was passed by the general synod in *num* and began in *num* .
in *num* , for the first time in the history of the church of england , more women than men were ordained as priests ( *num* women and *num* men ) .
in july *num* , the synod voted to " set in train " the process of allowing the consecration of women as bishops .
in february *num* , the synod voted overwhelmingly for the " further exploration " of possible arrangements for parishes that did not want to be directly under the authority of a bishop who is a woman .
on *num* july *num* , the synod voted to approve the ordination of women as bishops and rejected moves for alternative episcopal oversight for those who do not accept the ministry of bishops who are women .
actual ordinations of women to the episcopate required further legislation , which was narrowly rejected in a vote at general synod in november *num* .
on *num* november *num* , the general synod voted overwhelmingly in support of a plan to allow the ordination of women as bishops , with *num* in favour , *num* against and *num* abstentions .
on *num* july *num* , the general synod approved the ordination of women as bishops .
the house of bishops recorded *num* votes in favour , two against with one abstention .
the house of clergy had *num* in favour , *num* against and four abstentions .
the house of laity voted *num* for , *num* against with five abstentions .
this legislation had to be approved by the ecclesiastical committee of the parliament before it could be finally implemented at the november *num* synod .
in december *num* , libby lane was announced as the first woman to become a bishop in the church of england .
she was consecrated as a bishop in january *num* .
in july *num* , rachel treweek was the first woman to become a diocesan bishop in the church of england when she became the bishop of gloucester .
she and sarah mullally , bishop of crediton , were the first women to be ordained as bishops at canterbury cathedral .
treweek later made headlines by calling for gender-inclusive language , saying that " god is not to be seen as male .
god is god .
" in may *num* , the diocese of london consecrated dame sarah mullally as the first woman to serve as the bishop of london .
bishop sarah mullally occupies the third most senior position in the church of england .
mullally has described herself as a feminist and will ordain both men and women to the priesthood .
she is also considered by some to be a theological liberal .
on women's reproductive rights , mullally describes herself as pro-choice while also being personally pro-life .
on marriage , she supports the current stance of the church of england that marriage is between a man and a woman , but also said that : " it is a time for us to reflect on our tradition and scripture , and together say how we can offer a response that is about it being inclusive love .
" after the consecration of the first women as bishops , women and the church ( watch ) , a group supporting the ministries of women in the church of england , called for language referring to god as " mother " .
this call for more gender inclusive language has received the support of the rt rev alan wilson , the bishop of buckingham .
in *num* , the rev jody stowell , from watch , expressed her support for female images saying : " we're not restricted to understanding god with one gender .
i would encourage people to explore those kinds of images .
they're wholly biblical .
" the church of england has been discussing same-sex marriages and lgbt clergy .
" the church of england does not allow gay weddings , but its priests are allowed to be in a civil partnership .
" the church holds that marriage is a union of one man with one woman .
however , the church teaches " same-sex relationships often embody genuine mutuality and fidelity .
" the church also officially supports civil partnerships ; " we believe that civil partnerships still have a place , including for some christian lgbti couples who see them as a way of gaining legal recognition of their relationship .
" the " church of england does not conduct civil partnership ceremonies or same sex marriages but individual churches can conduct a service of thanksgiving after a ceremony .
" the church says " clergy in the church of england are permitted to offer prayers of support on a pastoral basis for people in same-sex relationships ; " as such , many anglican churches , with clergy open to it , " already bless same-sex couples on an unofficial basis .
" civil partnerships for clergy have been allowed since *num* .
the church extends pensions to clergy in civil unions .
in a missive to clergy , the church communicated that " there was a need for committed same-sex couples to be given recognition and ' compassionate attention ' from the church , including special prayers .
" " there is no prohibition on prayers ' being said in church or there being a ' service' " after a civil union .
after same-sex marriage was legalised , the church asked for the government to continue to offer civil unions saying " the church of england recognises that same-sex relationships often embody fidelity and mutuality .
civil partnerships enable these christian virtues to be recognised socially and legally in a proper framework .
" in *num* , the bishops released guidelines that permit " more informal kind of prayer " for couples .
in the guidelines , " gay couples who get married will be able to ask for special prayers in the church of england after their wedding , the bishops have agreed .
" in *num* , the bishop of grantham , the rt rev nicholas chamberlain , announced he is gay , in a same-sex relationship and celibate ; becoming the first bishop to do so in the church .
the church had decided in *num* that gay clergy in civil partnerships could become bishops .
" the house [ of bishops ] has confirmed that clergy in civil partnerships , and living in accordance with the teaching of the church on human sexuality , can be considered as candidates for the episcopate .
" in *num* , the house of clergy voted against the motion to ' take note ' of the bishops ' report defining marriage as between a man and a woman .
due to passage in all three houses being required , the motion was rejected .
after general synod rejected the motion , the archbishops of canterbury and york called for " radical new christian inclusion " that is " based on good , healthy , flourishing relationships , and in a proper *ord* century understanding of being human and of being sexual .
" the church officially opposes ' conversion ' therapy , a practice which attempts to change a gay or lesbian person's sexual orientation , calling it unethical and supports the banning of ' conversion ' therapy in the uk .
the diocese of hereford approved a motion calling for the church " to create a set of formal services and prayers to bless those who have had a same-sex marriage or civil partnership .
" regarding transgender issues , the *num* general synod voted in favour of a motion saying that transgender people should be " welcomed and affirmed in their parish church .
.
.
" the motion also asked the bishops " to look into special services for transgender people .
" the bishops initially said " the house notes that the affirmation of baptismal faith , found in " common worship " , is an ideal liturgical rite which trans people can use to mark this moment of personal renewal .
" the bishops also authorised services of celebration to mark a gender transition that will be included in formal liturgy .
transgender people may marry in the church of england after legally making a transition .
" since the gender recognition act [ *num* ] , trans people legally confirmed in their gender identity under its provisions are able to marry someone of the opposite sex in their parish church .
" since *num* , the church has allowed priests to undergo gender transition and remain in office .
the church has ordained openly transgender clergy since *num* .
just as the church of england has a large conservative or " traditionalist " wing , it also has many liberal members and clergy .
approximately one third of clergy " doubt or disbelieve in the physical resurrection " .
others , such as the revd giles fraser , a contributor to " the guardian " , have argued for an allegorical interpretation of the virgin birth of jesus .
" the independent " reported in *num* that , according to a yougov survey of church of england clergy , " as many as *num* per cent are unclear about god and two per cent think it is no more than a human construct .
" moreover , many congregations are seeker-friendly environments .
for example , one report from the church mission society suggested that the church open up " a pagan church where christianity [ is ] very much in the centre " to reach out to spiritual people .
the church of england is generally opposed to abortion but recognises that " there can be - strictly limited - conditions under which it may be morally preferable to any available alternative " .
the church also opposes euthanasia .
its official stance is that " while acknowledging the complexity of the issues involved in assisted dying / suicide and voluntary euthanasia , the church of england is opposed to any change in the law or in medical practice that would make assisted dying / suicide or voluntary euthanasia permissible in law or acceptable in practice .
" it also states that " equally , the church shares the desire to alleviate physical and psychological suffering , but believes that assisted dying / suicide and voluntary euthanasia are not acceptable means of achieving these laudable goals .
" in *num* , george carey , a former archbishop of canterbury , announced that he had changed his stance on euthanasia and now advocated legalising " assisted dying " .
on embryonic stem-cell research , the church has announced " cautious acceptance to the proposal to produce cytoplasmic hybrid embryos for research " .
the church of england set up the church urban fund in the 1980s to tackle poverty and deprivation .
they see poverty as trapping individuals and communities with some people in urgent need .
this leads to dependency , homelessness , hunger , isolation , low income , mental health problems , social exclusion and violence .
they feel that poverty reduces confidence and life expectancy and that people born in poor conditions have difficulty escaping their disadvantaged circumstances .
in parts of liverpool , manchester and newcastle two-thirds of babies are born to poverty and have poorer life chances , also life expectancy *num* years lower than babies born in most fortunate communities .
south shore , blackpool , has lowest life expectancy at *num* years for men .
many prominent people in the church of england have spoken out against poverty and welfare cuts in the united kingdom .
twenty-seven bishops are among *num* christian leaders who signed a letter which urged david cameron to make sure people have enough to eat .
benefit cuts , failures and " punitive sanctions " force thousands of uk citizens to use food banks .
the campaign to end hunger considers this " truly shocking " and called for a national day of fasting on *num* april *num* .
official figures from *num* showed there were *num* million baptised anglicans in england and wales .
due to its status as the established church , in general , anyone may be married , have their children baptised or their funeral in their local parish church , regardless of whether they are baptised or regular churchgoers .
between *num* and *num* , churchgoing in the united kingdom declined steadily .
in the years *num* to *num* , anglican sunday church attendances almost halved , from *num* .
*num* per cent of the population to *num* .
*num* per cent .
by the year *num* , sunday church attendances had declined further to *num* .
*num* per cent of the population .
one study published in *num* suggested that if current trends were to continue , sunday attendances could fall to *num* , *num* in *num* and just *num* , *num* in *num* .
in *num* , the church of england published statistics showing *num* .
*num* million people attending at least one of its services each month , a level maintained since the turn of the millennium ; approximately one million participating each sunday and three million taking part in a church of england service on christmas day or christmas eve .
the church also claimed that *num* % attend sunday worship at least once a year ; more than *num* % attend a wedding in their local church and still more attend a funeral there .
nationally the church of england baptises one child in ten ( *num* ) .
in *num* , the church's statistics showed that *num* .
*num* million people attended a special advent service , *num* .
*num* million attended a christmas service , *num* .
*num* million attended an easter service , and *num* , *num* attended service during an average week .
in *num* , *num* .
*num* million people attended a christmas service , *num* .
*num* million attended an easter service , *num* .
*num* million people attended a service in the church of england each month , an average of *num* , *num* people attended a weekly service , an additional *num* , *num* attended a service for school each week , and an average of *num* , *num* people attended sunday service .
in *num* cathedral statistics showed that a total of *num* , *num* attended a christmas service , an increase of *num* % and overall sunday attendance has risen from *num* in *num* to *num* , *num* in *num* which had increased over the past *num* years .
also in *num* , approximately *num* .
*num* million people were a part of the regular worshiping community , meaning those attending church once a month or more , *num* .
*num* million were reached in the advent campaign , and *num* .
*num* million people attended a christmas service , representing a slight increase .
the church of england has *num* , *num* active ordained clergy and *num* , *num* licensed lay ministers .
in *num* , *num* people were recommended for ordination training , maintaining the level at the turn of the millennium , and *num* new clergy ( *num* women and *num* men ) were ordained .
more than half of those ordained ( *num* men and *num* women ) were appointed to full-time paid ministry .
in *num* , *num* new clergy were ordained , including *num* to paid ministry , and *num* lay readers were admitted to ministry ; and the mode age-range of those recommended for ordination training had remained 40–49 since *num* .
article xix ( ' of the church ' ) of the *num* articles defines the church as follows : the british monarch has the constitutional title of supreme governor of the church of england .
the canon law of the church of england states , " we acknowledge that the queen's most excellent majesty , acting according to the laws of the realm , is the highest power under god in this kingdom , and has supreme authority over all persons in all causes , as well ecclesiastical as civil .
" in practice this power is often exercised through parliament and the prime minister .
the church of ireland and the church in wales separated from the church of england in *num* and *num* respectively and are autonomous churches in the anglican communion ; scotland's national church , the church of scotland , is presbyterian , but the scottish episcopal church is in the anglican communion .
in addition to england , the jurisdiction of the church of england extends to the isle of man , the channel islands and a few parishes in flintshire , monmouthshire , powys and radnorshire in wales which voted to remain with the church of england rather than joining the church in wales .
expatriate congregations on the continent of europe have become the diocese of gibraltar in europe .
the church is structured as follows ( from the lowest level upwards ) : all rectors and vicars are appointed by patrons , who may be private individuals , corporate bodies such as cathedrals , colleges or trusts , or by the bishop or directly by the crown .
no clergy can be instituted and inducted into a parish without swearing the oath of allegiance to her majesty , and taking the oath of canonical obedience " in all things lawful and honest " to the bishop .
usually they are instituted to the benefice by the bishop and then inducted by the archdeacon into the possession of the benefice property—church and parsonage .
curates ( assistant clergy ) are appointed by rectors and vicars , or if priests-in-charge by the bishop after consultation with the patron .
cathedral clergy ( normally a dean and a varying number of residentiary canons who constitute the cathedral chapter ) are appointed either by the crown , the bishop , or by the dean and chapter themselves .
clergy officiate in a diocese either because they hold office as beneficed clergy or are licensed by the bishop when appointed , or simply with permission .
the most senior bishop of the church of england is the archbishop of canterbury , who is the metropolitan of the southern province of england , the province of canterbury .
he has the status of primate of all england .
he is the focus of unity for the worldwide anglican communion of independent national or regional churches .
justin welby has been archbishop of canterbury since the confirmation of his election on *num* february *num* .
the second most senior bishop is the archbishop of york , who is the metropolitan of the northern province of england , the province of york .
for historical reasons ( relating to the time of york's control by the danes ) he is referred to as the primate of england .
john sentamu became archbishop of york in *num* .
the bishop of london , the bishop of durham and the bishop of winchester are ranked in the next three positions .
the process of appointing diocesan bishops is complex , due to historical reasons balancing hierarchy against democracy , and is handled by the crown nominations committee which submits names to the prime minister ( acting on behalf of the crown ) for consideration .
the church of england has a legislative body , the general synod .
synod can create two types of legislation , measures and canons .
measures have to be approved but cannot be amended by the british parliament before receiving the royal assent and becoming part of the law of england .
although it is the established church in england only , its measures must be approved by both houses of parliament including the non-english members .
canons require royal licence and royal assent , but form the law of the church , rather than the law of the land .
another assembly is the convocation of the english clergy , which is older than the general synod and its predecessor the church assembly .
by the *num* synodical government measure almost all of the convocations ' functions were transferred to the general synod .
additionally , there are diocesan synods and deanery synods , which are the governing bodies of the divisions of the church .
of the *num* diocesan archbishops and bishops in the church of england , *num* are permitted to sit in the house of lords .
the archbishops of canterbury and york automatically have seats , as do the bishops of london , durham and winchester .
the remaining *num* seats are filled in order of seniority by consecration .
it may take a diocesan bishop a number of years to reach the house of lords , at which point he becomes a lord spiritual .
the bishop of sodor and man and the bishop of gibraltar in europe are not eligible to sit in the house of lords as their dioceses lie outside the united kingdom .
although they are not part of england or the united kingdom , the church of england is also the established church in the crown dependencies of the isle of man , the bailiwick of jersey and the bailiwick of guernsey .
the isle of man has its own diocese of sodor and man , and the bishop of sodor and man is an ex officio member of the legislative council of the tynwald on the island .
the channel islands are part of the diocese of winchester , and in jersey the dean of jersey is a non-voting member of the states of jersey .
in guernsey the church of england is the established church , although the dean of guernsey is not a member of the states of guernsey .
the archbishop of canterbury , justin welby , has made some effort to prevent complaints of sex abuse cases being covered up .
independent investigators are examining files as far back as the 1950s and welby hopes this independence will prevent any possibility of a cover-up .
the personal files of all church of england clergy since the 1950s are being audited in an effort to ensure no cover-up .
welby emphasised repeatedly that no cover-up would be acceptable .
despite such assurances there is concern that not enough may be done and historic abuse may still sometimes be covered up .
keith porteous wood of the national secular society stated : bishop peter ball was convicted in october *num* on several charges of indecent assault against young adult men .
there are allegations of large-scale earlier cover-ups involving many british establishment figures which prevented ball's earlier prosecution .
there have also been allegations of child sex abuse , for example robert waddington .
a complainant , known only as " joe " , tried for decades to have action taken over sadistic sex abuse which garth moore perpetrated against him in *num* when " joe " was *num* years old .
none of the high ranking clergy who " joe " spoke to recall being told about the abuse , which " joe " considers incredible .
a representative of the solicitors firm representing " joe " said : although an established church , the church of england does not receive any direct government support .
donations comprise its largest source of income , and it also relies heavily on the income from its various historic endowments .
in *num* , the church of england had estimated total outgoings of around £900 million .
the church of england manages an investment portfolio which is worth more than £8 billion .
the church of england supports " a church near you " , an online directory of churches .
a user-edited resource , it currently lists *num* , *num* churches and has *num* , *num* editors in *num* dioceses .
the directory enables parishes to maintain accurate location , contact and event information which is shared with other websites and mobile apps .
in *num* , the directory formed the data backbone of christmas near you and in *num* was used to promote the church's harvest near you initiative .
folklore folklore is the expressive body of culture shared by a particular group of people ; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture , subculture or group .
these include oral traditions such as tales , proverbs and jokes .
they include material culture , ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group .
folklore also includes customary lore , the forms and rituals of celebrations such as christmas and weddings , folk dances and initiation rites .
each one of these , either singly or in combination , is considered a folklore artifact .
just as essential as the form , folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next .
folklore is not something one can typically gain in a formal school curriculum or study in the fine arts .
instead , these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration .
the academic study of folklore is called folklore studies , and it can be explored at undergraduate , graduate and ph .
d .
levels .
to fully understand folklore , it is helpful to clarify its component parts : the terms folk and lore .
it is well-documented that the term was coined in *num* by the englishman william thoms .
he fabricated it to replace the contemporary terminology of " popular antiquities " or " popular literature " .
the second half of the compound word , " lore " , proves easier to define as its meaning has stayed relatively stable over the last two centuries .
coming from old english lār ' instruction , ' and with german and dutch cognates , it is the knowledge and traditions of a particular group , frequently passed along by word of mouth .
the concept of " folk " proves somewhat more elusive .
when thoms first created this term , " folk " applied only to rural , frequently poor and illiterate peasants .
a more modern definition of " folk " is a social group which includes two or more persons with common traits , who express their shared identity through distinctive traditions .
" folk is a flexible concept which can refer to a nation as in american folklore or to a single family .
" this expanded social definition of " folk " supports a broader view of the material , i .
e .
the lore , considered to be " folklore artifacts " .
these now include all " things people make with words ( verbal lore ) , things they make with their hands ( material lore ) , and things they make with their actions ( customary lore ) " .
folklore is no longer circumscribed as being chronologically old or obsolete .
the folklorist studies the traditional artifacts of a social group and how they are transmitted .
transmission is a vital part of the folklore process .
without communicating these beliefs and customs within the group over space and time , they would become cultural shards relegated to cultural archaeologists .
for folklore is also a verb .
these folk artifacts continue to be passed along informally , as a rule anonymously and always in multiple variants .
the folk group is not individualistic , it is community-based and nurtures its lore in community .
" as new groups emerge , new folklore is created… surfers , motorcyclists , " .
in direct contrast to high culture , where any single work of a named artist is protected by copyright law , folklore is a function of shared identity within the social group .
having identified folk artifacts , the professional folklorist strives to understand the significance of these beliefs , customs and objects for the group .
for these cultural units would not be passed along unless they had some continued relevance within the group .
that meaning can however shift and morph .
so halloween of the *ord* century is not the all hallows ' eve of the middle ages , and even gives rise to its own set of urban legends independent of the historical celebration .
the cleansing rituals of orthodox judaism were originally good public health in a land with little water ; now these customs signify identification as an orthodox jew .
compare this to brushing your teeth , also transmitted within a group , which remains a practical hygiene and health issue and does not rise to the level of a group-defining tradition .
for tradition is initially remembered behavior .
once it loses its practical purpose , there is no reason for further transmission unless it has been imbued with meaning beyond the initial practicality of the action .
this meaning is at the core of folkloristics , the study of folklore .
with an increasingly theoretical sophistication of the social sciences , it has become evident that folklore is a naturally occurring and necessary component of any social group , it is indeed all around us .
it does not have to be old or antiquated .
it continues to be created , transmitted and in any group is used to differentiate between " us " and " them " .
folklore began to distinguish itself as an autonomous discipline during the period of romantic nationalism in europe .
a particular figure in this development was johann gottfried von herder , whose writings in the 1770s presented oral traditions as organic processes grounded in locale .
after the german states were invaded by napoleonic france , herder's approach was adopted by many of his fellow germans who systematized the recorded folk traditions and used them in their process of nation building .
this process was enthusiastically embraced by smaller nations like finland , estonia , and hungary , which were seeking political independence from their dominant neighbours .
folklore as a field of study further developed among *ord* century european scholars who were contrasting tradition with the newly developing modernity .
its focus was the oral folklore of the rural peasant populations , which were considered as residue and survivals of the past that continued to exist within the lower strata of society .
the " kinder- und hausmärchen " of the brothers grimm ( first published *num* ) is the best known but by no means only collection of verbal folklore of the european peasantry of that time .
this interest in stories , sayings and songs continued throughout the *ord* century and aligned the fledgling discipline of folkloristics with literature and mythology .
by the turn into the *ord* century the number and sophistication of folklore studies and folklorists had grown both in europe and north america .
whereas european folklorists remained focused on the oral folklore of the homogenous peasant populations in their regions , the american folklorists , led by franz boas and ruth benedict , chose to consider native american cultures in their research , and included the totality of their customs and beliefs as folklore .
this distinction aligned american folkloristics with cultural anthropology and ethnology , using the same techniques of data collection in their field research .
this divided alliance of folkloristics between the humanities in europe and the social sciences in america offers a wealth of theoretical vantage points and research tools to the field of folkloristics as a whole , even as it continues to be a point of discussion within the field itself .
the term " folkloristics " , along with its synonym " folklore studies " , gained currency in the 1950s to distinguish the academic study of traditional culture from the folklore artifacts themselves .
with the passage in *num* of the american folklife preservation act , ( p .
l .
94-201 ) , passed by the u .
s .
congress in conjunction with the bicentennial celebration in *num* , folkloristics in the united states came of age .
"… [ folklife ] means the traditional expressive culture shared within the various groups in the united states : familial , ethnic , occupational , religious , regional ; expressive culture includes a wide range of creative and symbolic forms such as custom , belief , technical skill , language , literature , art , architecture , music , play , dance , drama , ritual , pageantry , handicraft ; these expressions are mainly learned orally , by imitation , or in performance , and are generally maintained without benefit of formal instruction or institutional direction .
" added to the panoply of other legislation designed to protect the natural and cultural heritage of the united states , this law also marks a shift in national awareness .
it gives voice to a growing understanding that cultural diversity is a national strength and a resource worthy of protection .
paradoxically , it is a unifying feature , not something that separates the citizens of a country .
" we no longer view cultural difference as a problem to be solved , but as a tremendous opportunity .
in the diversity of american folklife we find a marketplace teeming with the exchange of traditional forms and cultural ideas , a rich resource for americans " .
this diversity is celebrated annually at the smithsonian folklife festival and many other folklife fests around the country .
the folk of the *ord* century , the social group identified in the original term " folklore " , was characterized by being rural , illiterate and poor .
they were the peasants living in the countryside , in contrast to the urban populace of the cities .
only toward the end of the century did the urban proletariat ( on the coattails of marxist theory ) become included with the rural poor as folk .
the common feature in this expanded definition of folk was their identification as the underclass of society .
moving forward into the *ord* century , in tandem with new thinking in the , folklorists also revised and expanded their concept of the folk group .
by the 1960s it was understood that social groups , i .
e .
folk groups , were all around us ; each individual is enmeshed in a multitude of differing identities and their concomitant social groups .
the first group that each of us is born into is the family , and each family has its own unique family folklore .
as a child grows into an individual , its identities also increase to include age , language , ethnicity , occupation , etc .
each of these cohorts has its own folklore , and as one folklorist points out , this is " not idle speculation… decades of fieldwork have demonstrated conclusively that these groups do have their own folklore .
" in this modern understanding , folklore is a function of shared identity within any social group .
this folklore can include jokes , sayings and expected behavior in multiple variants , always transmitted in an informal manner .
for the most part it will be learned by observation , imitation , repetition or correction by other group members .
this informal knowledge is used to confirm and re-inforce the identity of the group .
it can be used both internally within the group to express their common identity , for example in an initiation ceremony for new members .
or it can be used externally to differentiate the group from outsiders , like a folkdance demonstration at a community festival .
significant to folklorists here is that there are two opposing but equally valid ways to use this in the study of a group : you can start with an identified group in order to explore its folklore , or you can identify folklore items and use them to identify the social group .
beginning in the 1960s , a further expansion of the concept of folk began to unfold in folkloristics .
individual researchers identified folk groups which had previously been overlooked and ignored .
one major example of this is found in an issue of " the journal of american folklore " , published *num* .
this edition is dedicated exclusively to articles on women's folklore , with approaches that were not coming from a man's perspective .
other groups that were highlighted as part of this broadened understanding of the folk group were non-traditional families , occupational groups , and families that pursued production of folk items through multiple generations .
individual folklore artifacts are commonly classified as one of three types : material , verbal or customary lore .
for the most part self-explanatory , these categories include physical objects ( material folklore ) , common sayings , expressions , stories and songs ( verbal folklore ) , and beliefs and ways of doing things ( customary folklore ) .
there is also a fourth major subgenre defined for children's folklore and games ( childlore ) , as the collection and interpretation of this fertile topic is peculiar to school yards and neighborhood streets .
each of these genres and their subtypes is intended to organize and categorize the folklore artifacts ; they provide common vocabulary and consistent labeling for folklorists to communicate with each other .
that said , each artifact is unique ; in fact one of the characteristics of all folklore artifacts is their variation within genres and types .
this is in direct contrast to manufactured goods , where the goal in production is to create products which are identical , and variations are considered mistakes .
it is however just this required variation that makes identification and classification of the defining features a challenge .
and while this classification is essential for the subject area of folkloristics , it remains just labeling , and adds little to an understanding of the traditional development and meaning of the artifacts themselves .
necessary as they are , genre classifications are misleading in their oversimplification of the subject area .
folklore artifacts are never self-contained , they do not stand in isolation but are particulars in the self-representation of a community .
different genres are frequently combined with each other to mark an event .
so a birthday celebration might include a song or formulaic way of greeting the birthday child ( verbal ) , presentation of a cake and wrapped presents ( material ) , as well as customs to honor the individual , such as sitting at the head of the table , and blowing out the candles with a wish .
there might also be special games played at birthday parties which are not generally played at other times .
adding to the complexity of the interpretation , the birthday party for a seven-year-old will not be identical to the birthday party for that same child as a six-year-old , even though they follow the same model .
for each artifact embodies a single variant of a performance in a given time and space .
the task of the folklorist becomes to identify within this surfeit of variables the constants and the expressed meaning that shimmer through all variations : honoring of the individual within the circle of family and friends , gifting to express their value and worth to the group , and of course , the festival food and drink as signifiers of the event .
the formal definition of verbal lore is words , both written and oral , which are " spoken , sung , voiced forms of traditional utterance that show repetitive patterns .
" crucial here are the repetitive patterns .
verbal lore is not just any conversation , but words and phrases conforming to a traditional configuration recognized by both the speaker and the audience .
for narrative types by definition have consistent structure , and follow an existing model in their narrative form .
as just one simple example , in english the phrase " an elephant walks into a bar… " instantaneously flags the following text as a joke .
it might be one you've already heard , but it might be one that the speaker has just thought up within the current context .
this is folklore in action .
another example is the child's song old macdonald had a farm , where each performance is distinctive in the animals named , their order and their sounds .
songs such as this are used to express cultural values ( farms are important , farmers are old and weather-beaten ) and teach children about different domesticated animals .
this is folklore in action .
verbal folklore was the original folklore , the artifacts defined by william thoms as older , oral cultural traditions of the rural populace .
in his *num* published call for help in documenting antiquities , thoms was echoing scholars from across the european continent to collect artifacts of verbal lore .
by the beginning of the *ord* century these collections had grown to include artifacts from around the world and across several centuries .
a system to organize and categorize them became necessary .
antti aarne published a first classification system for folktales in *num* .
this was later expanded into the aarne–thompson classification system by stith thompson and remains the standard classification system for european folktales and other types of oral literature .
as the number of classified oral artifacts grew , similarities were noted in items which had been collected from very different geographic regions , ethnic groups and epochs , giving rise to the historic–geographic method , a methodology which dominated folkloristics in the first half of the *ord* century .
when william thoms first published his appeal to document the verbal lore of the rural populations , it was believed these folk artifacts would die out as the population became literate .
over the past two centuries this belief has proven to be wrong ; folklorists continue to collect verbal lore in both written and spoken form from all social groups .
some variants might have been captured in published collections , but much of it is still transmitted orally and indeed continues to be generated in new forms and variants at an alarming rate .
below is listed a small sampling of types and examples of verbal lore .
the genre of material culture includes all artifacts that you can touch , hold , live in or eat .
they are tangible objects , with a physical presence intended for use either permanently or just at the next meal .
most of these folklore artifacts are single objects which have been created by hand for a specific purpose .
however folk artifacts can also be mass-produced , such as dreidels or christmas decorations .
these items continue to be considered folklore due to their long ( pre-industrial ) history and their customary use .
all of these material objects " existed prior to and continue alongside mechanized industry .
… [ they are ] transmitted across the generations and subject to the same forces of conservative tradition and individual variation " that are found in all folk artifacts .
of interest to folklorists are their physical form , their method of manufacture or construction , their pattern of use as well as the procurement of the raw materials .
the meaning to those who both make and use these objects is important .
of primary significance in these studies is the complex balance of continuity over change in both their design and their decoration .
in europe before the industrial revolution everything was made by hand .
while some folklorists of the *ord* century wanted to secure the oral traditions of the rural folk before the populace became literate , other folklorists sought to identify hand-crafted objects before their production processes were lost to industrial manufacturing .
just as verbal lore continues to be actively created and transmitted in today's culture , so these handicrafts , possibly with a shift in purpose and meaning , can still be found all around us .
for there are many reasons to continue to hand make objects for use .
it could mean these skills are needed to repair manufactured items .
or perhaps a unique design is wanted which is not ( or cannot be ) found in the stores .
many crafts are considered to be simple home maintenance , such as cooking , sewing and carpentry .
handicrafts have also become for many an enjoyable and satisfying hobby .
last but not least , handmade objects have taken on the sheen of prestige , where extra time and thought is spent in their creation and their uniqueness is valued .
for the folklorist , these hand-crafted objects embody multifaceted relationships in the lives of the craftsmen and the users , which is completely lacking in mass-produced items without connection to an individual craftsman .
regardless of the motivation for the handicraft , this is folklore in action .
many traditional crafts have been elevated to the fine or applied arts and taught in art schools , such as ironworking and glass-making .
or they are repurposed as folk art , characterized as objects in which the decorative form supersedes its utilitarian needs .
folk art is found in hex signs on pennsylvania dutch barns , tin man sculptures made by metalworkers , front yard christmas displays , decorated school lockers , carved gun stocks , and tattoos .
" words such as naive , self-taught , and individualistic are used to describe these objects , and the exceptional rather than the representative creation is featured .
" this is in contrast to our understanding of folklore artifacts which are nurtured and passed along in community .
many objects of material folklore , big and small , are challenging to classify , difficult to archive and unwieldy to store .
how do we preserve these bulky artifacts of material culture , and how do we use them ? that is the assigned task of museums .
toward this goal the concept of the living history or open-air museum has been developed , beginning in scandinavia at the end of the *ord* century .
these museums are here to teach , not just display .
actors show how items were used , reenacting everyday living by people from all segments of society .
in order to achieve this , these museums rely heavily on the material artifacts of a pre-industrial society .
many locations even duplicate the processing of the objects , thus creating new objects of an earlier historic time period .
these living history museums are now found throughout the united states and the world as part of a thriving heritage industry .
this is folklore in action .
this list represents just a small sampling of objects and skills which are included in studies of material culture .
customary culture is remembered enactment , i .
e .
re-enactment .
it is the patterns of expected behavior within a group , the " traditional and expected way of doing things " a custom can be a single gesture , such as thumbs down or a handshake .
it can also be a complex interaction of multiple folk customs and artifacts as seen in a child's birthday party , including verbal lore ( happy birthday song ) , material lore ( presents and a birthday cake ) , special games ( musical chairs ) and individual customs ( making a wish as you blow out the candles ) .
each of these is a folklore artifact in its own right , potentially worthy of investigation and cultural analysis .
together they combine to build the custom of a birthday party celebration , a scripted combination of multiple artifacts which have meaning within their social group .
folklorists divide customs into several different categories .
a custom can be a seasonal celebration , such as thanksgiving or new year's .
it can be a life cycle celebration for an individual , such as baptism , birthday or wedding .
a custom can also mark a community festival or event ; examples of this are carnival in cologne or mardi gras in new orleans .
this category also includes the smithsonian folklife festival celebrated each summer on the mall in washington , dc .
a fourth category includes customs related to folk beliefs .
walking under a ladder is just one of many symbols considered unlucky .
occupational groups tend to have a rich history of customs related to their life and work , so the traditions of sailors or lumberjacks .
the area of ecclesiastical folklore , which includes modes of worship not sanctioned by the established church tends to be so large and complex that it is usually treated as a specialized area of folk customs ; it requires considerable expertise in standard church ritual in order to adequately interpret folk customs and beliefs that originated in official church practice .
customary folklore is by definition folklore in action ; it is always a performance , be it a single gesture or a complex of scripted customs .
participating in the custom , either as performer or audience , signifies acknowledgment of that social group .
some customary behavior is intended to be performed and understood only within the group itself , so the handkerchief code sometimes used in the gay community or the initiation rituals of the freemasons .
other customs are designed specifically to represent a social group to outsiders , those who do not belong to this group .
the st .
patrick's day parade in new york and in other communities across the continent is a single example of an ethnic group parading their separateness ( differential behavior ) , and encouraging americans of all stripes to show alliance to this colorful ethnic group .
another multicolored social group , the gay pride movement , also parades in communities across the country to show the strength of their culture and demonstrate for recognition of their group within the contemporary legal and social systems .
these festivals and parades , with a target audience of people who do not belong to the social group , intersect with the interests and mission of public folklorists , who are engaged in the documentation , preservation , and presentation of traditional forms of folklife .
with a swell in popular interest in folk traditions , these community celebrations are becoming more numerous throughout the western world .
while ostensibly parading the diversity of their community , economic groups have discovered that these folk parades and festivals are good for business .
all shades of people are out on the streets , eating , drinking and spending .
this attracts support not only from the business community , but also from federal and state organizations for these local street parties .
paradoxically , in parading diversity within the community , these events have come to authenticate true community , where business interests ally with the varied ( folk ) social groups to promote the interests of the community as a whole .
this is just a small sampling of types and examples of customary lore .
childlore is a distinct branch of folklore that deals with activities passed on by children to other children , away from the influence or supervision of an adult .
children's folklore contains artifacts from all the standard folklore genres of verbal , material and customary lore ; it is however the child-to-child conduit that distinguishes these artifacts .
for childhood is a social group where children teach , learn and share their own traditions , flourishing in a street culture outside the purview of adults .
this is also ideally where it needs to be collected ; as iona and peter opie demonstrated in their pioneering book " children's games in street and playground " .
here the social group of children is studied on its own terms , not as an derivative of adult social groups .
it is shown that the culture of children is quite distinctive ; it is generally unnoticed by the sophisticated world of adults , and quite as little affected by it .
of particular interest to folklorists here is the mode of transmission of these artifacts ; this lore circulates exclusively within an informal pre-literate children's network or folkgroup .
it does not include artifacts taught to children by adults .
however children can take the taught and teach it further to other children , turning it into childlore .
or they can take the artifacts and turn them into something else ; so old mcdonald's farm is transformed from animal noises to the scatological version of animal poop .
this childlore is characterized by " its lack of dependence on literary and fixed form .
children…operate among themselves in a world of informal and oral communication , unimpeded by the necessity of maintaining and transmitting information by written means .
this is as close as folklorists can come to observing the transmission and social function of this folk knowledge before the spread of literacy during the *ord* century .
as we have seen with the other genres , the original collections of children's lore and games in the *ord* century was driven by a fear that the culture of childhood would die out .
early folklorists , among them alice gomme in britain and william wells newell in the united states , felt a need to capture the unstructured and unsupervised street life and activities of children before it was lost .
this fear proved to be unfounded .
in a comparison of any modern school playground during recess and the painting of " children's games " by pieter breugel the elder we can see that the activity level is similar , and many of the games from the *num* painting are recognizable and comparable to modern variations still played today .
these same artifacts of childlore , in innumerable variations , also continue to serve the same function of learning and practicing skills needed for growth .
so bouncing and swinging rhythms and rhymes encourage development of balance and coordination in infants and children .
verbal rhymes like peter piper picked .
.
.
serve to increase both the oral and aural acuity of children .
songs and chants , accessing a different part of the brain , are used to memorize series ( alphabet song ) .
they also provide the necessary beat to complex physical rhythms and movements , be it hand-clapping , jump roping , or ball bouncing .
furthermore , many physical games are used to develop strength , coordination and endurance of the players .
for some team games , negotiations about the rules can run on longer than the game itself as social skills are rehearsed .
even as we are just now uncovering the neuroscience that undergirds the developmental function of this childlore , the artifacts themselves have been in play for centuries .
below is listed just a small sampling of types and examples of childlore and games .
a strong case has been made for considering folk history as a distinct sub-category of folklore , which has received attention from such folklorists as richard dorson and has found a journal in " the folklore historian " , sponsored by the history and folklore section of the american folklore society .
the study of folk history has been particularly developed in ireland , where the " handbook of irish folklore " ( the standard book used by all field workers of the irish folklore commission ) recognized " historical tradition " as a separate category , traditionally referred to as " seanchas " .
henry glassie , in his classic study " passing the time in ballymenone " , made a pioneering contribution .
.
more than anybody else , guy beiner has presented in-depth studies of irish folk history .
beiner has identified a number of characteristic genres for what he has named " history telling " , such as stories ( divided into tales and “mini-histories” ) , songs and ballads ( especially rebel songs ) , poems , rhymes , toasts , prophecies , proverbs and sayings , place-names , and a variety of commemorative ritual practices .
these are often recited by specially-dedicated storytellers ( " seanchaithe " ) and folk-historians ( " staireolaithe " ) .
beiner has since adopted the term " vernacular historiography " in order to move beyond the confines of " the artificial divides between oral and literary cultures that lie at the heart of conceptualizations of oral tradition " .
lacking context , the folklore artifacts in the smithsonian folklife archive contain as much life as the stuffed elephant down the street in the natural history museum .
it is only in performance that they come alive as an active and meaningful component of a social group ; this is where the intergroup communication lives , where transmission of these cultural elements takes place .
" folklore is folklore only when performed " .
without transmission , these items are not folklore , they are just individual quirky tales and objects .
this understanding in folkloristics only occurred in the second half of the *ord* century , when the two terms " folklore performance " and " text and context " dominated discussions among folklorists .
these terms are not contradictory or even mutually exclusive .
as borrowings from other fields of study , one or the other linguistic formulation is more appropriate to any given discussion .
performance is frequently tied to verbal and customary lore , whereas context is used in discussions of material lore .
both formulations offer different perspectives on the same folkloric understanding , specifically that folklore artifacts need to remain embedded in their cultural environment if we are to gain insight into their meaning for the community .
the concept of cultural ( folklore ) performance is shared with ethnography and anthropology among other social sciences .
the cultural anthropologist victor turner identified four universal characteristics of cultural performance .
these are playfulness , framing , using symbolic language and employing the subjunctive mood .
in performance the audience leaves the daily reality to move into a mode of make-believe , " what if " .
that this fits well with all types of verbal lore , where reality finds no footing among the symbols , fantasies , and nonsense of traditional tales , proverbs , and jokes is self-evident .
customs and the lore of children and games also fit easily into the language of a folklore performance .
material culture requires some kneading to turn it into a performance .
should we consider the performance of the production , as in a quilting party , or the performance of the recipients who use the quilt to cover their marriage bed ? here the language of context works better to describe the quilting of patterns copied from the grandmother , quilting as a social event during the winter months , or the gifting of a quilt to signify the importance of the event .
each of these , the traditional pattern chosen , the social event and the gifting occur within the broader context of the community .
that said , even in a discussion of context the structure and characteristics of performance can be recognized , including an audience , a framing event , and the use of decorative figures and symbols which go beyond the utility of the object .
before the second world war , folk artifacts had been understood and collected as cultural shards of an earlier time .
they were considered individual vestigial artifacts , with little or no function in the contemporary culture .
given this understanding , the goal of the folklorist was to capture and document them before they disappeared .
they were collected with no supporting data , bound in books , archived and classified more or less successfully .
the historic–geographic method worked to isolate and track these collected artifacts , mostly verbal lore , across space and time .
following the second world war , folklorists began to articulate a more holistic approach toward their subject matter .
in tandem with the growing sophistication in the , attention was no longer limited to the isolated artifact , but extended to include the artifact embedded in an active cultural environment .
one early proponent was alan dundes with his essay " texture , text and context " , first published *num* .
a public presentation in *num* by dan ben-amos at the american folklore society brought the behavioral approach into open debate among folklorists .
in *num* richard dorson called out the " young turks " for their movement toward a behavioral approach to folklore .
this approach " shifted the conceptualization of folklore as an extractable item or ' text ' to an emphasis on folklore as a kind of human behavior and communication .
conceptualizing folklore as behavior redefined the job of folklorists .
.
.
" folklore became a verb , an action , something that people do , not just something that they have .
it is in the performance and the active context that folklore artifacts get transmitted in informal , direct communication , either verbally or in demonstration .
performance became the umbrella term for all the different modes and manners in which this transmission occurs .
transmission is a communicative process requiring a binary : one individual or group who actively transmits information in some form to another individual or group .
each of these is a defined role in the folklore process .
the tradition-bearer is the individual who actively passes along the knowledge of an artifact ; this can be either a mother singing a lullaby to her baby , or an irish dance troupe performing at a local festival .
they are named individuals , usually well known in the community as knowledgeable in their traditional lore .
they are not the anonymous " folk " , the nameless mass without of history or individuality .
the audience of this performance is the other half in the transmission process ; they listen , watch , and remember .
few of them will become active tradition-bearers ; many more will be passive tradition-bearers who maintain a memory of this specific traditional artifact , in both its presentation and its content .
there is active communication between the audience and the performer .
the performer is presenting to the audience ; the audience in turn , through its actions and reactions , is actively communicating with the performer .
the purpose of this performance is not to create something new but to re-create something that already exists ; the performance is words and actions which are known , recognized and valued by both the performer and the audience .
for folklore is first and foremost remembered behavior .
as members of the same cultural reference group , they identify and value this performance as a piece of shared cultural knowledge .
to initiate the performance , there must be a frame of some sort to indicate that what is to follow is indeed performance .
the frame brackets it as outside of normal discourse .
in customary lore such as life cycle celebrations ( ex .
birthday ) or dance performances , the framing occurs as part of the event , frequently marked by location .
the audience goes to the event location to participate .
games are defined primarily by rules , it is with the initiation of the rules that the game is framed .
the folklorist barre toelken describes an evening spent in a navaho family playing string figure games , with each of the members shifting from performer to audience as they create and display different figures to each other .
in verbal lore , the performer will start and end with recognized linguistic formulas .
an easy example is seen in the common introduction to a joke : " have you heard the one .
.
.
" , " joke of the day .
.
.
" , or " an elephant walks into a bar " .
each of these signals to the listeners that the following is a joke , not to be taken literally .
the joke is completed with the punch line of the joke .
another traditional narrative marker in english is the framing of a fairy tale between the phrases " once upon a time " and " they all lived happily ever after .
" many languages have similar phrases which are used to frame a traditional tale .
each of these linguistic formulas removes the bracketed text from ordinary discourse , and marks it as a recognized form of stylized , formulaic communication for both the performer and the audience .
framing as a narrative device serves to signal to both the story teller and the audience that the narrative which follows is indeed a fiction ( verbal lore ) , and not to be understood as historical fact or reality .
it moves the framed narration into the subjunctive mood , and marks a space in which " fiction , history , story , tradition , art , teaching , all exist within the narrated or performed expressive ' event ' outside the normal realms and constraints of reality or time .
" this shift from the realis to the irrealis mood is understood by all participants within the reference group .
it enables these fictional events to contain meaning for the group , and can lead to very real consequences .
the theory of self-correction in folklore transmission was first articulated by the folklorist walter anderson in the 1920s ; this posits a feedback mechanism which would keep folklore variants closer to the original form .
this theory addresses the question about how , with multiple performers and multiple audiences , the artifact maintains its identity across time and geography .
anderson credited the audience with censoring narrators who deviated too far from the known ( traditional ) text .
any performance is a two-way communication process .
the performer addresses the audience with words and actions ; the audience in turn actively responds to the performer .
if this performance deviates too far from audience expectations of the familiar folk artifact , they will respond with negative feedback .
wanting to avoid more negative reaction , the performer will adjust his performance to conform to audience expectations .
" social reward by an audience [ is ] a major factor in motivating narrators .
.
.
" it is this dynamic feedback loop between performer and audience which gives stability to the text of the performance .
in reality , this model is not so simplistic ; there is multiple redundancy in the active folklore process .
the performer has heard the tale multiple times , he has heard it from different story tellers in multiple versions .
in turn , he tells the tale multiple times to the same or a different audience , and they expect to hear the version they know .
this expanded model of redundancy in a non-linear narrative process makes it difficult to innovate during any single performance ; corrective feedback from the audience will be immediate .
" at the heart of both autopoetic self-maintenance and the ' virality ' of meme transmission .
.
.
it is enough to assume that some sort of recursive action maintains a degree of integrity [ of the artifact ] in certain features .
.
.
sufficient to allow us to recognize it as an instance of its type .
" for material folk artifacts , it becomes more fruitful to return to the terminology of alan dundes : text and context .
here the text designates the physical artifact itself , the single item made by an individual for a specific purpose .
the context is then unmasked by observation and questions concerning both its production and its usage .
why was it made , how was it made , who will use it , how will they use it , where did the raw materials come from , who designed it , etc .
these questions are limited only by the skill of the interviewer .
in his study of southeastern kentucky chair makers , michael owen jones describes production of a chair within the context of the life of the craftsman .
for henry glassie in his study of folk housing in middle virginia the investigation concerns the historical pattern he finds repeated in the dwellings of this region : the house is planted in the landscape just as the landscape completes itself with the house .
the artisan in his roadside stand or shop in the nearby town wants to make and display products which appeal to customers .
there is " a craftsperson's eagerness to produce ' satisfactory items ' due to a close personal contact with the customer and expectations to serve the customer again .
" here the role of consumer " .
.
.
is the basic force responsible for the continuity and discontinuity of behavior .
" in material culture the context becomes the cultural environment in which the object is made ( chair ) , used ( house ) , and sold ( wares ) .
none of these artisans is " anonymous " folk ; they are individuals making a living with the tools and skills learned within and valued in the context of their community .
no two performances are identical .
the performer attempts to keep the performance within expectations , but this happens despite a multitude of changing variables .
he has given this performance one time more or less , the audience is different , the social and political environment has changed .
in the context of material culture , no two hand-crafted items are identical .
sometimes these deviations in the performance and the production are unintentional , just part of the process .
but sometimes these deviations are intentional ; the performer or artisan want to play with the boundaries of expectation and add their own creative touch .
they perform within the tension of conserving the recognized form and adding innovation .
the folklorist barre toelken identifies this tension as " .
.
.
a combination of both changing ( " dynamic " ) and static ( " conservative " ) elements that evolve and change through sharing , communication and performance .
" over time , the cultural context shifts and morphs : new leaders , new technologies , new values , new awareness .
as the context changes , so must the artifact , for without modifications to map existing artifacts into the evolving cultural landscape , they lose their meaning .
joking as an active form of verbal lore makes this tension visible as joke cycles come and go to reflect new issues of concern .
once an artifact is no longer applicable to the context , transmission becomes a nonstarter ; it loses relevancy for a contemporary audience .
if it is not transmitted , then it is no longer folklore and becomes instead an historic relic .
it is too soon to identify how the advent of electronic communications will modify and change the performance and transmission of folklore artifacts .
just by looking at the development of one type of verbal lore , electronic joking , it is clear that the internet is modifying folkloric process , not killing it .
jokes and joking are as plentiful as ever both in traditional face-to-face interactions and through electronic transmission .
new communication modes are also transforming traditional stories into many different configurations .
the fairy tale snow white is now offered in multiple media forms for both children and adults , including a television show and video game .
a more generalized analysis of folklore in the electronic age will have to wait for further studies to be published in the field .
chelsea f .

chelsea football club is a professional football club based in london , england , that competes in the premier league , the highest tier of english football .
the club has won eight league titles , eight fa cups , five league cups , four fa community shields , two uefa cup winners ' cups , one uefa champions league , one uefa europa league , and one uefa super cup .
founded in *num* , the club's home ground since then has been stamford bridge .
chelsea won its only first division title in *num* , but saw limited success in various cup competitions until *num* , when the club was purchased by russian billionaire roman abramovich .
chelsea then saw heavy investment , and have since won eighteen honours under abramovich .
josé mourinho is the club's most successful manager in terms of the number of major honours won , and his title-winning team set an english record for points between *num* and *num* .
chelsea have traditionally wore a royal blue kit with white socks , and the club's crest features a ceremonial lion rampant regardant holding a staff .
the club have rivalries with neighbouring clubs fulham , arsenal , and tottenham hotspur .
in terms of club value , chelsea are the seventh most valuable football club in the world , worth £1 .
*num* billion ( $2 .
*num* billion ) , and are the eighth highest-earning football club in the world , with earnings of over €428 million in the 2017–18 season .
based on attendance figures , the club have the sixth-largest fanbase in england .
in *num* , gus mears acquired the stamford bridge athletics stadium with the aim of turning it into a football ground .
an offer to lease it to nearby fulham was turned down , so mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium .
as there was already a team named fulham in the borough , the name of the adjacent borough of chelsea was chosen for the new club ; names like " kensington fc " , " stamford bridge fc " and " london fc " were also considered .
chelsea were founded on *num* march *num* at the rising sun pub ( now the butcher's hook ) , opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on fulham road , and were elected to the football league shortly afterwards .
the club won promotion to the first division in their second season , and yo-yoed between the first and second divisions in their early years .
they reached the *num* fa cup final , where they lost to sheffield united at old trafford , and finished third in the first division in *num* , the club's best league campaign to that point .
chelsea attracted large crowds and had a reputation for signing big-name players , but success continued to elude the club in the inter-war years .
former arsenal and england centre-forward ted drake became manager in *num* and proceeded to modernise the club .
he removed the club's chelsea pensioner crest , improved the youth set-up and training regime , rebuilt the side with shrewd signings from the lower divisions and amateur leagues , and led chelsea to their first major trophy success – the league championship – in 1954–55 .
the following season saw uefa create the european champions ' cup , but after objections from the football league and the fa chelsea were persuaded to withdraw from the competition before it started .
chelsea failed to build on this success , and spent the remainder of the 1950s in mid-table .
drake was dismissed in *num* and replaced by player-coach tommy docherty .
docherty built a new team around the group of talented young players emerging from the club's youth set-up and chelsea challenged for honours throughout the 1960s , enduring several near-misses .
they were on course for a treble of league , fa cup and league cup going into the final stages of the 1964–65 season , winning the league cup but faltering late on in the other two .
in three seasons the side were beaten in three major semi-finals and were fa cup runners-up .
under docherty's successor , dave sexton , chelsea won the fa cup in *num* , beating leeds united 2–1 in a final replay .
chelsea took their first european honour , a uefa cup winners ' cup triumph , the following year , with another replayed win , this time over real madrid in athens .
the late 1970s through to the ' 80s was a turbulent period for chelsea .
an ambitious redevelopment of stamford bridge threatened the financial stability of the club , star players were sold and the team were relegated .
further problems were caused by a notorious hooligan element among the support , which was to plague the club throughout the decade .
in *num* , chelsea were , at the nadir of their fortunes , acquired by ken bates for the nominal sum of £1 , although by now the stamford bridge freehold had been sold to property developers , meaning the club faced losing their home .
on the pitch , the team had fared little better , coming close to relegation to the third division for the first time , but in *num* manager john neal put together an impressive new team for minimal outlay .
chelsea won the second division title in 1983–84 and established themselves in the top division , before being relegated again in *num* .
the club bounced back immediately by winning the second division championship in 1988–89 .
after a long-running legal battle , bates reunited the stadium freehold with the club in *num* by doing a deal with the banks of the property developers , who had been bankrupted by a market crash .
chelsea's form in the new premier league was unconvincing , although they did reach the *num* fa cup final with glenn hoddle .
it was not until the appointment of ruud gullit as player-manager in *num* that their fortunes changed .
he added several top international players to the side , as the club won the fa cup in *num* and established themselves as one of england's top sides again .
gullit was replaced by gianluca vialli , who led the team to victory in the league cup final , the uefa cup winners ' cup final and the uefa super cup in *num* , the fa cup in *num* and their first appearance in the uefa champions league .
vialli was sacked in favour of claudio ranieri , who guided chelsea to the *num* fa cup final and champions league qualification in 2002–03 .
in july *num* , bates sold chelsea to russian billionaire roman abramovich for £140 million .
over £100 million was spent on new players , but ranieri was unable to deliver any trophies , and was replaced by josé mourinho .
under mourinho , chelsea became the fifth english team to win back-to-back league championships since the second world war ( 2004–05 and 2005–06 ) , in addition to winning an fa cup ( *num* ) and two league cups ( *num* and *num* ) .
after a poor start to the 2007–2008 season , mourinho was replaced by avram grant , who led the club to their first uefa champions league final , which they lost on penalties to manchester united .
luiz felipe scolari took over from grant , but was sacked after *num* months following poor results .
guus hiddink then took over the club on an interim basis while continuing to manage the russian national football team .
hiddink guided chelsea to another fa cup success , after which he left the club to return full-time to the russian managerial position .
in 2009–10 , his successor carlo ancelotti led them to their first premier league and fa cup double " , the team becoming the first english top-flight club to score *num* league goals in a season since *num* .
in *num* , caretaker manager roberto di matteo led chelsea to their seventh fa cup , and their first uefa champions league title , beating bayern munich 4–3 on penalties , the first london club to win the trophy .
in *num* , interim manager rafael benítez guided chelsea to win the uefa europa league against benfica , helping them become the first club to hold two major european titles simultaneously and one of five clubs , and the first british club followed by manchester united , to have won all three of uefa's major club competitions .
in the summer of *num* , mourinho returned as manager , leading chelsea to league cup success in march *num* , and their fifth league title two months later .
mourinho was removed after four months of the following season , with the club having lost *num* of their first *num* games and sitting only one point above the relegation zone .
two years later , under new coach antonio conte , chelsea won its sixth english title .
chelsea have only had one home ground , stamford bridge , where they have played since the team's foundation .
it was officially opened on *num* april *num* and for the first *num* years of its existence it was used almost exclusively by the london athletic club as an arena for athletics meetings and not at all for football .
in *num* the ground was acquired by businessman gus mears and his brother joseph , who had also purchased nearby land ( formerly a large market garden ) with the aim of staging football matches on the now *num* .
*num* acre ( *num* , *num* m² ) site .
stamford bridge was designed for the mears family by the noted football architect archibald leitch , who had also designed ibrox , craven cottage and hampden park .
most football clubs were founded first , and then sought grounds in which to play , but chelsea were founded for stamford bridge .
starting with an open bowl-like design and one covered terrace , stamford bridge had an original capacity of around *num* , *num* .
the early 1930s saw the construction of a terrace on the southern part of the ground with a roof that covered around one fifth of the stand .
it eventually became known as the " shed end " , the home of chelsea's most loyal and vocal supporters , particularly during the 1960s , 70s and 80s .
the exact origins of the name are unclear , but the fact that the roof looked like a corrugated iron shed roof played a part .
in the early 1970s , the club's owners announced a modernisation of stamford bridge with plans for a state-of-the-art *num* , *num* all-seater stadium .
work began on the east stand in *num* but the project was beset with problems and was never completed ; the cost brought the club close to bankruptcy , culminating in the freehold being sold to property developers .
following a long legal battle , it was not until the mid-1990s that chelsea's future at the stadium was secured and renovation work resumed .
the north , west and southern parts of the ground were converted into all-seater stands and moved closer to the pitch , a process completed by *num* .
when stamford bridge was redeveloped in the bates era many additional features were added to the complex including two hotels , apartments , bars , restaurants , the chelsea megastore , and an interactive visitor attraction called chelsea world of sport .
the intention was that these facilities would provide extra revenue to support the football side of the business , but they were less successful than hoped and before the abramovich takeover in *num* the debt taken on to finance them was a major burden on the club .
soon after the takeover a decision was taken to drop the " chelsea village " brand and refocus on chelsea as a football club .
however , the stadium is sometimes still referred to as part of " "chelsea village" " or " "the village" " .
the stamford bridge freehold , the pitch , the turnstiles and chelsea's naming rights are now owned by chelsea pitch owners , a non-profit organisation in which fans are the shareholders .
the cpo was created to ensure the stadium could never again be sold to developers .
as a condition for using the chelsea fc name , the club has to play its first team matches at stamford bridge , which means that if the club moves to a new stadium , they may have to change their name .
chelsea's training ground is located in cobham , surrey .
chelsea moved to cobham in *num* .
their previous training ground in harlington was taken over by qpr in *num* .
the new training facilities in cobham were completed in *num* .
stamford bridge has been used for a variety of other sporting events since *num* .
it hosted the fa cup final from *num* to *num* , has held ten fa cup semi-finals ( most recently in *num* ) , ten fa charity shield matches ( the last in *num* ) , and three england international matches , the last in *num* ; it was also the venue for an unofficial " victory international " in *num* .
the *num* uefa women's champions league final was played at stamford bridge .
in october *num* it hosted a rugby union match between the all blacks and middlesex , and in *num* hosted a baseball match between the touring new york giants and the chicago white sox .
it was the venue for a boxing match between world flyweight champion jimmy wilde and joe conn in *num* .
the running track was used for dirt track racing between *num* and *num* , greyhound racing from *num* to *num* , and midget car racing in *num* .
in *num* , stamford bridge hosted the first international floodlit cricket match in the uk , between essex and the west indies .
it was also the home stadium of the london monarchs american football team for the *num* season .
the current club ownership have stated that a larger stadium is necessary in order for chelsea to stay competitive with rival clubs who have significantly larger stadia , such as arsenal and manchester united .
owing to its location next to a main road and two railway lines , fans can only enter the ground via the fulham road exits , which places constraints on expansion due to health and safety regulations .
the club have consistently affirmed their desire to keep chelsea at their current home , but have nonetheless been linked with a move to various nearby sites , including the earls court exhibition centre , battersea power station and the chelsea barracks .
in october *num* , a proposal from the club to buy back the freehold to the land on which stamford bridge sits was voted down by chelsea pitch owners shareholders .
in may *num* , the club made a formal bid to purchase battersea power station , with a view to developing the site into a new stadium , but lost out to a malaysian consortium .
the club subsequently announced plans to redevelop stamford bridge into a *num* , 000-seater stadium .
on *num* january *num* it was announced that the stadium was given the go ahead from hammersmith and fulham council for the new *num* , *num* stadium to be built .
however , on *num* may *num* , the club released a statement via their website stating that " chelsea football club announces today that it has put its new stadium project on hold .
no further pre-construction design and planning work will occur .
" the statement went on to elaborate that " the decision was made due to the current unfavourable investment climate .
" chelsea have had four main crests , which all underwent minor variations .
the first , adopted when the club was founded , was the image of a chelsea pensioner , the army veterans who reside at the nearby royal hospital chelsea .
this contributed to the club's original " pensioner " nickname , and remained for the next half-century , though it never appeared on the shirts .
when ted drake became chelsea manager in *num* , he began to modernise the club .
believing the chelsea pensioner crest to be old-fashioned , he insisted that it be replaced .
a stop-gap badge which comprised the initials c .
f .
c .
was adopted for a year .
in *num* , the club crest was changed to an upright blue lion looking backwards and holding a staff .
it was based on elements in the coat of arms of the metropolitan borough of chelsea with the " lion rampant regardant " taken from the arms of then club president viscount chelsea and the staff from the abbots of westminster , former lords of the manor of chelsea .
it also featured three red roses , to represent england , and two footballs .
this was the first chelsea crest to appear on the shirts , in the early 1960s .
in *num* , with ken bates now owner of the club , chelsea's crest was changed again as part of another attempt to modernise and because the old rampant lion badge could not be trademarked .
the new badge featured a more naturalistic non-heraldic lion , in white and not blue , standing over the c .
f .
c .
initials .
this lasted for the next *num* years , with some modifications such as the use of different colours , including red from *num* to *num* , and yellow from *num* until *num* , before the white returned .
with the new ownership of roman abramovich , and the club's centenary approaching , combined with demands from fans for the popular 1950s badge to be restored , it was decided that the crest should be changed again in *num* .
the new crest was officially adopted for the start of the 2005–06 season and marked a return to the older design , used from *num* to *num* , featuring a blue heraldic lion holding a staff .
for the centenary season this was accompanied by the words ' *num* years ' and ' centenary 2005–2006 ' on the top and bottom of the crest respectively .
chelsea have always worn blue shirts , although they originally used the paler eton blue , which was taken from the racing colours of then club president , earl cadogan , and was worn with white shorts and dark blue or black socks .
the light blue shirts were replaced by a royal blue version in around *num* .
in the 1960s chelsea manager tommy docherty changed the kit again , switching to blue shorts ( which have remained ever since ) and white socks , believing it made the club's colours more modern and distinctive , since no other major side used that combination ; this kit was first worn during the 1964–65 season .
since then chelsea have always worn white socks with their home kit apart from a short spell from *num* to *num* , when blue socks were reintroduced .
chelsea's away colours are usually all yellow or all white with blue trim .
more recently , the club have had a number of black or dark blue away kits which alternate every year .
as with most teams , they have also had some more unusual ones .
at docherty's behest , in the *num* fa cup semi-final they wore blue and black stripes , based on inter milan's kit .
in the mid-1970s , the away strip was a red , white and green kit inspired by the hungarian national side of the 1950s .
other memorable away kits include an all jade strip worn from 1986–89 , red and white diamonds from 1990–92 , graphite and tangerine from 1994–96 , and luminous yellow from 2007–08 .
the graphite and tangerine strip often appears in lists of the worst football kits ever .

during the 1970s and 1980s in particular , chelsea supporters were associated with football hooliganism .

this phenomenon , known as child marriage , is prevalent in central america ; in rural areas of guatemala , *num* % of *num* to *num* year-old women married before their *ord* birthday .
once married , young girls are likely to abandon their education and are exposed to domestic and sexual violence .
they are no longer seen as girls ; their husbands , who are often older men , see them as servants .
frequently births are at home .
most of these women are isolated without networks of support .
in most cases , motherhood comes after marriage .
however , due to the fact that these young women ' bodies are not entirely developed , many pregnancies result in high complications and high risks for both the mother and baby , during and after labor .
because there is limited access to health services , women in guatemala choose a different alternative when it comes to the care during and after child delivery .
pregnancies before marriage are on the rise and unmarried women make their decision based on their image more than their safety .
single guatemalan women may choose midwives as their health care provider during pregnancy and delivery to avoid feeling ashamed .
other women know the midwives in the community personally so they opt for a private healthcare provider .
throughout the country , midwives are known as the providers of choice for approximately *num* % of the births even though they are not professionally trained .
this contributes to the increasing infant mortality rate of *num* per *num* , *num* births as reported in some guatemalan communities .
common lisp common lisp ( cl ) is a dialect of the lisp programming language , published in ansi standard document " ansi incits 226-1994 ( r2004 ) " ( formerly " x3 .
226-1994 ( r1999 ) " ) .
the common lisp hyperspec , a hyperlinked html version , has been derived from the ansi common lisp standard .
the common lisp language was developed as a standardized and improved successor of maclisp .
by the early 1980s several groups were already at work on diverse successors to maclisp : lisp machine lisp ( aka zetalisp ) , spice lisp , nil and s-1 lisp .
common lisp sought to unify , standardise , and extend the features of these maclisp dialects .
common lisp is not an implementation , but rather a language specification .
several implementations of the common lisp standard are available , including free and open-source software and proprietary products .
common lisp is a general-purpose , multi-paradigm programming language .
it supports a combination of procedural , functional , and object-oriented programming paradigms .
as a dynamic programming language , it facilitates evolutionary and incremental software development , with iterative compilation into efficient run-time programs .
this incremental development is often done interactively without interrupting the running application .
it also supports optional type annotation and casting , which can be added as necessary at the later profiling and optimization stages , to permit the compiler to generate more efficient code .
for instance , codice_1 can hold an unboxed integer in a range supported by the hardware and implementation , permitting more efficient arithmetic than on big integers or arbitrary precision types .
similarly , the compiler can be told on a per-module or per-function basis which type safety level is wanted , using " optimize " declarations .
common lisp includes clos , an object system that supports multimethods and method combinations .
it is often implemented with a metaobject protocol .
common lisp is extensible through standard features such as " lisp macros " ( code transformations ) and " reader macros " ( input parsers for characters ) .
common lisp provides some backwards compatibility to maclisp and to john mccarthy's original lisp .
this allows older lisp software to be ported to common lisp .
work on common lisp started in *num* after an initiative by arpa manager bob engelmore to develop a single community standard lisp dialect .
much of the initial language design was done via electronic mail .
in *num* , guy l .
steele , jr .
gave the first overview of common lisp at the *num* acm symposium on lisp and functional programming .
the first language documentation was published *num* as common lisp the language , first edition .
a second edition , published in *num* , incorporated many changes to the language , made during the ansi common lisp standardization process .
the final ansi common lisp standard then was published in *num* .
since then no update to the standard has been published .
various extensions and improvements to common lisp ( examples are unicode , concurrency , clos-based io ) have been provided by implementations and libraries ( many available via quicklisp ) .
common lisp is a dialect of lisp .
it uses s-expressions to denote both code and data structure .
function calls , macro forms and special forms are written as lists , with the name of the operator first , as in these examples : common lisp has many data types .
"number " types include integers , ratios , floating-point numbers , and complex numbers .
common lisp uses bignums to represent numerical values of arbitrary size and precision .
the ratio type represents fractions exactly , a facility not available in many languages .
common lisp automatically coerces numeric values among these types as appropriate .
the common lisp " character " type is not limited to ascii characters .
most modern implementations allow unicode characters .
the " symbol " type is common to lisp languages , but largely unknown outside them .
a symbol is a unique , named data object with several parts : name , value , function , property list and package .
of these , " value cell " and " function cell " are the most important .
symbols in lisp are often used similarly to identifiers in other languages : to hold the value of a variable ; however there are many other uses .
normally , when a symbol is evaluated , its value is returned .
some symbols evaluate to themselves , for example all symbols in the keyword package are self-evaluating .
boolean values in common lisp are represented by the self-evaluating symbols t and nil .
common lisp has namespaces for symbols , called ' packages ' .
a number of functions are available for rounding scalar numeric values in various ways .
the function codice_2 rounds the argument to the nearest integer , with halfway cases rounded to the even integer .
the functions codice_3 , codice_4 , and codice_5 round towards zero , down , or up respectively .
all these functions return the discarded fractional part as a secondary value .
for example , codice_6 yields -3 , *num* .
*num* ; codice_7 yields -2 , -0 .
*num* ; codice_8 yields *num* , *num* .
*num* ; and codice_9 yields *num* , -0 .
*num* .
"sequence " types in common lisp include lists , vectors , bit-vectors , and strings .
there are many operations that can work on any sequence type .
as in almost all other lisp dialects , " lists " in common lisp are composed of " conses " , sometimes called " cons cells " or " pairs " .
a cons is a data structure with two slots , called its " car " and " cdr " .
a list is a linked chain of conses or the empty list .
each cons's car refers to a member of the list ( possibly another list ) .
each cons's cdr refers to the next cons—except for the last cons in a list , whose cdr refers to the codice_10 value .
conses can also easily be used to implement trees and other complex data structures ; though it is usually advised to use structure or class instances instead .
it is also possible to create circular data structures with conses .
common lisp supports multidimensional " arrays " , and can dynamically resize " adjustable " arrays if required .
multidimensional arrays can be used for matrix mathematics .
a " vector " is a one-dimensional array .
arrays can carry any type as members ( even mixed types in the same array ) or can be specialized to contain a specific type of members , as in a vector of bits .
usually only a few types are supported .
many implementations can optimize array functions when the array used is type-specialized .
two type-specialized array types are standard : a " string " is a vector of characters , while a " bit-vector " is a vector of bits .
"hash tables " store associations between data objects .
any object may be used as key or value .
hash tables are automatically resized as needed .
"packages " are collections of symbols , used chiefly to separate the parts of a program into namespaces .
a package may " export " some symbols , marking them as part of a public interface .
packages can use other packages .
"structures " , similar in use to c structs and pascal records , represent arbitrary complex data structures with any number and type of fields ( called " slots " ) .
structures allow single-inheritance .
"classes " are similar to structures , but offer more dynamic features and multiple-inheritance .
( see clos ) .
classes have been added late to common lisp and there is some conceptual overlap with structures .
objects created of classes are called " instances " .
a special case are generic functions .
generic functions are both functions and instances .
common lisp supports first-class functions .
for instance , it is possible to write functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as well .
this makes it possible to describe very general operations .
the common lisp library relies heavily on such higher-order functions .
for example , the codice_11 function takes a relational operator as an argument and key function as an optional keyword argument .
this can be used not only to sort any type of data , but also to sort data structures according to a key .
the evaluation model for functions is very simple .
when the evaluator encounters a form codice_12 then it presumes that the symbol named f is one of the following : if f is the name of a function , then the arguments a1 , a2 , .
.
.
, an are evaluated in left-to-right order , and the function is found and invoked with those values supplied as parameters .
the macro codice_14 defines functions where a function definition gives the name of the function , the names of any arguments , and a function body : function definitions may include compiler directives , known as " declarations " , which provide hints to the compiler about optimization settings or the data types of arguments .
they may also include " documentation strings " ( docstrings ) , which the lisp system may use to provide interactive documentation : anonymous functions ( function literals ) are defined using codice_13 expressions , e .
g .
codice_16 for a function that squares its argument .
lisp programming style frequently uses higher-order functions for which it is useful to provide anonymous functions as arguments .
local functions can be defined with codice_17 and codice_18 .
there are a number of other operators related to the definition and manipulation of functions .
for instance , a function may be compiled with the codice_19 operator .
( some lisp systems run functions using an interpreter by default unless instructed to compile ; others compile every function ) .
the macro codice_20 defines generic functions .
generic functions are a collection of methods .
the macro codice_21 defines methods .
methods can specialize their parameters over clos " standard classes " , " system classes " , " structure classes " or objects .
for many types there are corresponding " system classes " .
when a generic function is called , multiple-dispatch will determine the effective method to use .
generic functions are also a first class data type .
there are many more features to generic functions and methods than described above .
the namespace for function names is separate from the namespace for data variables .
this is a key difference between common lisp and scheme .
for common lisp , operators that define names in the function namespace include codice_14 , codice_17 , codice_18 , codice_21 and codice_20 .
to pass a function by name as an argument to another function , one must use the codice_27 special operator , commonly abbreviated as codice_28 .
the first codice_11 example above refers to the function named by the symbol codice_30 in the function namespace , with the code codice_31 .
conversely , to call a function passed in such a way , one would use the codice_32 operator on the argument .
scheme's evaluation model is simpler : there is only one namespace , and all positions in the form are evaluated ( in any order ) -- not just the arguments .
code written in one dialect is therefore sometimes confusing to programmers more experienced in the other .
for instance , many common lisp programmers like to use descriptive variable names such as " list " or " string " which could cause problems in scheme , as they would locally shadow function names .
whether a separate namespace for functions is an advantage is a source of contention in the lisp community .
it is usually referred to as the " lisp-1 vs .
lisp-2 debate " .
lisp-1 refers to scheme's model and lisp-2 refers to common lisp's model .
these names were coined in a *num* paper by richard p .
gabriel and kent pitman , which extensively compares the two approaches .
common lisp supports the concept of " multiple values " , where any expression always has a single " primary value " , but it might also have any number of " secondary values " , which might be received and inspected by interested callers .
this concept is distinct from returning a list value , as the secondary values are fully optional , and passed via a dedicated side channel .
this means that callers may remain entirely unaware of the secondary values being there if they have no need for them , and it makes it convenient to use the mechanism for communicating information that is sometimes useful , but not always necessary .
for example , multiple values are supported by a handful of standard forms , most common of which are the codice_35 special form for accessing secondary values and codice_36 for returning multiple values : other data types in common lisp include : like programs in many other programming languages , common lisp programs make use of names to refer to variables , functions , and many other kinds of entities .
named references are subject to scope .
the association between a name and the entity which the name refers to is called a binding .
scope refers to the set of circumstances in which a name is determined to have a particular binding .
the circumstances which determine scope in common lisp include : to understand what a symbol refers to , the common lisp programmer must know what kind of reference is being expressed , what kind of scope it uses if it is a variable reference ( dynamic versus lexical scope ) , and also the run-time situation : in what environment is the reference resolved , where was the binding introduced into the environment , et cetera .
some environments in lisp are globally pervasive .
for instance , if a new type is defined , it is known everywhere thereafter .
references to that type look it up in this global environment .
one type of environment in common lisp is the dynamic environment .
bindings established in this environment have dynamic extent , which means that a binding is established at the start of the execution of some construct , such as a codice_51 block , and disappears when that construct finishes executing : its lifetime is tied to the dynamic activation and deactivation of a block .
however , a dynamic binding is not just visible within that block ; it is also visible to all functions invoked from that block .
this type of visibility is known as indefinite scope .
bindings which exhibit dynamic extent ( lifetime tied to the activation and deactivation of a block ) and indefinite scope ( visible to all functions which are called from that block ) are said to have dynamic scope .
common lisp has support for dynamically scoped variables , which are also called special variables .
certain other kinds of bindings are necessarily dynamically scoped also , such as restarts and catch tags .
function bindings cannot be dynamically scoped using codice_17 ( which only provides lexically scoped function bindings ) , but function objects ( a first-level object in common lisp ) can be assigned to dynamically scoped variables , bound using codice_51 in dynamic scope , then called using codice_32 or codice_57 .
dynamic scope is extremely useful because it adds referential clarity and discipline to global variables .
global variables are frowned upon in computer science as potential sources of error , because they can give rise to ad-hoc , covert channels of communication among modules that lead to unwanted , surprising interactions .
in common lisp , a special variable which has only a top-level binding behaves just like a global variable in other programming languages .
a new value can be stored into it , and that value simply replaces what is in the top-level binding .
careless replacement of the value of a global variable is at the heart of bugs caused by use of global variables .
however , another way to work with a special variable is to give it a new , local binding within an expression .
this is sometimes referred to as " rebinding " the variable .
binding a dynamically scoped variable temporarily creates a new memory location for that variable , and associates the name with that location .
while that binding is in effect , all references to that variable refer to the new binding ; the previous binding is hidden .
when execution of the binding expression terminates , the temporary memory location is gone , and the old binding is revealed , with the original value intact .
of course , multiple dynamic bindings for the same variable can be nested .
in common lisp implementations which support multithreading , dynamic scopes are specific to each thread of execution .
thus special variables serve as an abstraction for thread local storage .
if one thread rebinds a special variable , this rebinding has no effect on that variable in other threads .
the value stored in a binding can only be retrieved by the thread which created that binding .
if each thread binds some special variable codice_58 , then codice_58 behaves like thread-local storage .
among threads which do not rebind codice_58 , it behaves like an ordinary global : all of these threads refer to the same top-level binding of codice_58 .
dynamic variables can be used to extend the execution context with additional context information which is implicitly passed from function to function without having to appear as an extra function parameter .
this is especially useful when the control transfer has to pass through layers of unrelated code , which simply cannot be extended with extra parameters to pass the additional data .
a situation like this usually calls for a global variable .
that global variable must be saved and restored , so that the scheme doesn't break under recursion : dynamic variable rebinding takes care of this .
and that variable must be made thread-local ( or else a big mutex must be used ) so the scheme doesn't break under threads : dynamic scope implementations can take care of this also .
in the common lisp library , there are many standard special variables .
for instance , all standard i / o streams are stored in the top-level bindings of well-known special variables .
the standard output stream is stored in *standard-output* .
suppose a function foo writes to standard output : to capture its output in a character string , *standard-output* can be bound to a string stream and called : common lisp supports lexical environments .
formally , the bindings in a lexical environment have lexical scope and may have either indefinite extent or dynamic extent , depending on the type of namespace .
lexical scope means that visibility is physically restricted to the block in which the binding is established .
references which are not textually ( i .
e .
lexically ) embedded in that block simply do not see that binding .
the tags in a tagbody have lexical scope .
the expression ( go x ) is erroneous if it is not actually embedded in a tagbody which contains a label x .
however , the label bindings disappear when the tagbody terminates its execution , because they have dynamic extent .
if that block of code is re-entered by the invocation of a lexical closure , it is invalid for the body of that closure to try to transfer control to a tag via go : when the tagbody is executed , it first evaluates the setf form which stores a function in the special variable *stashed* .
then the ( go end-label ) transfers control to end-label , skipping the code ( print " hello " ) .
since end-label is at the end of the tagbody , the tagbody terminates , yielding nil .
suppose that the previously remembered function is now called : this situation is erroneous .
one implementation's response is an error condition containing the message , " go : tagbody for tag some-label has already been left " .
the function tried to evaluate ( go some-label ) , which is lexically embedded in the tagbody , and resolves to the label .
however , the tagbody isn't executing ( its extent has ended ) , and so the control transfer cannot take place .
local function bindings in lisp have lexical scope , and variable bindings also have lexical scope by default .
by contrast with go labels , both of these have indefinite extent .
when a lexical function or variable binding is established , that binding continues to exist for as long as references to it are possible , even after the construct which established that binding has terminated .
references to lexical variables and functions after the termination of their establishing construct are possible thanks to lexical closures .
lexical binding is the default binding mode for common lisp variables .
for an individual symbol , it can be switched to dynamic scope , either by a local declaration , by a global declaration .
the latter may occur implicitly through the use of a construct like defvar or defparameter .
it is an important convention in common lisp programming that special ( i .
e .
dynamically scoped ) variables have names which begin and end with an asterisk sigil codice_62 in what is called the “earmuff convention” .
if adhered to , this convention effectively creates a separate namespace for special variables , so that variables intended to be lexical are not accidentally made special .
lexical scope is useful for several reasons .
firstly , references to variables and functions can be compiled to efficient machine code , because the run-time environment structure is relatively simple .
in many cases it can be optimized to stack storage , so opening and closing lexical scopes has minimal overhead .
even in cases where full closures must be generated , access to the closure's environment is still efficient ; typically each variable becomes an offset into a vector of bindings , and so a variable reference becomes a simple load or store instruction with a base-plus-offset addressing mode .
secondly , lexical scope ( combined with indefinite extent ) gives rise to the lexical closure , which in turn creates a whole paradigm of programming centered around the use of functions being first-class objects , which is at the root of functional programming .
thirdly , perhaps most importantly , even if lexical closures are not exploited , the use of lexical scope isolates program modules from unwanted interactions .
due to their restricted visibility , lexical variables are private .
if one module a binds a lexical variable x , and calls another module b , references to x in b will not accidentally resolve to the x bound in a .
b simply has no access to x .
for situations in which disciplined interactions through a variable are desirable , common lisp provides special variables .
special variables allow for a module a to set up a binding for a variable x which is visible to another module b , called from a .
being able to do this is an advantage , and being able to prevent it from happening is also an advantage ; consequently , common lisp supports both lexical and dynamic scope .
a " macro " in lisp superficially resembles a function in usage .
however , rather than representing an expression which is evaluated , it represents a transformation of the program source code .
the macro gets the source it surrounds as arguments , binds them to its parameters and computes a new source form .
this new form can also use a macro .
the macro expansion is repeated until the new source form does not use a macro .
the final computed form is the source code executed at runtime .
typical uses of macros in lisp : various standard common lisp features also need to be implemented as macros , such as : macros are defined by the " defmacro " macro .
the special operator " macrolet " allows the definition of local ( lexically scoped ) macros .
it is also possible to define macros for symbols using " define-symbol-macro " and " symbol-macrolet " .
paul graham's book on lisp describes the use of macros in common lisp in detail .
doug hoyte's book let over lambda extends the discussion on macros , claiming " macros are the single greatest advantage that lisp has as a programming language and the single greatest advantage of any programming language .
" hoyte provides several examples of iterative development of macros .
macros allow lisp programmers to create new syntactic forms in the language .
one typical use is to create new control structures .
the example macro provides an codice_73 looping construct .
the syntax is : the macro definition for " until " : "tagbody " is a primitive common lisp special operator which provides the ability to name tags and use the " go " form to jump to those tags .
the backquote " ` " provides a notation that provides code templates , where the value of forms preceded with a comma are filled in .
forms preceded with comma and at-sign are " spliced " in .
the tagbody form tests the end condition .
if the condition is true , it jumps to the end tag .
otherwise the provided body code is executed and then it jumps to the start tag .
an example form using above " until " macro : the code can be expanded using the function " macroexpand-1 " .
the expansion for above example looks like this : during macro expansion the value of the variable " test " is " ( = ( random *num* ) *num* ) " and the value of the variable " body " is " ( ( write-line " hello " ) ) " .
the body is a list of forms .
symbols are usually automatically upcased .
the expansion uses the tagbody with two labels .
the symbols for these labels are computed by gensym and are not interned in any package .
two " go " forms use these tags to jump to .
since " tagbody " is a primitive operator in common lisp ( and not a macro ) , it will not be expanded into something else .
the expanded form uses the " when " macro , which also will be expanded .
fully expanding a source form is called " code walking " .
in the fully expanded ( " walked " ) form , the " when " form is replaced by the primitive " if " : all macros must be expanded before the source code containing them can be evaluated or compiled normally .
macros can be considered functions that accept and return s-expressions - similar to abstract syntax trees , but not limited to those .
these functions are invoked before the evaluator or compiler to produce the final source code .
macros are written in normal common lisp , and may use any common lisp ( or third-party ) operator available .
common lisp macros are capable of what is commonly called " variable capture " , where symbols in the macro-expansion body coincide with those in the calling context , allowing the programmer to create macros wherein various symbols have special meaning .
the term " variable capture " is somewhat misleading , because all namespaces are vulnerable to unwanted capture , including the operator and function namespace , the tagbody label namespace , catch tag , condition handler and restart namespaces .
"variable capture " can introduce software defects .
this happens in one of the following two ways : the scheme dialect of lisp provides a macro-writing system which provides the referential transparency that eliminates both types of capture problem .
this type of macro system is sometimes called " hygienic " , in particular by its proponents ( who regard macro systems which do not automatically solve this problem as unhygienic ) .
in common lisp , macro hygiene is ensured one of two different ways .
one approach is to use gensyms : guaranteed-unique symbols which can be used in a macro-expansion without threat of capture .
the use of gensyms in a macro definition is a manual chore , but macros can be written which simplify the instantiation and use of gensyms .
gensyms solve type *num* capture easily , but they are not applicable to type *num* capture in the same way , because the macro expansion cannot rename the interfering symbols in the surrounding code which capture its references .
gensyms could be used to provide stable aliases for the global symbols which the macro expansion needs .
the macro expansion would use these secret aliases rather than the well-known names , so redefinition of the well-known names would have no ill effect on the macro .
another approach is to use packages .
a macro defined in its own package can simply use internal symbols in that package in its expansion .
the use of packages deals with type *num* and type *num* capture .
however , packages don't solve the type *num* capture of references to standard common lisp functions and operators .
the reason is that the use of packages to solve capture problems revolves around the use of private symbols ( symbols in one package , which are not imported into , or otherwise made visible in other packages ) .
whereas the common lisp library symbols are external , and frequently imported into or made visible in user-defined packages .
the following is an example of unwanted capture in the operator namespace , occurring in the expansion of a macro : the codice_73 macro will expand into a form which calls codice_75 which is intended to refer to the standard common lisp macro codice_75 .
however , in this context , codice_75 may have a completely different meaning , so codice_73 may not work properly .
common lisp solves the problem of the shadowing of standard operators and functions by forbidding their redefinition .
because it redefines the standard operator codice_75 , the preceding is actually a fragment of non-conforming common lisp , which allows implementations to diagnose and reject it .
the " condition system " is responsible for exception handling in common lisp .
it provides " conditions " , " handler"s and " restart"s .
" condition"s are objects describing an exceptional situation ( for example an error ) .
if a " condition " is signaled , the common lisp system searches for a " handler " for this condition type and calls the handler .
the " handler " can now search for restarts and use one of these restarts to automatically repair the current problem , using information such as the condition type and any relevant information provided as part of the condition object , and call the appropriate restart function .
these restarts , if unhandled by code , can be presented to users ( as part of a user interface , that of a debugger for example ) , so that the user can select and invoke one of the available restarts .
since the condition handler is called in the context of the error ( without unwinding the stack ) , full error recovery is possible in many cases , where other exception handling systems would have already terminated the current routine .
the debugger itself can also be customized or replaced using the codice_80 dynamic variable .
code found within " unwind-protect " forms such as finalizers will also be executed as appropriate despite the exception .
in the following example ( using symbolics genera ) the user tries to open a file in a lisp function " test " called from the read-eval-print-loop ( repl ) , when the file does not exist .
the lisp system presents four restarts .
the user selects the " retry open using a different pathname " restart and enters a different pathname ( lispm-init .
lisp instead of lispm-int .
lisp ) .
the user code does not contain any error handling code .
the whole error handling and restart code is provided by the lisp system , which can handle and repair the error without terminating the user code .
common lisp includes a toolkit for object-oriented programming , the common lisp object system or clos , which is one of the most powerful object systems available in any language .
for example , peter norvig explains how many design patterns are simpler to implement in a dynamic language with the features of clos ( multiple inheritance , mixins , multimethods , metaclasses , method combinations , etc .
) .
several extensions to common lisp for object-oriented programming have been proposed to be included into the ansi common lisp standard , but eventually clos was adopted as the standard object-system for common lisp .
clos is a dynamic object system with multiple dispatch and multiple inheritance , and differs radically from the oop facilities found in static languages such as c++ or java .
as a dynamic object system , clos allows changes at runtime to generic functions and classes .
methods can be added and removed , classes can be added and redefined , objects can be updated for class changes and the class of objects can be changed .
clos has been integrated into ansi common lisp .
generic functions can be used like normal functions and are a first-class data type .
every clos class is integrated into the common lisp type system .
many common lisp types have a corresponding class .
there is more potential use of clos for common lisp .
the specification does not say whether conditions are implemented with clos .
pathnames and streams could be implemented with clos .
these further usage possibilities of clos for ansi common lisp are not part of the standard .
actual common lisp implementations use clos for pathnames , streams , input–output , conditions , the implementation of clos itself and more .
several implementations of earlier lisp dialects provided both an interpreter and a compiler .
unfortunately often the semantics were different .
these earlier lisps implemented lexical scoping in the compiler and dynamic scoping in the interpreter .
common lisp requires that both the interpreter and compiler use lexical scoping by default .
the common lisp standard describes both the semantics of the interpreter and a compiler .
the compiler can be called using the function " compile " for individual functions and using the function " compile-file " for files .
common lisp allows type declarations and provides ways to influence the compiler code generation policy .
for the latter various optimization qualities can be given values between *num* ( not important ) and *num* ( most important ) : " speed " , " space " , " safety " , " debug " and " compilation-speed " .
there is also a function to evaluate lisp code : codice_81 .
codice_81 takes code as pre-parsed s-expressions and not , like in some other languages , as text strings .
this way code can be constructed with the usual lisp functions for constructing lists and symbols and then this code can be evaluated with the function codice_81 .
several common lisp implementations ( like clozure cl and sbcl ) are implementing codice_81 using their compiler .
this way code is compiled , even though it is evaluated using the function codice_81 .
the file compiler is invoked using the function " compile-file " .
the generated file with compiled code is called a " fasl " ( from " fast load " ) file .
these " fasl " files and also source code files can be loaded with the function " load " into a running common lisp system .
depending on the implementation , the file compiler generates byte-code ( for example for the java virtual machine ) , c language code ( which then is compiled with a c compiler ) or , directly , native code .
common lisp implementations can be used interactively , even though the code gets fully compiled .
the idea of an interpreted language thus does not apply for interactive common lisp .
the language makes distinction between read-time , compile-time , load-time and run-time , and allows user code to also make this distinction to perform the wanted type of processing at the wanted step .
some special operators are provided to especially suit interactive development ; for instance , codice_86 will only assign a value to its provided variable if it wasn't already bound , while codice_87 will always perform the assignment .
this distinction is useful when interactively evaluating , compiling and loading code in a live image .
some features are also provided to help writing compilers and interpreters .
symbols consist of first-level objects and are directly manipulable by user code .
the codice_88 special operator allows to create lexical bindings programmatically , while packages are also manipulable .
the lisp compiler is available at runtime to compile files or individual functions .
these make it easy to use lisp as an intermediate compiler or interpreter for another language .
the following program calculates the smallest number of people in a room for whom the probability of completely unique birthdays is less than *num* % ( the birthday paradox , where for *num* person the probability is obviously *num* % , for *num* it is *num* / *num* , etc .
) .
the answer is *num* .
by convention , constants in common lisp are enclosed with + characters .
calling the example function using the repl ( read eval print loop ) : we define a class codice_89 and a method for displaying the name and age of a person .
next we define a group of persons as a list of codice_89 objects .
then we iterate over the sorted list .
it prints the three names with descending age .
use of the loop macro is demonstrated : example use : compare with the built in exponentiation : with-open-file is a macro that opens a file and provides a stream .
when the form is returning , the file is automatically closed .
funcall calls a function object .
the loop collects all lines that match the predicate .
the function available-shells calls above function list-matching-lines with a pathname and an anonymous function as the predicate .
the predicate returns the pathname of a shell or nil ( if the string is not the filename of a shell ) .
example results ( on mac os x *num* .
*num* ) : common lisp is most frequently compared with , and contrasted to , scheme—if only because they are the two most popular lisp dialects .
scheme predates cl , and comes not only from the same lisp tradition but from some of the same engineers—guy l .
steele , with whom gerald jay sussman designed scheme , chaired the standards committee for common lisp .
common lisp is a general-purpose programming language , in contrast to lisp variants such as emacs lisp and autolisp which are extension languages embedded in particular products ( gnu emacs and autocad , respectively ) .
unlike many earlier lisps , common lisp ( like scheme ) uses lexical variable scope by default for both interpreted and compiled code .
most of the lisp systems whose designs contributed to common lisp—such as zetalisp and franz lisp—used dynamically scoped variables in their interpreters and lexically scoped variables in their compilers .
scheme introduced the sole use of lexically scoped variables to lisp ; an inspiration from algol *num* which was widely recognized as a good idea .
cl supports dynamically scoped variables as well , but they must be explicitly declared as " special " .
there are no differences in scoping between ansi cl interpreters and compilers .
common lisp is sometimes termed a " lisp-2 " and scheme a " lisp-1 " , referring to cl's use of separate namespaces for functions and variables .
( in fact , cl has " many " namespaces , such as those for go tags , block names , and codice_72 keywords ) .
there is a long-standing controversy between cl and scheme advocates over the tradeoffs involved in multiple namespaces .
in scheme , it is ( broadly ) necessary to avoid giving variables names which clash with functions ; scheme functions frequently have arguments named codice_92 , codice_93 , or codice_94 so as not to conflict with the system function codice_95 .
however , in cl it is necessary to explicitly refer to the function namespace when passing a function as an argument—which is also a common occurrence , as in the codice_11 example above .
cl also differs from scheme in its handling of boolean values .
scheme uses the special values #t and #f to represent truth and falsity .
cl follows the older lisp convention of using the symbols t and nil , with nil standing also for the empty list .
in cl , " any " non-nil value is treated as true by conditionals , such as codice_68 , whereas in scheme all non-#f values are treated as true .
these conventions allow some operators in both languages to serve both as predicates ( answering a boolean-valued question ) and as returning a useful value for further computation , but in scheme the value ' ( ) which is equivalent to nil in common lisp evaluates to true in a boolean expression .
lastly , the scheme standards documents require tail-call optimization , which the cl standard does not .
most cl implementations do offer tail-call optimization , although often only when the programmer uses an optimization directive .
nonetheless , common cl coding style does not favor the ubiquitous use of recursion that scheme style prefers—what a scheme programmer would express with tail recursion , a cl user would usually express with an iterative expression in codice_75 , codice_99 , codice_72 , or ( more recently ) with the codice_101 package .

common lisp is defined by a specification ( like ada and c ) rather than by one implementation ( like perl before version *num* ) .
there are many implementations , and the standard details areas in which they may validly differ .
in addition , implementations tend to come with extensions , which provide functionality not covered in the standard : free and open-source software libraries have been created to support extensions to common lisp in a portable way , and are most notably found in the repositories of the common-lisp .
net and clocc ( common lisp open code collection ) projects .
common lisp implementations may use any mix of native code compilation , byte code compilation or interpretation .
common lisp has been designed to support incremental compilers , file compilers and block compilers .
standard declarations to optimize compilation ( such as function inlining or type specialization ) are proposed in the language specification .
most common lisp implementations compile source code to native machine code .
some implementations can create ( optimized ) stand-alone applications .
others compile to interpreted bytecode , which is less efficient than native code , but eases binary-code portability .
there are also compilers that compile common lisp code to c code .
the misconception that lisp is a purely interpreted language is most likely because lisp environments provide an interactive prompt and that code is compiled one-by-one , in an incremental way .
with common lisp incremental compilation is widely used .
some unix-based implementations ( clisp , sbcl ) can be used as a scripting language ; that is , invoked by the system transparently in the way that a perl or unix shell interpreter is .
see the category .
common lisp is used to develop research applications ( often in artificial intelligence ) , for rapid development of prototypes or for deployed applications common lisp is used in many commercial applications , including the yahoo ! store web-commerce site , which originally involved paul graham and was later rewritten in c++ and perl .
other notable examples include : there also exist open-source applications written in common lisp , such as : since *num* , zach beane , with support of the common lisp foundation , has maintained the quicklisp library manager .
it allows automatic download , installing , and loading of over *num* libraries , all of which are required to work on more than just one implementation of common lisp and to have a license that allows their redistribution .

bearshare bearshare was a peer-to-peer file sharing application originally created by free peers , inc .
for microsoft windows and also a rebranded version of imesh by musiclab , llc , tightly integrated with their music subscription service .
the principal operators of free peers , inc .
were vincent falco and louis tatta .
bearshare was launched on december *num* , *num* as a gnutella-based peer-to-peer file sharing application with innovative features that eventually grew to include irc , a free library of software and media called bearshare featured artists , online help pages and a support forum integrated as dedicated web browser windows in the application ; as well as a media player and a library window to organize the user's media collection .
following the june *num* , *num* united states supreme court decision on the " mgm studios , inc .
v .
grokster , ltd .
" case the bearshare community support forums were abruptly closed during negotiations to settle an impending lawsuit with the riaa .
the webmaster and forum administrator immediately created a new site called technutopia and the same support staff continue to support the gnutella versions from there .
a few months later the unused community window was removed from bearshare *num* .
*num* .
on may *num* , *num* , free peers agreed to transfer all their bearshare-related assets to musiclab , llc ( an imesh subsidiary ) and use the $30 million raised from that sale to settle with the riaa .
on august *num* , *num* , musiclab released a reskinned and updated version of imesh named bearsharev6 which connected to its proprietary imesh network instead of gnutella .
bearsharev6 and its successors offer paid music downloads in the playsforsure drm controlled wma format as well as free content in various formats , chiefly mp3 .
like bearshare they also include a media player and embedded online and social networking features but with a web *num* .
*num* style , somewhat similar to myspace or facebook .
free content provided by users is automatically verified using acoustic fingerprinting as non-infringing before it can be shared .
video files more than *num* mb in size and *num* minutes in length cannot be shared , ensuring television shows and feature-length movies cannot be distributed over the network .
only a limited set of music and video file types can be shared , thus excluding everything else like executable files , documents and compressed archives .
in august *num* , musiclab released a variant of the original bearshare gnutella servant , called bearflix , which was altered to limit sharing , searches and downloads to images and videos .
shared videos were limited in length and duration , similar to limits in bearsharev6 .
the first release was version *num* .

rod ( optics ) in cryptozoology and ufology , " rods " ( also known as " skyfish " , " air rods " , or " solar entities " ) are elongated visual artifacts appearing in photographic images and video recordings .
some paranormal proponents claim them to be extraterrestrial lifeforms , extradimensional creatures , or very small ufos .
however , these artifacts appear naturally in video and outdoor photography as the result of an optical illusion due to motion blur , especially in interlaced video recording , and are typically afterimage trails of flying insects and their wingbeats .
various paranormal interpretations appeared in popular culture , and one of the more outspoken proponents of rods as alien life forms was the late jose escamilla , who claimed to have been the first to film them on march *num* , *num* at roswell , new mexico , while attempting to film a ufo .
escamilla later made additional videos and embarked on lecture tours to promote his claims .
the straight dope columnist cecil adams called rods a hoax " where unscrupulous people are exploiting a gullible public for profit " , and said that investigators have shown that rods are mere tricks of light which result from how images ( primarily video images ) of flying insects are recorded and played back .
in particular , the fast passage before the camera of an insect flapping its wings has been shown to produce rodlike effects , due to motion blur , if the camera is shooting with relatively long exposure times .
in august *num* , china central television ( cctv ) aired a two-part documentary about flying rods in china .
it reported the events from may to june of the same year at tonghua zhenguo pharmaceutical company in tonghua city , jilin province , which debunked the flying rods .
surveillance cameras in the facility's compound captured video footage of flying rods identical to those shown in jose escamilla's video .
getting no satisfactory answer to the phenomenon , curious scientists at the facility decided that they would try to solve the mystery by attempting to catch these airborne creatures .
huge nets were set up and the same surveillance cameras then captured images of rods flying into the trap .
when the nets were inspected , the " rods " were no more than regular moths and other ordinary flying insects .
subsequent investigations proved that the appearance of flying rods on video was an optical illusion created by the slower recording speed of the camera .
after attending a lecture by jose escamilla , ufo investigator robert sheaffer wrote that " some of his “rods” were obviously insects zipping across the field at a high angular rate " and others appeared to be “appendages” which were birds ' wings blurred by the camera exposure .
computing computing is any activity that uses computers .
it includes developing hardware and software , and using computers to manage and process information , communicate and entertain .
computing is a critically important , integral component of modern industrial technology .
major computing disciplines include computer engineering , software engineering , computer science , information systems , and information technology .
the acm " computing curricula *num* " defined " computing " as follows : and it defines five sub-disciplines of the " computing " field : computer science , computer engineering , information systems , information technology , and software engineering .
however , " computing curricula *num* " also recognizes that the meaning of " computing " depends on the context : the term " computing " has sometimes been narrowly defined , as in a *num* acm report on " computing as a discipline " : the term " computing " is also synonymous with counting and calculating .
in earlier times , it was used in reference to the action performed by mechanical computing machines , and before that , to human computers .
the history of computing is longer than the history of computing hardware and modern computing technology and includes the history of methods intended for pen and paper or for chalk and slate , with or without the aid of tables .
computing is intimately tied to the representation of numbers .
but long before abstractions like " the number " arose , there were mathematical concepts to serve the purposes of civilization .
these concepts include one-to-one correspondence ( the basis of counting ) , comparison to a standard ( used for measurement ) , and the " 3-4-5 " right triangle ( a device for assuring a " right angle " ) .
the earliest known tool for use in computation was the abacus , and it was thought to have been invented in babylon circa *num* bc .
its original style of usage was by lines drawn in sand with pebbles .
abaci , of a more modern design , are still used as calculation tools today .
this was the first known calculation aid - preceding greek methods by *num* , *num* years .
the first recorded idea of using digital electronics for computing was the *num* paper " the use of thyratrons for high speed automatic counting of physical phenomena " by c .
e .
wynn-williams .
claude shannon's *num* paper " a symbolic analysis of relay and switching circuits " then introduced the idea of using electronics for boolean algebraic operations .
a computer is a machine that manipulates data according to a set of instructions called a computer program .
the program has an executable form that the computer can use directly to execute the instructions .
the same program in its human-readable source code form , enables a programmer to study and develop a sequence of steps known as an algorithm .
because the instructions can be carried out in different types of computers , a single set of source instructions converts to machine instructions according to the central processing unit type .
the execution process carries out the instructions in a computer program .
instructions express the computations performed by the computer .
they trigger sequences of simple actions on the executing machine .
those actions produce effects according to the semantics of the instructions .
computer software or just " software " , is a collection of computer programs and related data that provides the instructions for telling a computer what to do and how to do it .
software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the computer for some purposes .
in other words , software is a set of " programs , procedures , algorithms " and its " documentation " concerned with the operation of a data processing system .
program software performs the function of the program it implements , either by directly providing instructions to the computer hardware or by serving as input to another piece of software .
the term was coined to contrast with the old term hardware ( meaning physical devices ) .
in contrast to hardware , software is intangible .
software is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense , meaning application software only .
application software , also known as an " application " or an " app " , is a computer software designed to help the user to perform specific tasks .
examples include enterprise software , accounting software , office suites , graphics software and media players .
many application programs deal principally with documents .
apps may be bundled with the computer and its system software , or may be published separately .
some users are satisfied with the bundled apps and need never install one .
application software is contrasted with system software and middleware , which manage and integrate a computer's capabilities , but typically do not directly apply them in the performance of tasks that benefit the user .
the system software serves the application , which in turn serves the user .
application software applies the power of a particular computing platform or system software to a particular purpose .
some apps such as microsoft office are available in versions for several different platforms ; others have narrower requirements and are thus called , for example , a geography application for windows or an android application for education or linux gaming .
sometimes a new and popular application arises that only runs on one platform , increasing the desirability of that platform .
this is called a killer application .
system software , or systems software , is computer software designed to operate and control the computer hardware and to provide a platform for running application software .
system software includes operating systems , utility software , device drivers , window systems , and firmware .
frequently development tools such as compilers , linkers , and debuggers are classified as system software .
a computer network , often simply referred to as a network , is a collection of hardware components and computers interconnected by communication channels that allow sharing of resources and information .
where at least one process in one device is able to send / receive data to / from at least one process residing in a remote device , then the two devices are said to be in a network .
networks may be classified according to a wide variety of characteristics such as the medium used to transport the data , communications protocol used , scale , topology , and organizational scope .
communications protocols define the rules and data formats for exchanging information in a computer network , and provide the basis for network programming .
well-known communications protocols are ethernet , a hardware and link layer standard that is ubiquitous in local area networks , and the internet protocol suite , which defines a set of protocols for internetworking , i .
e .
for data communication between multiple networks , as well as host-to-host data transfer , and application-specific data transmission formats .
computer networking is sometimes considered a sub-discipline of electrical engineering , telecommunications , computer science , information technology or computer engineering , since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of these disciplines .
the internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard internet protocol suite ( tcp / ip ) to serve billions of users that consists of millions of private , public , academic , business , and government networks , of local to global scope , that are linked by a broad array of electronic , wireless and optical networking technologies .
the internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services , such as the inter-linked hypertext documents of the world wide web ( www ) and the infrastructure to support email .
computer programming in general is the process of writing , testing , debugging , and maintaining the source code and documentation of computer programs .
this source code is written in a programming language , which is an artificial language often more restrictive or demanding than natural languages , but easily translated by the computer .
the purpose of programming is to invoke the desired behavior ( customization ) from the machine .
the process of writing high quality source code requires knowledge of both the application's domain " and " the computer science domain .
the highest-quality software is thus developed by a team of various domain experts , each person a specialist in some area of development .
but the term " programmer " may apply to a range of program quality , from hacker to open source contributor to professional .
and a single programmer could do most or all of the computer programming needed to generate the proof of concept to launch a new " killer " application .
a programmer , computer programmer , or coder is a person who writes computer software .
the term " computer programmer " can refer to a specialist in one area of computer programming or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software .
one who practices or professes a formal approach to programming may also be known as a programmer analyst .
a programmer's primary computer language ( c , c++ , java , lisp , python , etc .
) is often prefixed to the above titles , and those who work in a web environment often prefix their titles with " web " .
the term " programmer " can be used to refer to a software developer , software engineer , computer scientist , or software analyst .
however , members of these professions typically possess other software engineering skills , beyond programming .
the computer industry is made up of all of the businesses involved in developing computer software , designing computer hardware and computer networking infrastructures , the manufacture of computer components and the provision of information technology services including system administration and maintenance .
the software industry includes businesses engaged in development , maintenance and publication of software .
the industry also includes software services , such as training , documentation , and consulting .
computer engineering is a discipline that integrates several fields of electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer hardware and software .
computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering ( or electrical engineering ) , software design , and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering .
computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing , from the design of individual microprocessors , personal computers , and supercomputers , to circuit design .
this field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work , but also how they integrate into the larger picture .
software engineering ( se ) is the application of a systematic , disciplined , quantifiable approach to the design , development , operation , and maintenance of software , and the study of these approaches ; that is , the application of engineering to software .
in layman's terms , it is the act of using insights to conceive , model and scale a solution to a problem .
the first reference to the term is the *num* nato software engineering conference and was meant to provoke thought regarding the perceived " software crisis " at the time .
" software development " , a much used and more generic term , does not necessarily subsume the engineering paradigm .
the generally accepted concepts of software engineering as an engineering discipline have been specified in the guide to the software engineering body of knowledge ( swebok ) .
the swebok has become an internationally accepted standard iso / iec tr *num* : *num* .
computer science or computing science ( abbreviated cs or comp sci ) is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications .
a computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems .
its subfields can be divided into practical techniques for its implementation and application in computer systems and purely theoretical areas .
some , such as computational complexity theory , which studies fundamental properties of computational problems , are highly abstract , while others , such as computer graphics , emphasize real-world applications .
still others focus on the challenges in implementing computations .
for example , programming language theory studies approaches to description of computations , while the study of computer programming itself investigates various aspects of the use of programming languages and complex systems , and human–computer interaction focuses on the challenges in making computers and computations useful , usable , and universally accessible to humans .
"information systems ( is ) " is the study of complementary networks of hardware and software ( see information technology ) that people and organizations use to collect , filter , process , create , and distribute data .
the acm's " computing careers " website says the study bridges business and computer science using the theoretical foundations of information and computation to study various business models and related algorithmic processes within a computer science discipline .
this field studies computers and algorithmic processes , including their principles , their software and hardware designs , their applications , and their impact on society while is emphasizes functionality over design .
information technology ( it ) is the application of computers and telecommunications equipment to store , retrieve , transmit and manipulate data , often in the context of a business or other enterprise .
the term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks , but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones .
several industries are associated with information technology , such as computer hardware , software , electronics , semiconductors , internet , telecom equipment , e-commerce and computer services .
a system administrator , it systems administrator , systems administrator , or sysadmin is a person employed to maintain and operate a computer system or network .
the duties of a system administrator are wide-ranging , and may vary substantially from one organization to another .
sysadmins are usually charged with installing , supporting and maintaining servers or other computer systems , and planning for and responding to service outages and other problems .
other duties may include scripting or light programming , project management for systems-related projects , supervising or training computer operators , and being the consultant for computer problems beyond the knowledge of technical support staff .
dna-based computing and quantum computing are areas of active research in both hardware and software ( such as the development of quantum algorithms ) .
potential infrastructure for future technologies includes dna origami on photolithography and quantum antennae for transferring information between ion traps .
by *num* , researchers had entangled *num* qubits .
fast digital circuits ( including those based on josephson junctions and rapid single flux quantum technology ) are becoming more nearly realizable with the discovery of nanoscale superconductors .
fiber-optic and photonic ( optical ) devices , which already have been used to transport data over long distances , have started being used by data centers , side by side with cpu and semiconductor memory components .
this allows the separation of ram from cpu by optical interconnects .
ibm has created an integrated circuit with both electronic and optical information processing in one chip .
this is denoted " cmos-integrated nanophotonics " or ( cinp ) .
one benefit of optical interconnects is that motherboards which formerly required a certain kind of system on a chip ( soc ) can now move formerly dedicated memory and network controllers off the motherboards , spreading the controllers out onto the rack .
this allows standardization of backplane interconnects and motherboards for multiple types of socs , which allows more timely upgrades of cpus .
eritrean defence forces the eritrean defence forces military role stems from eritrea's strategic geographical location .
it is located on the red sea with a foothold on the straits of bab al-mandeb .
military history in eritrea stretches back for thousands of years ; during ancient times up until the current day , the society of eritreans has dealt with war and peace .
during the kingdom of medri bahri , the military fought numerous battles against the invading forces of the abyssinians to the south and the ottoman turks at the red sea .
in the *ord* century the port of massawa was used by the ottomans to protect sea lanes from disruption , while more recently it was used by the italians during their colonial occupation .
the kingdom of medri bahri was dissolved and the colony of eritrea was founded by the italians in *num* , shortly after the opening of the suez canal .
when italian troops occupied ethiopia in *num* , eritrean native soldiers ( known as askaris or " banda " , the latter denotes their " betrayal " and service for the enemy ) supported the invading force .
however , this was reversed by british and ethiopian troops in *num* .
the eritrean infantry battalions and cavalry squadrons of the " reale esercito coloniale " ( royal colonial army ) saw extensive service in the various italian colonial territories between *num* and *num* .
during the war for eritrea's independence rebel movements ( the elf and the eplf ) used volunteers .
in the final years of the struggle for independence , the eplf ranks grew to *num* , *num* volunteers ( some *num* % of the total population ) .
the eritrean defence forces are among the largest in africa alongside those of egypt , algeria , and morocco .
the size of eritrea's population is small , particularly when compared to its neighbors .
during peacetime the military of eritrea numbers approximately *num* , *num* with a reserve force of approximately *num* , *num* .
every able bodied man and woman is required to serve ostensibly for *num* months .
in this time they receive six months of military training and the balance is spent working on national reconstruction projects .
this is outlined in both the constitution of eritrea and proclamation *num* issued by the national assembly on 1995-10-23 .
however , the period of enlistment may be extended during times of national crisis and the typical period of national service is considerably longer than the minimum .
this program allegedly aims to compensate for eritrea’s lack of capital and to reduce dependence on foreign aid , while welding together an ethnically diverse society , half christian and half muslim , representing nine ethnic groups .
military training is given at the sawa defence training centre and kiloma military training centre .
students , both male and female , are required to attend the sawa training centre to complete the final year of their secondary education , which is integrated with their military service .
if a student does not attend this period of training , he or she will not be allowed to attend university - many routes to employment also require proof of military training .
however , they may be able to attend a vocational training centre , or to find work in the private sector .
at the end of the 1½-year national service , a conscript can elect to stay on and become a career military officer .
conscripts who elect otherwise may , in theory , return to their civilian life but will continue to be reservists .
in practice , graduates of military service are often chosen for further national service according to their vocation - for example , teachers may be compulsorily seconded for several years to schools in an unfamiliar region of the country .
according to the government of eritrea , " the sole objective of the national service program is thus to cultivate capable , hardworking , and alert individuals .
" eritrean conscripts are used in non-military capacities as well .
soldiers are often used as supplemental manpower in the country's agricultural fields picking crops , though much of the harvested food is used to feed the military rather than the general population .
the eritrean defence forces ( edf ) are composed of three branches : air force , army , and navy .
the army is by far the largest , followed by the air force and navy .
the commander-in-chief of the edf is the president of eritrea .
the minister of defence oversees the edf on a day-to-day basis .

agrarianism agrarianism is a social philosophy or political philosophy which values rural society as superior to urban society and the independent farmer as superior to the paid worker , and sees farming as a way of life that can shape the ideal social values .
it stresses the superiority of a simpler rural life as opposed to the complexity of city life .
m .
thomas inge defines agrarianism by the following basic tenets : the philosophical roots of agrarianism include european and chinese philosophers .
the chinese school of agriculturalism ( 农家 / 農家 ) was a philosophy that advocated peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism .
in societies influenced by confucianism , the farmer was considered an esteemed productive member of society , but merchants who made money were looked down upon .
that influenced european intellectuals like françois quesnay , an avid confucianist and advocate of china's agrarian policies , in forming the french agrarian philosophy of physiocracy .
the physiocrats , along with the ideas of john locke and the romantic era , formed the basis of modern european and american agrarianism .
united states president ( 1801–1809 ) thomas jefferson was a representative agrarian who built jeffersonian democracy around the notion that farmers are “the most valuable citizens” and the truest republicans .
peasant parties first appeared across eastern europe between *num* and *num* , when commercialized agriculture and world market forces disrupted traditional rural society , and the railway and growing literacy facilitated the work of roving organizers .
agrarian parties advocated land reforms to redistribute land on large estates among those who work it .
they also wanted village cooperatives to keep the profit from crop sales in local hands and credit institutions to underwrite needed improvements .
many peasant parties were also nationalist parties because peasants often worked their land for the benefit of landlords of different ethnicity .
peasant parties rarely had any power before world war i but some became influential in the interwar era , especially in bulgaria and czechoslovakia .
for a while , in the 1920s and the 1930s , there was a green international ( international agrarian bureau ) based on the peasant parties in bulgaria , czechoslovakia , poland , and serbia .
it functioned primarily as an information center that spread the ideas of agrarianism and combating socialism on the left and landlords on the right and never launched any significant activities .
the farmers ' voice party won a seat in the district of jendouba after the parliamentary election of *num* .
in bulgaria , the bulgarian agrarian national union ( bzns ) was organized in *num* to resist taxes and build cooperatives .
bzns came to power in *num* and introduced many economic , social , and legal reforms .
however , conservative forces crushed bzns in a *num* coup and assassinated its leader , aleksandar stamboliyski ( 1879–1923 ) .
bzns was made into a communist puppet group until *num* , when it reorganized as a genuine party .
in czechoslovakia , the republican party of agricultural and smallholder people often shared power in parliament as a partner in the five-party pětka coalition .
the party's leader , antonin svehla ( 1873–1933 ) , was prime minister several times .
it was consistently the strongest party , forming and dominating coalitions .
it moved beyond its original agrarian base to reach middle-class voters .
the party was banned by the national front after the second world war .
in france , the hunting , fishing , nature , tradition party is a moderate conservative , agrarianist party , reaching a peak of *num* .
*num* % in the french presidential election , *num* .
it would later on become affiliated to france's main conservative party , union for a popular movement .
in the late *ord* century , the irish national land league aimed to abolish landlordism in ireland and enable tenant farmers to own the land they worked on .
the " land war " of 1878–1909 led to the irish land acts , ending absentee landlords and ground rent and redistributing land among peasant farmers .
post-independence , the farmers ' party operated in the irish free state from *num* , folding into the national centre party in *num* .
it was mostly supported by wealthy farmers in the east of ireland .
clann na talmhan ( family of the land ; also called the " national agricultural party " ) were founded in *num* .
they focused more on the poor smallholders of the west , supporting land reclamation , afforestation , social democracy and rates reform .
they formed part of the governing coalition of the government of the *ord* dáil and government of the *ord* dáil .
economic improvement in the 1960s saw farmers vote for other parties and clann na talmhan disbanded in *num* .
in latvia , the union of greens and farmers is supportive of traditional small farms and perceives them as more environmentally friendly than large-scale farming : nature is threatened by development , while small farms are threatened by large industrial-scale farms .
in lithuania , as of *num* , the government is led by the lithuanian farmers and greens union , under the leadership of industrial farmer ramūnas karbauskis .
in poland , the polish people's party traces its tradition to an agrarian party in austro-hungarian-controlled galician poland .
after the fall of the communist regime , ppp's biggest success came in *num* elections , where it won *num* out of *num* parliamentary seats .
since then , ppp's support has steadily declined .
in romania , older parties from transylvania , moldavia , and wallachia merged to become the national peasants ' party in *num* .
iuliu maniu ( 1873–1953 ) was a prime minister with an agrarian cabinet from 1928–1930 and briefly in 1932–1933 , but the great depression made proposed reforms impossible .
the communist regime dissolved the party in *num* , but it reformed in *num* after they fell from power .
the reformed party , which also incorporated elements of christian democracy in its ideology , governed romania as part of the romanian democratic convention between 1996–2000 .
in serbia , nikola pašić ( 1845–1926 ) and his people's radical party dominated serbian politics after *num* .
the party also monopolized power in yugoslavia from *num* to *num* .
during the dictatorship of the 1930s , the prime minister was from that party .
in ukraine , the radical party of oleh lyashko has promised to purify the country of oligarchs " with a pitchfork " .
the party advocates a number of traditional left-wing positions ( lower salary taxes , a ban on agricultural land sale and eliminating the illegal land market , a tenfold increase in budget spending on health , setting up primary health centres in every village ) , and mixes them with strong nationalist sentiments .
historian f .
k .
crowley finds that : the national party of australia ( formerly called the country party ) , from the 1920s to the 1970s , promulgated its version of agrarianism , which it called " countrymindedness " .
the goal was to enhance the status of the graziers ( operators of big sheep ranches ) and small farmers and justified subsidies for them .
the new zealand liberal party aggressively promoted agrarianism in its heyday ( 1891–1912 ) .
the landed gentry and aristocracy ruled britain at this time .
new zealand never had an aristocracy but its wealthy landowners largely controlled politics before *num* .
the liberal party set out to change that by a policy it called " populism .
" richard seddon had proclaimed the goal as early as *num* : " it is the rich and the poor ; it is the wealthy and the landowners against the middle and labouring classes .
that , sir , shows the real political position of new zealand .
" the liberal strategy was to create a large class of small landowning farmers who supported liberal ideals .
the liberal government also established the basis of the later welfare state such as old age pensions and developed a system for settling industrial disputes , which was accepted by both employers and trade unions .
in *num* , it extended voting rights to women , making new zealand the first country in the world to do so .
to obtain land for farmers , the liberal government from *num* to *num* purchased of maori land .
the government also purchased from large estate holders for subdivision and closer settlement by small farmers .
the advances to settlers act ( *num* ) provided low-interest mortgages , and the agriculture department disseminated information on the best farming methods .
the liberals proclaimed success in forging an egalitarian , anti-monopoly land policy .
the policy built up support for the liberal party in rural north island electorates .
by *num* , the liberals were so dominant that there was no longer an organized opposition in parliament .
agrarianism is similar to but not identical with the back-to-the-land movement .
agrarianism concentrates on the fundamental goods of the earth , on communities of more limited economic and political scale than in modern society , and on simple living , even when the shift involves questioning the " progressive " character of some recent social and economic developments .
thus , agrarianism is not industrial farming , with its specialization on products and industrial scale .

in the southern hemisphere , december *num* is usually the longest day of the year and occurs during the southern summer .
naive set theory naïve set theory is any of several theories of sets used in the discussion of the foundations of mathematics .
unlike axiomatic set theories , which are defined using formal logic , naïve set theory is defined informally , in natural language .
it describes the aspects of mathematical sets familiar in discrete mathematics ( for example venn diagrams and symbolic reasoning about their boolean algebra ) , and suffices for the everyday use of set theory concepts in contemporary mathematics .
sets are of great importance in mathematics ; in modern formal treatments , most mathematical objects ( numbers , relations , functions , etc .
) are defined in terms of sets .
naïve set theory suffices for many purposes , while also serving as a stepping-stone towards more formal treatments .
a " naïve theory " in the sense of " naïve set theory " is a non-formalized theory , that is , a theory that uses a natural language to describe sets and operations on sets .
the words " and " , " or " , " if .
.
.
then " , " not " , " for some " , " for every " are treated as in ordinary mathematics .
as a matter of convenience , use of naïve set theory and its formalism prevails even in higher mathematics – including in more formal settings of set theory itself .
the first development of set theory was a naïve set theory .
it was created at the end of the *ord* century by georg cantor as part of his study of infinite sets and developed by gottlob frege in his " begriffsschrift " .
naïve set theory may refer to several very distinct notions .
it may refer to the assumption that any property may be used to form a set , without restriction , leads to paradoxes .
one common example is russell's paradox : there is no set consisting of " all sets that do not contain themselves " .
thus consistent systems of naïve set theory must include some limitations on the principles which can be used to form sets .
some believe that georg cantor's set theory was not actually implicated in the set-theoretic paradoxes ( see frápolli *num* ) .
one difficulty in determining this with certainty is that cantor did not provide an axiomatization of his system .
by *num* , cantor was aware of some of the paradoxes following from unrestricted interpretation of his theory , for instance cantor's paradox and the burali-forti paradox , and did not believe that they discredited his theory .
cantor's paradox can actually be derived from the above ( false ) assumption using for is a cardinal number " .
frege explicitly axiomatized a theory in which a formalized version of naïve set theory can be interpreted , and it is " this " formal theory which bertrand russell actually addressed when he presented his paradox , not necessarily a theory cantor , who , as mentioned , was aware of several paradoxes , presumably had in mind .
axiomatic set theory was developed in response to these early attempts to understand sets , with the goal of determining precisely what operations were allowed and when .
a naïve set theory is not " necessarily " inconsistent , if it correctly specifies the sets allowed to be considered .
this can be done by the means of definitions , which are implicit axioms .
it is possible to state all the axioms explicitly , as in the case of halmos ' " naïve set theory " , which is actually an informal presentation of the usual axiomatic zermelo–fraenkel set theory .
it is " naïve " in that the language and notations are those of ordinary informal mathematics , and in that it doesn't deal with consistency or completeness of the axiom system .
likewise , an axiomatic set theory is not necessarily consistent : not necessarily free of paradoxes .
it follows from gödel's incompleteness theorems that a sufficiently complicated first order logic system ( which includes most common axiomatic set theories ) cannot be proved consistent from within the theory itself – even if it actually is consistent .
however , the common axiomatic systems are generally believed to be consistent ; by their axioms they do exclude " some " paradoxes , like russell's paradox .
based on gödel's theorem , it is just not known – and never can be – if there are " no " paradoxes at all in these theories or in any first-order set theory .
the term " naïve set theory " is still today also used in some literature to refer to the set theories studied by frege and cantor , rather than to the informal counterparts of modern axiomatic set theory .
the choice between an axiomatic approach and other approaches is largely a matter of convenience .
in everyday mathematics the best choice may be informal use of axiomatic set theory .
references to particular axioms typically then occur only when demanded by tradition , e .
g .
the axiom of choice is often mentioned when used .
likewise , formal proofs occur only when warranted by exceptional circumstances .
this informal usage of axiomatic set theory can have ( depending on notation ) precisely the " appearance " of naïve set theory as outlined below .
it is considerably easier to read and write ( in the formulation of most statements , proofs , and lines of discussion ) and is less error-prone than a strictly formal approach .
in naïve set theory , a set is described as a well-defined collection of objects .
these objects are called the elements or members of the set .
objects can be anything : numbers , people , other sets , etc .
for instance , *num* is a member of the set of all even integers .
clearly , the set of even numbers is infinitely large ; there is no requirement that a set be finite .
the definition of sets goes back to georg cantor .
” – georg cantor “a set is a gathering together into a whole of definite , distinct objects of our perception or of our thought—which are called elements of the set .
” – georg cantor it does " not " follow from this definition " how " sets can be formed , and what operations on sets again will produce a set .
the term " well-defined " in " well-defined collection of objects " cannot , by itself , guarantee the consistency and unambiguity of what exactly constitutes and what does not constitute a set .
attempting to achieve this would be the realm of axiomatic set theory or of axiomatic class theory .
the problem , in this context , with informally formulated set theories , not derived from ( and implying ) any particular axiomatic theory , is that there may be several widely differing formalized versions , that have both different sets and different rules for how new sets may be formed , that all conform to the original informal definition .
for example , cantor's verbatim definition allows for considerable freedom in what constitutes a set .
on the other hand , it is unlikely that cantor was particularly interested in sets containing cats and dogs , but rather only in sets containing purely mathematical objects .
an example of such a class of sets could be the von neumann universe .
but even when fixing the class of sets under consideration , it is not always clear which rules for set formation are allowed without introducing paradoxes .
for the purpose of fixing the discussion below , the term " well-defined " should instead be interpreted as an " intention " , with either implicit or explicit rules ( axioms or definitions ) , to rule out inconsistencies .
the purpose is to keep the often deep and difficult issues of consistency away from the , usually simpler , context at hand .
an explicit ruling out of " all " conceivable inconsistencies ( paradoxes ) cannot be achieved for an axiomatic set theory anyway , due to gödel's second incompleteness theorem , so this does not at all hamper the utility of naïve set theory as compared to axiomatic set theory in the simple contexts considered below .
it merely simplifies the discussion .
consistency is henceforth taken for granted unless explicitly mentioned .
if " x " is a member of a set " a " , then it is also said that " x " belongs to " a " , or that " x " is in " a " .
this is denoted by " x" ∈ "a " .
the symbol ∈ is a derivation from the lowercase greek letter epsilon , " ε " , introduced by giuseppe peano in *num* and shall be the first letter of the word ἐστί ( means " is " ) .
the symbol ∉ is often used to write " x" ∉ "a " , meaning " x is not in a " .
two sets " a " and " b " are defined to be equal when they have precisely the same elements , that is , if every element of " a " is an element of " b " and every element of " b " is an element of " a " .
( see axiom of extensionality .
) thus a set is completely determined by its elements ; the description is immaterial .
for example , the set with elements *num* , *num* , and *num* is equal to the set of all prime numbers less than *num* .
if the sets " a " and " b " are equal , this is denoted symbolically as " a" = "b " ( as usual ) .
the empty set , often denoted ø and sometimes formula_1 , is a set with no members at all .
because a set is determined completely by its elements , there can be only one empty set .
( see axiom of empty set .
) although the empty set has no members , it can be a member of other sets .
thus ø ≠ {ø} , because the former has no members and the latter has one member .
in mathematics , the only sets with which one needs to be concerned can be built up from the empty set alone .
( ) the simplest way to describe a set is to list its elements between curly braces ( known as defining a set " extensionally " ) .
thus denotes the set whose only elements are and .
note the following points : ( these are consequences of the definition of equality in the previous section .
) this notation can be informally abused by saying something like to indicate the set of all dogs , but this example would usually be read by mathematicians as " the set containing the single element " dogs" " .
an extreme ( but correct ) example of this notation is , which denotes the empty set .
the notation , or sometimes , is used to denote the set containing all objects for which the condition holds ( known as defining a set " intensionally " ) .
for example , ∈ r} denotes the set of real numbers , denotes the set of everything with blonde hair .
this notation is called set-builder notation ( or " set comprehension " , particularly in the context of functional programming ) .
some variants of set builder notation are : given two sets " a " and " b " , " a " is a subset of " b " if every element of " a " is also an element of " b " .
in particular , each set " b " is a subset of itself ; a subset of " b " that is not equal to " b " is called a proper subset .
if " a " is a subset of " b " , then one can also say that " b " is a superset of " a " , that " a " is contained in " b " , or that " b " contains " a " .
in symbols , " a" ⊆ "b " means that " a " is a subset of " b " , and " b" ⊇ "a " means that " b " is a superset of " a " .
some authors use the symbols ⊂ and ⊃ for subsets , and others use these symbols only for " proper " subsets .
for clarity , one can explicitly use the symbols ⊊ and ⊋ to indicate non-equality .
as an illustration , let r be the set of real numbers , let z be the set of integers , let " o " be the set of odd integers , and let " p " be the set of current or former u .
s .
presidents .
then " o " is a subset of z , z is a subset of r , and ( hence ) " o " is a subset of r , where in all cases " subset " may even be read as " proper subset " .
note that not all sets are comparable in this way .
for example , it is not the case either that r is a subset of " p " nor that " p " is a subset of r .
it follows immediately from the definition of equality of sets above that , given two sets " a " and " b " , " a" = "b " if and only if " a" ⊆ "b " and " b" ⊆ "a " .
in fact this is often given as the definition of equality .
usually when trying to prove that two sets are equal , one aims to show these two inclusions .
note that the empty set is a subset of every set ( the statement that all elements of the empty set are also members of any set " a " is vacuously true ) .
the set of all subsets of a given set " a " is called the power set of " a " and is denoted by formula_2 or formula_3 ; the " "p" " is sometimes in a script font .
if the set " a " has " n " elements , then formula_3 will have formula_5 elements .
in certain contexts , one may consider all sets under consideration as being subsets of some given universal set .
for instance , when investigating properties of the real numbers r ( and subsets of r ) , r may be taken as the universal set .
a true universal set is not included in standard set theory ( see paradoxes below ) , but is included in some non-standard set theories .
given a universal set u and a subset " a " of u , the complement of " a " ( in u ) is defined as in other words , " a " ( " "a-complement" " ; sometimes simply " a , " "a-prime" " ) is the set of all members of u " ' which are not members of " a " .
thus with r , z and " o " defined as in the section on subsets , if z is the universal set , then " o " is the set of even integers , while if r is the universal set , then " o " is the set of all real numbers that are either even integers or not integers at all .
given two sets " a " and " b " , their union is the set consisting of all objects which are elements of " a " or of " b " or of both ( see axiom of union ) .
it is denoted by " a" ∪ "b " .
the intersection of " a " and " b " is the set of all objects which are both in " a " and in " b " .
it is denoted by " a" ∩ "b " .
finally , the relative complement of " b " relative to " a " , also known as the set theoretic difference of " a " and " b " , is the set of all objects that belong to " a " but " not " to " b " .
it is written as " a" \ "b " or " a" − "b " .
symbolically , these are respectively notice that " a " doesn't have to be a subset of " b " for " b" \ "a " to make sense ; this is the difference between the relative complement and the absolute complement ( " a " = " u" \ "a " ) from the previous section .
to illustrate these ideas , let " a " be the set of left-handed people , and let " b " be the set of people with blond hair .
then " a" ∩ "b " is the set of all left-handed blond-haired people , while " a" ∪ "b " is the set of all people who are left-handed or blond-haired or both .
" a" \ "b " , on the other hand , is the set of all people that are left-handed but not blond-haired , while " b" \ "a " is the set of all people who have blond hair but aren't left-handed .
now let " e " be the set of all human beings , and let " f " be the set of all living things over *num* years old .
what is " e" ∩ "f " in this case ? no living human being is over *num* years old , so " e" ∩ "f " must be the empty set {} .
for any set " a " , the power set formula_3 is a boolean algebra under the operations of union and intersection .
intuitively , an ordered pair is simply a collection of two objects such that one can be distinguished as the " first element " and the other as the " second element " , and having the fundamental property that , two ordered pairs are equal if and only if their " first elements " are equal and their " second elements " are equal .
formally , an ordered pair with first coordinate " a " , and second coordinate " b " , usually denoted by ( " a " , " b " ) , can be defined as the set / .
it follows that , two ordered pairs ( " a " , " b " ) and ( " c " , " d " ) are equal if and only if " a" = "c " and " b" = "d " .
alternatively , an ordered pair can be formally thought of as a set {a , b} with a total order .
( the notation ( " a " , " b " ) is also used to denote an open interval on the real number line , but the context should make it clear which meaning is intended .
otherwise , the notation ] " a " , " b " [ may be used to denote the open interval whereas ( " a " , " b " ) is used for the ordered pair ) .
if " a " and " b " are sets , then the cartesian product ( or simply product ) is defined to be : that is , " a" × "b " is the set of all ordered pairs whose first coordinate is an element of " a " and whose second coordinate is an element of " b " .
this definition may be extended to a set " a" × "b" × "c " of ordered triples , and more generally to sets of ordered n-tuples for any positive integer " n " .
it is even possible to define infinite cartesian products , but this requires a more recondite definition of the product .
cartesian products were first developed by rené descartes in the context of analytic geometry .
if r denotes the set of all real numbers , then r : = r × r represents the euclidean plane and r : = r × r × r represents three-dimensional euclidean space .
there are some ubiquitous sets that for which the notation is almost universal .
some of these are listed below .
in the list , " a " , " b " , and " c " refer natural numbers , and " r " and " s " are real numbers .
the unrestricted formation principle of sets referred to as the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension , is the source of several early appearing paradoxes : if the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension is weakened to the axiom schema of specification or axiom schema of separation , then all the above paradoxes disappear .
there is a corollary .
with the axiom schema of separation as an axiom of the theory , it follows , as a theorem of the theory : or , more spectacularly ( halmos ' phrasing ) : there is no universe .
" proof " : suppose that it exists and call it .
now apply the axiom schema of separation with and for use .
this leads to russell's paradox again .
hence can't exist in this theory .
related to the above constructions is formation of the set it is ( perhaps surprisingly ) not the possibility of that is problematic .
it is again the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension allowing for .
with the axiom schema of specification instead of unrestricted comprehension , the conclusion doesn't hold and , hence is not a logical consequence .
nonetheless , the possibility of is often removed explicitly or , e .
g .
in zfc , implicitly , by demanding the axiom of regularity to hold .
one consequence of it is or , in other words , no set is an element of itself .
the axiom schema of separation is simply too weak ( while unrestricted comprehension is a very strong axiom—too strong for set theory ) to develop set theory with its usual operations and constructions outlined above .
the axiom of regularity is of a restrictive nature as well .
therefore , one is led to the formulation of other axioms to guarantee the existence of enough sets to form a set theory .
some of these have been described informally above and many others are possible .
not all conceivable axioms can be combined freely into consistent theories .
for example , the axiom of choice of zfc is incompatible with the conceivable every set of reals is lebesgue measurable .
the former implies the latter is false .
douglas adams douglas noel adams ( *num* march *num* – *num* may *num* ) was an english author , scriptwriter , essayist , humorist , satirist and dramatist .
adams was author of " the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy " , which originated in *num* as a bbc radio comedy before developing into a " trilogy " of five books that sold more than *num* million copies in his lifetime and generated a television series , several stage plays , comics , a computer game , and in *num* a feature film .
adams's contribution to uk radio is commemorated in the radio academy's hall of fame .
adams also wrote " dirk gently's holistic detective agency " ( *num* ) and " the long dark tea-time of the soul " ( *num* ) , and co-wrote " the meaning of liff " ( *num* ) , " the deeper meaning of liff " ( *num* ) , " last chance to see " ( *num* ) , and three stories for the television series " doctor who " ; he also served as script editor for the show's seventeenth season in *num* .
a posthumous collection of his works , including an unfinished novel , was published as " the salmon of doubt " in *num* .
adams was an advocate for environmentalism and conservation , a lover of fast cars , technological innovation and the apple macintosh , and a self-proclaimed radical atheist .
adams was born on *num* march *num* to janet ( née donovan ; 1927–2016 ) and christopher douglas adams ( 1927–1985 ) in cambridge .
the family moved to the east end of london a few months after his birth , where his sister , susan , was born three years later .
his parents divorced in *num* ; douglas , susan , and their mother moved to an rspca animal shelter in brentwood , essex , run by his maternal grandparents .
adams attended primrose hill primary school in brentwood .
at nine , he passed the entrance exam for brentwood school .
he attended the prep school from *num* to *num* , then the main school until december *num* .
adams was by age *num* and stopped growing at .
his form master , frank halford , said adams's height had made him stand out and that he had been self-conscious about it .
his ability to write stories made him well known in the school .
he became the only student ever to be awarded a ten out of ten by halford for creative writing , something he remembered for the rest of his life , particularly when facing writer's block .
some of his earliest writing was published at the school , such as a report on its photography club in " the brentwoodian " in *num* , or spoof reviews in the school magazine " broadsheet " , edited by paul neil milne johnstone , who later became a character in " the hitchhiker's guide " .
he also designed the cover of one issue of the " broadsheet " , and had a letter and short story published in " the eagle " , the boys ' comic , in *num* .
a poem entitled " a dissertation on the task of writing a poem on a candle and an account of some of the difficulties thereto pertaining " written by adams in january *num* , at the age of *num* , was discovered in a cupboard at the school in early *num* .
on the strength of an essay on religious poetry that discussed the beatles and william blake , he was awarded an exhibition in english at st john's college , cambridge , going up in *num* .
he wanted to join the footlights , an invitation-only student comedy club that has acted as a hothouse for comic talent .
he was not elected immediately as he had hoped , and started to write and perform in revues with will adams ( no relation ) and martin smith , forming a group called " adams-smith-adams " , and became a member of the footlights by *num* .
despite doing very little work—he recalled having completed three essays in three years—he graduated in *num* with a b .
a .
in english literature .
after leaving university adams moved back to london , determined to break into tv and radio as a writer .
an edited version of the " footlights revue " appeared on bbc2 television in *num* .
a version of the revue performed live in london's west end led to adams being discovered by monty python's graham chapman .
the two formed a brief writing partnership , earning adams a writing credit in episode *num* of " monty python " for a sketch called " patient abuse " .
the pair also co-wrote the " marilyn monroe " sketch which appeared on the soundtrack album of " monty python and the holy grail " .
adams is one of only two people other than the original python members to get a writing credit ( the other being neil innes ) .
adams had two brief appearances in the fourth series of " monty python's flying circus " .
at the beginning of episode *num* , " the light entertainment war " , adams is in a surgeon's mask ( as dr .
emile koning , according to on-screen captions ) , pulling on gloves , while michael palin narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another but never gets started .
at the beginning of episode *num* , " mr .
neutron " , adams is dressed in a pepper-pot outfit and loads a missile onto a cart driven by terry jones , who is calling for scrap metal ( " any old iron .
.
.
" ) .
the two episodes were broadcast in november *num* .
adams and chapman also attempted non-python projects , including " out of the trees " .
at this point adams's career stalled ; his writing style was unsuited to the then-current style of radio and tv comedy .
to make ends meet he took a series of odd jobs , including as a hospital porter , barn builder , and chicken shed cleaner .
he was employed as a bodyguard by a qatari family , who had made their fortune in oil .
during this time adams continued to write and submit sketches , though few were accepted .
in *num* his career had a brief improvement when he wrote and performed " unpleasantness at brodie's close " at the edinburgh fringe festival .
by christmas , work had dried up again , and a depressed adams moved to live with his mother .
the lack of writing work hit him hard and low confidence became a feature of adams's life ; " i have terrible periods of lack of confidence [ .
.
] i briefly did therapy , but after a while i realised it was like a farmer complaining about the weather .
you can't fix the weather – you just have to get on with it " .
some of adams's early radio work included sketches for " the burkiss way " in *num* and " the news huddlines " .
he also wrote , again with chapman , *num* february *num* episode of " doctor on the go " , a sequel to the " doctor in the house " television comedy series .
after the first radio series of " the hitchhiker's guide " became successful , adams was made a bbc radio producer , working on " week ending " and a pantomime called " black cinderella two goes east " .
he left after six months to become the script editor for " doctor who " .
in *num* , adams and john lloyd wrote scripts for two half-hour episodes of " doctor snuggles " : " the remarkable fidgety river " and " the great disappearing mystery " ( episodes eight and twelve ) .
john lloyd was also co-author of two episodes from the original " hitchhiker " radio series ( " fit the fifth " and " fit the sixth " , also known as " episode five " and " episode six " ) , as well as " the meaning of liff " and " the deeper meaning of liff " .
adams sent the script for the " hhgg " pilot radio programme to the " doctor who " production office in *num* , and was commissioned to write " the pirate planet " .
he had also previously attempted to submit a potential movie script , called " doctor who and the krikkitmen " , which later became his novel " life , the universe and everything " ( which in turn became the third " hitchhiker's guide " radio series ) .
adams then went on to serve as script editor on the show for its seventeenth season in *num* .
altogether , he wrote three " doctor who " serials starring tom baker as the doctor : the episodes authored by adams are some of the few that were not novelised as adams would not allow anyone else to write them , and asked for a higher price than the publishers were willing to pay .
" shada " was later adapted as a novel by gareth roberts in *num* and " city of death " and " the pirate planet " by james goss in *num* and *num* respectively .
elements of " shada " and " city of death " were reused in adams's later novel " dirk gently's holistic detective agency " , in particular the character of professor chronotis .
big finish productions eventually remade " shada " as an audio play starring paul mcgann as the doctor .
accompanied by partially animated illustrations , it was webcast on the bbc website in *num* , and subsequently released as a two-cd set later that year .
an omnibus edition of this version was broadcast on the digital radio station bbc7 on *num* december *num* .
in the " doctor who " *num* christmas episode " the snowmen " , writer steven moffat was inspired by a storyline that adams pitched called " the doctor retires " .
"the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy " was a concept for a science-fiction comedy radio series pitched by adams and radio producer simon brett to bbc radio *num* in *num* .
adams came up with an outline for a pilot episode , as well as a few other stories ( reprinted in neil gaiman's book " " ) that could be used in the series .
according to adams , the idea for the title occurred to him while he lay drunk in a field in innsbruck , austria , gazing at the stars .
he was carrying a copy of the " hitch-hiker's guide to europe " , and it occurred to him that " somebody ought to write a " hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy" " .
despite the original outline , adams was said to make up the stories as he wrote .
he turned to john lloyd for help with the final two episodes of the first series .
lloyd contributed bits from an unpublished science fiction book of his own , called " gigax " .
very little of lloyd's material survived in later adaptations of " hitchhiker's " , such as the novels and the tv series .
the tv series was based on the first six radio episodes , and sections contributed by lloyd were largely re-written .
bbc radio *num* broadcast the first radio series weekly in the uk in march and april *num* .
the series was distributed in the united states by national public radio .
following the success of the first series , another episode was recorded and broadcast , which was commonly known as the christmas episode .
a second series of five episodes was broadcast one per night , during the week of 21–25 january *num* .
while working on the radio series ( and with simultaneous projects such as " the pirate planet " ) adams developed problems keeping to writing deadlines that got worse as he published novels .
adams was never a prolific writer and usually had to be forced by others to do any writing .
this included being locked in a hotel suite with his editor for three weeks to ensure that " so long , and thanks for all the fish " was completed .
he was quoted as saying , " i love deadlines .
i love the whooshing noise they make as they go by .
" despite the difficulty with deadlines , adams wrote five novels in the series , published in *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , and *num* .
the books formed the basis for other adaptations , such as three-part comic book adaptations for each of the first three books , an interactive text-adventure computer game , and a photo-illustrated edition , published in *num* .
this latter edition featured a *num* puzzle designed by adams , which was later incorporated into paperback covers of the first four " hitchhiker's " novels ( the paperback for the fifth re-used the artwork from the hardback edition ) .
in *num* , adams began attempts to turn the first " hitchhiker's " novel into a film , making several trips to los angeles , and working with hollywood studios and potential producers .
the next year , the radio series became the basis for a bbc television mini-series broadcast in six parts .
when he died in *num* in california , he had been trying again to get the movie project started with disney , which had bought the rights in *num* .
the screenplay got a posthumous re-write by karey kirkpatrick , and the resulting film was released in *num* .
radio producer dirk maggs had consulted with adams , first in *num* , and later in *num* and *num* about creating a third radio series , based on the third novel in the " hitchhiker's " series .
they also discussed the possibilities of radio adaptations of the final two novels in the five-book " trilogy " .
as with the movie , this project was realised only after adams's death .
the third series , " the tertiary phase " , was broadcast on bbc radio *num* in september *num* and was subsequently released on audio cd .
with the aid of a recording of his reading of " life , the universe and everything " and editing , adams can be heard playing the part of agrajag posthumously .
" so long , and thanks for all the fish " and " mostly harmless " made up the fourth and fifth radio series , respectively ( on radio they were titled " the quandary phase " and " the quintessential phase " ) and these were broadcast in may and june *num* , and also subsequently released on audio cd .
the last episode in the last series ( with a new , " more upbeat " ending ) concluded with , " the very final episode of " the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy " by douglas adams is affectionately dedicated to its author .
" between adams's first trip to madagascar with mark carwardine in *num* , and their series of travels that formed the basis for the radio series and non-fiction book " last chance to see " , adams wrote two other novels with a new cast of characters .
" dirk gently's holistic detective agency " was published in *num* , and was described by its author as " a kind of ghost-horror-detective-time-travel-romantic-comedy-epic , mainly concerned with mud , music and quantum mechanics " .
it was derived from two doctor who serials adams had written .
a sequel , " the long dark tea-time of the soul " , was published a year later .
this was an entirely original work , adams's first since " so long , and thanks for all the fish .
" after the book tour , adams set off on his round-the-world excursion which supplied him with the material for " last chance to see " .
adams played the guitar left-handed and had a collection of twenty-four left-handed guitars when he died ( having received his first guitar in *num* ) .
he also studied piano in the 1960s .
pink floyd and procol harum had important influence on adams ' work .
adams's official biography shares its name with the song " wish you were here " by pink floyd .
adams was friends with pink floyd guitarist david gilmour and , on adams's *ord* birthday , he was invited to make a guest appearance at pink floyd's concert of *num* october *num* at earls court in london , playing guitar on the songs " brain damage " and " eclipse " .
adams chose the name for pink floyd's *num* album , " the division bell " , by picking the words from the lyrics to one of its tracks , " high hopes " .
gilmour also performed at adams's memorial service in *num* , and what would have been adams's *ord* birthday party in *num* .
douglas adams created an interactive fiction version of " hhgg " with steve meretzky from infocom in *num* .
in *num* he participated in a week-long brainstorming session with the lucasfilm games team for the game " " .
later he was also involved in creating " bureaucracy " as a parody of events in his own life .
adams was a founder-director and chief fantasist of the digital village , a digital media and internet company with which he created " starship titanic " , a codie award-winning and bafta-nominated adventure game , which was published in *num* by simon & schuster .
terry jones wrote the accompanying book , entitled " douglas adams ' starship titanic " , since adams was too busy with the computer game to do both .
in april *num* , adams initiated the h2g2 collaborative writing project , an experimental attempt at making " the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy " a reality , and at harnessing the collective brainpower of the internet community .
it was hosted by bbc online from *num* to *num* .
in *num* , adams wrote and presented a television documentary programme " hyperland " which featured tom baker as a " software agent " ( similar to the assistant pictured in apple's knowledge navigator video of future concepts from *num* ) , and interviews with ted nelson , the co-inventor of hypertext and the person who coined the term .
adams was an early adopter and advocate of hypertext .
adams described himself as a " radical atheist " , adding " radical " for emphasis so he would not be asked if he meant agnostic .
he told american atheists that this conveyed the fact that he really meant it .
he imagined a sentient puddle who wakes up one morning and thinks , " this is an interesting world i find myself in – an interesting hole i find myself in – fits me rather neatly , doesn't it ? in fact it fits me staggeringly well , must have been made to have me in it ! " to demonstrate his view that the fine-tuned universe argument for god was a fallacy .
he remained fascinated by religion because of its effect on human affairs .
" i love to keep poking and prodding at it .
i've thought about it so much over the years that that fascination is bound to spill over into my writing .
" the evolutionary biologist and atheist richard dawkins uses adams's influence to exemplify arguments for non-belief in his *num* book " the god delusion " .
dawkins dedicated the book to adams , whom he jokingly called " possibly [ my ] only convert " to atheism and wrote on his death that " science has lost a friend , literature has lost a luminary , the mountain gorilla and the black rhino have lost a gallant defender .
" adams was also an environmental activist who campaigned on behalf of endangered species .
this activism included the production of the non-fiction radio series " last chance to see " , in which he and naturalist mark carwardine visited rare species such as the kakapo and baiji , and the publication of a tie-in book of the same name .
in *num* this was made into a cd-rom combination of audiobook , e-book and picture slide show .
adams and mark carwardine contributed the ' meeting a gorilla ' passage from " last chance to see " to the book " the great ape project " .
this book , edited by paola cavalieri and peter singer , launched a wider-scale project in *num* , which calls for the extension of moral equality to include all great apes , human and non-human .
in *num* , he participated in a climb of mount kilimanjaro while wearing a rhino suit for the british charity organisation save the rhino international .
puppeteer william todd-jones , who had originally worn the suit in the london marathon to raise money and bring awareness to the group , also participated in the climb wearing a rhino suit ; adams wore the suit while travelling to the mountain before the climb began .
about £100 , *num* was raised through that event , benefiting schools in kenya and a black rhinoceros preservation programme in tanzania .
adams was also an active supporter of the dian fossey gorilla fund .
since *num* , save the rhino has held an annual douglas adams memorial lecture around the time of his birthday to raise money for environmental campaigns .
adams bought his first word processor in *num* , having considered one as early as *num* .
his first purchase was a nexu .
in *num* , when he and jane belson went to los angeles , he bought a dec rainbow .
upon their return to england , adams bought an apricot , then a bbc micro and a tandy *num* .
in " last chance to see " adams mentions his cambridge z88 , which he had taken to zaire on a quest to find the northern white rhinoceros .
adams's posthumously published work , " the salmon of doubt " , features several articles by him on the subject of technology , including reprints of articles that originally ran in " macuser " magazine , and in " the independent on sunday " newspaper .
in these adams claims that one of the first computers he ever saw was a commodore pet , and that he had " adored " his apple macintosh ( " or rather my family of however many macintoshes it is that i've recklessly accumulated over the years " ) since he first saw one at infocom's offices in boston in *num* .
adams was a macintosh user from the time they first came out in *num* until his death in *num* .
he was the first person to buy a mac in europe , the second being stephen fry .
) .
adams was also an " apple master " , celebrities whom apple made into spokespeople for its products ( others included john cleese and gregory hines ) .
adams's contributions included a rock video that he created using the first version of imovie with footage featuring his daughter polly .
the video was available on adams's .
mac homepage .
adams installed and started using the first release of mac os x in the weeks leading up to his death .
his very last post to his own forum was in praise of mac os x and the possibilities of its cocoa programming framework .
he said it was " awesome .
.
.
" , which was also the last word he wrote on his site .
adams used email to correspond with steve meretzky in the early 1980s , during their collaboration on infocom's version of " the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy " .
while living in new mexico in *num* he set up another e-mail address and began posting to his own usenet newsgroup , alt .
fan .
douglas-adams , and occasionally , when his computer was acting up , to the comp .
sys .
mac hierarchy .
challenges to the authenticity of his messages later led adams to set up a message forum on his own website to avoid the issue .
in *num* , adams was a keynote speaker at the microsoft professional developers conference ( pdc ) where he described the personal computer as being a modelling device .
the video of his keynote speech is archived on channel *num* .
adams was also a keynote speaker for the april *num* embedded systems conference in san francisco , one of the major technical conferences on embedded system engineering .
adams moved to upper street , islington , in *num* and to duncan terrace , a few minutes ' walk away , in the late 1980s .
in the early 1980s adams had an affair with novelist sally emerson , who was separated from her husband at that time .
adams later dedicated his book " life , the universe and everything " to emerson .
in *num* emerson returned to her husband , peter stothard , a contemporary of adams's at brentwood school , and later editor of " the times " .
adams was soon introduced by friends to jane belson , with whom he later became romantically involved .
belson was the " lady barrister " mentioned in the jacket-flap biography printed in his books during the mid-1980s ( " he [ adams ] lives in islington with a lady barrister and an apple macintosh " ) .
the two lived in los angeles together during *num* while adams worked on an early screenplay adaptation of " hitchhiker's " .
when the deal fell through , they moved back to london , and after several separations ( " he is currently not certain where he lives , or with whom " ) and a broken engagement , they married on *num* november *num* .
adams and belson had one daughter together , polly jane rocket adams , born on *num* june *num* , shortly after adams turned *num* .
in *num* the family moved from london to santa barbara , california , where they lived until his death .
following the funeral , jane belson and polly adams returned to london .
belson died on *num* september *num* of cancer , aged *num* .
adams died of a heart attack on *num* may *num* , aged *num* , after resting from his regular workout at a private gym in montecito , california .
his funeral was held on *num* may in santa barbara .
his ashes were placed in highgate cemetery in north london in june *num* .
a memorial service was held on *num* september *num* at st martin-in-the-fields church , trafalgar square , london .
this became the first church service broadcast live on the web by the bbc .
two days before adams died , the minor planet center announced the naming of asteroid *num* arthurdent .
in *num* , the asteroid *num* douglasadams was named in his memory .
in may *num* , " the salmon of doubt " was published , containing many short stories , essays , and letters , as well as eulogies from richard dawkins , stephen fry ( in the uk edition ) , christopher cerf ( in the us edition ) , and terry jones ( in the us paperback edition ) .
it also includes eleven chapters of his unfinished novel , " the salmon of doubt " , which was originally intended to become a new dirk gently novel , but might have later become the sixth " hitchhiker " novel .
other events after adams's death included a webcast production of " shada " , allowing the complete story to be told , radio dramatisations of the final three books in the " hitchhiker's " series , and the completion of the film adaptation of " the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy " .
the film , released in *num* , posthumously credits adams as a producer , and several design elements – including a head-shaped planet seen near the end of the film – incorporated adams's features .
a 12-part radio series based on the dirk gently novels was announced in *num* .
bbc radio *num* also commissioned a third dirk gently radio series based on the incomplete chapters of " the salmon of doubt " , and written by kim fuller ; but this was dropped in favour of a bbc tv series based on the two completed novels .
a sixth " hitchhiker " novel , " and another thing .
.
.
" , by " artemis fowl " author eoin colfer , was released on *num* october *num* ( the *ord* anniversary of the first book ) , published with the support of adams's estate .
a bbc radio *num* " book at bedtime " adaptation and an audio book soon followed .
on *num* may *num* , two weeks after adams's death , his fans organised a tribute known as towel day , which has been observed every year since then .
in *num* , john lloyd presented an hour-long episode of the bbc radio four documentary " archive on *num* " , discussing adams ' private papers , which are held at st john's college , cambridge .
the episode is available online .
a street in são josé , santa catarina , brazil is named in adams ' honour .
false friend false friends are words in two languages that look or sound similar , but differ significantly in meaning .
an example is the english " embarrassed " and the spanish " embarazada " ( which means " pregnant " ) , or the word " sensible " , which means " reasonable " in english , but " sensitive " in french and spanish .
the term originates from a book by french linguists describing the phenomenon , which was translated in *num* and entitled , " false friend of a translator " .
as well as producing completely false friends , the use of loanwords often results in the use of a word in a restricted context , which may then develop new meanings not found in the original language .
for example , " angst " means " fear " in a general sense ( as well as " anxiety " ) in german , but when it was borrowed into english in the context of psychology , its meaning was restricted to a particular type of fear described as " a neurotic feeling of anxiety and depression " .
also , " gymnasium " meant both ' a place of education ' and ' a place for exercise ' in latin , but its meaning was restricted to the former in german and to the latter in english , making the expressions into false friends in those languages as well as in greek , where it started out as ' a place for naked exercise ' .
false friends , or bilingual homophones are words in two or more languages that look or sound similar , but differ significantly in meaning .
the origin of the term is as a shortened version of the expression " false friend of a translator " , the english translation of a french expression ( ) introduced by linguists maxime kœssler and jules derocquigny in their *num* book , " false friends , or the pitfalls of the english vocabulary " ( " les faux amis ou les trahisons du vocabulaire anglais " ) with a sequel , " autres mots anglais perfides " .
false friends can cause difficulty for people who might interpret a foreign text incorrectly .
students learning a foreign language , particularly one that is related to their native language , also have difficulty with false friends because students are likely to identify the words wrongly due to linguistic interference .
for this reason , teachers sometimes compile lists of false friends as an aid for their students .
from the etymological point of view , false friends can be created in several ways .
if language a borrowed a word from language b , or both borrowed the word from a third language or inherited it from a common ancestor , and later the word shifted in meaning or acquired additional meanings in at least one of these languages , a native speaker of one language will face a false friend when learning the other .
sometimes , presumably both senses were present in the common ancestor language , but the cognate words got different restricted senses in language a and language b .
"actual " , which in english is usually a synonym of " real " , has a different meaning in other european languages , in which it means ' current ' or ' up-to-date ' , and has the logical derivative as a verb , meaning ' to make current ' or ' to update ' .
" actualise " ( or ' actualize ' ) in english means ' to make a reality of ' .
the word " friend " itself has cognates in the other germanic languages ; but the scandinavian ones ( like swedish " frände " , danish " frænde " ) predominantly mean ' relative ' .
the original proto-germanic word meant simply ' someone whom one cares for ' and could therefore refer to both a friend and a relative , but lost various degrees of the ' friend ' sense in scandinavian languages , while it mostly lost the sense of ' relative ' in english .
( the plural " friends " is still rarely used for " kinsfolk " , as in the scottish proverb " friends agree best at a distance " , quoted in *num* .
) the estonian and finnish languages are closely related , which gives rise to false friends : or estonian " vaimu " ( spirit ; ghost ) and finnish " vaimo " ( wife ) , ; or estonian " huvitav " ( interesting ) and finnish " huvittava " ( amusing ) .
a high level of lexical similarity exists between german and dutch , but shifts in meaning of words with a shared etymology have in some instances resulted in ' bi-directional false friends ' : in belgium , similarities between dutch and french words often lead to confusion when several different meanings of the same word are mixed up and thus mistranslated .
in satirical sketch comedy " sois belge et tais-toi ! " , performed by joël riguelle in *num* , the following examples are given : the italian word " confetti " ( sugared almonds ) has acquired a new meaning in english , french and dutch ; in italian , the corresponding word is " coriandoli " .
english and spanish , both of which have borrowed from greek and latin , have multiple false friends .
english and japanese also have diverse false friends , many of them being " wasei-eigo " and " gairaigo " words .
in swedish , the word " rolig " means ' fun ' : " ett roligt skämt " ( " a funny joke " ) , while in the closely related languages danish and norwegian it means ' calm ' ( as in " he was calm despite all the commotion around him " ) .
however , the swedish original meaning of ' calm ' is retained in some related words such as " ro " , ' calmness ' , and " orolig " , ' worrisome , anxious ' , literally ' un-calm ' .
the danish and norwegian word " semester " means term ( as in school term ) , but the swedish word " semester " means holiday .
the danish word " frokost " means lunch , the norwegian word " frokost " means breakfast .
pseudo-anglicisms are new words formed from english morphemes independently from an analogous english construct and with a different intended meaning .
japanese is replete with pseudo-anglicisms , known as " wasei-eigo " ( " japan-made english " ) .
in bilingual situations , false friends often result in a semantic change—a real new meaning that is then commonly used in a language .
for example , the portuguese " humoroso " ( ' capricious ' ) changed its referent in american portuguese to ' humorous ' , owing to the english surface-cognate " humorous .
" "corn " was originally the dominant type of grain in a region ( indeed " corn " and " grain " are themselves cognates from the same indo-european root ) .
it came to mean usually cereals in general in the british isles in the nineteenth century , as in the corn laws , but maize in north america , and now often just maize also in the british isles .
the american italian " fattoria " lost its original meaning ' farm ' in favor of ' factory ' owing to the phonetically similar surface-cognate english " factory " ( cf .
standard italian " fabbrica " ' factory ' ) .
instead of the original " fattoria " , the phonetic adaptation american italian " farma " became the new signifier for ' farm ' ( weinreich *num* : *num* ; see " one-to-one correlation between signifiers and referents " ) .
this phenomenon is analyzed by ghil'ad zuckermann as " ( incestuous ) phono-semantic matching " .
edsac the electronic delay storage automatic calculator ( edsac ) was an early british computer .
inspired by john von neumann's seminal " first draft of a report on the edvac " , the machine was constructed by maurice wilkes and his team at the university of cambridge mathematical laboratory in england .
edsac was the second electronic digital stored-program computer to go into regular service .
later the project was supported by j .
lyons & co .
ltd .
, a british firm , who were rewarded with the first commercially applied computer , leo i , based on the edsac design .
work on edsac started during *num* , and it ran its first programs on *num* may *num* , when it calculated a table of square numbers and a list of prime numbers .
edsac *num* was finally shut down on *num* july *num* , having been superseded by edsac *num* , which remained in use until *num* .
as soon as edsac was operational , it began serving the university's research needs .
it used mercury delay lines for memory , and derated vacuum tubes for logic .
power consumption was *num* kw of electricity .
cycle time was *num* .
*num* ms for all ordinary instructions , *num* ms for multiplication .
input was via five-hole punched tape and output was via a teleprinter .
initially registers were limited to an accumulator and a multiplier register .
in *num* , david wheeler , returning from a stay at the university of illinois , designed an index register as an extension to the original edsac hardware .
a magnetic tape drive was added in *num* but never worked sufficiently well to be of real use .
until *num* , the available main memory ( instructions and data ) was only *num* 18-bit words , and there was no backing store .
the delay lines ( or " tanks " ) were arranged in two batteries providing *num* words each .
the second battery came into operation in *num* .
the full *ord* delay line store was not available until *num* or early *num* , limiting programs to about *num* words until then .
john lindley ( diploma student 1958–1959 ) mentioned " the incredible difficulty we had ever to produce a single correct piece of paper tape with the crude and unreliable home-made punching , printing and verifying gear available in the late 50s " .
the edsac's main memory consisted of *num* locations , though only *num* locations were initially installed .
each contained *num* bits , but the topmost bit was always unavailable due to timing problems , so only *num* bits were used .
an instruction consisted of a five-bit instruction code , one spare bit , a ten bit operand ( usually a memory address ) , and a length bit to control whether the instruction used a 17-bit or a 35-bit operand ( two consecutive words , little-endian ) .
all instruction codes were by design represented by one mnemonic letter , so that the " add " instruction , for example , used the edsac character code for the letter a .
internally , the edsac used two's complement , binary numbers .
numbers were either *num* bits ( one word ) or *num* bits ( two words ) long .
unusually , the multiplier was designed to treat numbers as fixed-point fractions in the range −1 ≤ " x " *num* , i .
e .
the binary point was immediately to the right of the sign .
the accumulator could hold *num* bits , including the sign , allowing two long ( 35-bit ) numbers to be multiplied without losing any precision .
the instructions available were : there was no division instruction ( but various division subroutines were supplied ) and no way to directly load a number into the accumulator ( a " store and zero accumulator " instruction followed by an " add " instruction were necessary for this ) .
there was no unconditional jump instruction , nor was there a procedure call instruction - it had not yet been invented .
maurice wilkes discussed relative addressing modes for the edsac in a paper published in *num* .
he was making the proposals to facilitate the use of subroutines .
the " initial orders " were hard-wired on a set of uniselector switches and loaded into the low words of memory at startup .
by may *num* , the initial orders provided a primitive relocating assembler taking advantage of the mnemonic design described above , all in *num* words .
this was the world's first assembler , and arguably the start of the global software industry .
there is a simulation of edsac available and a full description of the initial orders and first programs .
the first calculation done by edsac was a square number program run on *num* may *num* .
the program was written by beatrice worsley who had come from canada to study the machine .
the machine was used by other members of the university to solve real problems , and many early techniques were developed that are now included in operating systems .
users prepared their programs by punching them ( in assembler ) onto a paper tape .
they soon became good at being able to hold the paper tape up to the light and read back the codes .
when a program was ready it was hung on a length of line strung up near the paper tape reader .
the machine operators , who were present during the day , selected the next tape from the line and loaded it into edsac .
this is of course well known today as job queues .
if it printed something then the tape and the printout were returned to the user , otherwise they were informed at which memory location it had stopped .
debuggers were some time away , but a crt screen could be set to display the contents of a particular piece of memory .
this was used to see if a number was converging , for example .
a loudspeaker was connected to the accumulator's sign bit ; experienced users knew healthy and unhealthy sounds of programs , particularly programs ' hung ' in a loop .
after office hours certain " authorised users " were allowed to run the machine for themselves , which went on late into the night until a valve blew – which usually happened according to one such user .
the early programmers had to make use of techniques frowned upon today—especially altering the code .
as there was no index register until much later , the only way of accessing an array was to alter which memory location a particular instruction was referencing .
david wheeler , who earned the world's first computer science phd working on the project , is credited with inventing the concept of a subroutine .
users wrote programs that called a routine by jumping to the start of the subroutine with the return address ( i .
e .
the location-plus-one of the jump itself ) in the accumulator ( a wheeler jump ) .
by convention the subroutine expected this and the first thing it did was to modify its concluding jump instruction to that return address .
multiple and nested subroutines could be called so long as the user knew the length of each one in order to calculate the location to jump to ; recursive calls were forbidden .
the user then copied the code for the subroutine from a master tape onto their own tape following the end of their own program .
the subroutine concept led to the availability of a substantial subroutine library .
by *num* , *num* subroutines in the following categories were available for general use : floating point arithmetic ; arithmetic operations on complex numbers ; checking ; division ; exponentiation ; routines relating to functions ; differential equations ; special functions ; power series ; logarithms ; miscellaneous ; print and layout ; quadrature ; read ( input ) ; " n"th root ; trigonometric functions ; counting operations ( simulating repeat until loops , while loops and for loops ) ; vectors ; and matrices .
edsac's successor , edsac *num* , was commissioned in *num* .
in *num* , an edsac *num* version of autocode , an algol-like high-level programming language for scientists and engineers , was developed by david hartley .
in the mid-1960s , a successor to the edsac *num* was planned , but the move was instead made to the titan , a prototype atlas *num* developed from the atlas computer of the university of manchester , ferranti , and plessey .
on *num* january *num* , the computer conservation society announced that it planned to build a working replica of edsac , at the national museum of computing ( tnmoc ) in bletchley park supervised by andrew herbert , who studied under maurice wilkes .
the first parts of the recreation were switched on in november *num* .
the ongoing project is open to visitors of the museum .
as of november *num* , commissioning of the fully completed and operational state of the replica was estimated to be the autumn of *num* .
however , project delays have postponed its opening ( as of may *num* ) to summer of *num* .
elias canetti elias canetti ( ; ; *num* july *num* – *num* august *num* ) was a german-language author , born in ruse , bulgaria to a merchant family .
they moved to manchester , england , but his father died in *num* , and his mother took her three sons back to the continent .
they settled in vienna .
canetti moved to england in *num* after the anschluss to escape nazi persecution .
he became a british citizen in *num* .
he is known as a modernist novelist , playwright , memoirist , and non-fiction writer .
he won the nobel prize in literature in *num* , " for writings marked by a broad outlook , a wealth of ideas and artistic power " .
he is noted for his non-fiction book " crowds and power " , among other works .
born in *num* to businessman jacques canetti and mathilde " née " arditti in ruse , a city on the danube in bulgaria , canetti was the eldest of three sons .
his ancestors were sephardi jews .
his paternal ancestors settled in ruse from ottoman adrianople .
the original family name was " cañete " , named after cañete , cuenca , a village in spain .
in ruse , canetti's father and grandfather were successful merchants who operated out of a commercial building , which they had built in *num* .
canetti's mother descended from the arditti family , one of the oldest sephardi families in bulgaria , who were among the founders of the ruse jewish colony in the late *ord* century .
the ardittis can be traced to the *ord* century , when they were court physicians and astronomers to the aragonese royal court of alfonso iv and pedro iv .
before settling in ruse , they had migrated into italy and lived in livorno in the *ord* century .
canetti spent his childhood years , from *num* to *num* , in ruse until the family moved to manchester , england , where canetti's father joined a business established by his wife's brothers .
in *num* , his father died suddenly , and his mother moved with their children first to lausanne , then vienna in the same year .
they lived in vienna from the time canetti was aged seven onwards .
his mother insisted that he speak german , and taught it to him .
by this time canetti already spoke ladino ( his native language ) , bulgarian , english , and some french ; the latter two he studied in the one year they were in britain .
subsequently the family moved first ( from *num* to *num* ) to zürich and then ( until *num* ) to frankfurt , where canetti graduated from high school .
canetti went back to vienna in *num* in order to study chemistry .
however , his primary interests during his years in vienna became philosophy and literature .
introduced into the literary circles of first-republic-vienna , he started writing .
politically leaning towards the left , he was present at the july revolt of *num* – he came near to the action accidentally , was most impressed by the burning of books ( recalled frequently in his writings ) , and left the place quickly with his bicycle .
he gained a degree in chemistry from the university of vienna in *num* , but never worked as a chemist .
he published two works in vienna before escaping to great britain .
he reflected the experiences of nazi germany and political chaos in his works , especially exploring mob action and group thinking in his novel " die blendung " ( " auto-da-fé " , *num* ) and non-fiction " crowds and power " ( *num* ) .
he wrote several volumes of memoirs , contemplating the influence of his multi-lingual background and childhood .
in *num* in vienna he married veza ( venetiana ) taubner-calderon ( 1897–1963 ) , who acted as his muse and devoted literary assistant .
canetti remained open to relationships with other women .
in *num* , after the " anschluss " with germany , the canetti couple moved to london .
he became closely involved with the painter marie-louise von motesiczky , who was to remain a close companion for many years .
his name has also been linked with the author iris murdoch ( see john bayley's " iris , a memoir of iris murdoch " , which has several references to an author , referred to as " the dichter " , who was a nobel laureate and whose works included " die blendung " [ english title " auto-da-fé " ] ) .
after veza died in *num* , canetti married hera buschor ( 1933–1988 ) , with whom he had a daughter , johanna , in *num* .
canetti's brother jacques canetti settled in paris , where he championed a revival of french chanson .
despite being a german-language writer , canetti settled in britain until the 1970s , receiving british citizenship in *num* .
for his last *num* years , canetti lived mostly in zürich .
a writer in german , canetti won the nobel prize in literature in *num* , " for writings marked by a broad outlook , a wealth of ideas and artistic power " .
he is known chiefly for his celebrated trilogy of autobiographical memoirs of his childhood and of pre-anschluss vienna : " die gerettete zunge " ( the tongue set free ) ; " die fackel im ohr " ( the torch in my ear ) , and " das augenspiel " ( the play of the eyes ) ; for his modernist novel " auto-da-fé " ( " die blendung " ) ; and for " crowds and power " , a psychological study of crowd behaviour as it manifests itself in human activities ranging from mob violence to religious congregations .
in the 1970s , canetti began to travel more frequently to zurich , where he settled and lived for his last *num* years .
he died in zürich in *num* .
espionage espionage or spying , is the act of obtaining secret or confidential information without the permission of the holder of the information .
spies help agencies uncover secret information .
any individual or spy ring ( a cooperating group of spies ) , in the service of a government , company or independent operation , can commit espionage .
the practice is clandestine , as it is by definition unwelcome and in many cases illegal and punishable by law .
espionage is a method of " intelligence " gathering which includes information gathering from public sources .
espionage is often part of an institutional effort by a government or commercial concern .
however , the term tends to be associated with state spying on potential or actual enemies for military purposes .
spying involving corporations is known as industrial espionage .
one of the most effective ways to gather data and information about the enemy ( or potential enemy ) is by infiltrating the enemy's ranks .
this is the job of the spy ( espionage agent ) .
spies can return information concerning the size and strength of enemy forces .
they can also find dissidents within the enemy's forces and influence them to defect .
in times of crisis , spies steal technology and sabotage the enemy in various ways .
counterintelligence is the practice of thwarting enemy espionage and intelligence-gathering .
almost all nations have strict laws concerning espionage and the penalty for being caught is often severe .
however , the benefits gained through espionage are often so great that most governments and many large corporations make use of it .
information collection techniques used in the conduct of clandestine human intelligence include operational techniques , asset recruiting , and tradecraft .
today , espionage agencies target the illegal drug trade and terrorists as well as state actors .
since *num* , the united states has charged at least *num* defendants for attempting to spy for china .
intelligence services value certain intelligence collection techniques over others .
the former soviet union , for example , preferred human sources over research in open sources , while the united states has tended to emphasize technological methods such as sigint and imint .
in the soviet union , both political ( kgb ) and military intelligence ( gru ) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited .
espionage agents are usually trained experts in a targeted field so they can differentiate mundane information from targets of value to their own organizational development .
correct identification of the target at its execution is the sole purpose of the espionage operation .
broad areas of espionage targeting expertise include : although the news media may speak of " spy satellites " and the like , espionage is not a synonym for all intelligence-gathering disciplines .
it is a specific form of human source intelligence ( humint ) .
codebreaking ( cryptanalysis or comint ) , aircraft or satellite photography , ( imint ) and research in open publications ( osint ) are all intelligence gathering disciplines , but none of them is considered espionage .
many humint activities , such as prisoner interrogation , reports from military reconnaissance patrols and from diplomats , etc .
, are not considered espionage .
espionage is the disclosure of sensitive information ( classified ) to people who are not cleared for that information or access to that sensitive information .
unlike other forms of intelligence collection disciplines , espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge .
there are exceptions to physical meetings , such as the oslo report , or the insistence of robert hanssen in never meeting the people who bought his information .
the us defines espionage towards itself as " the act of obtaining , delivering , transmitting , communicating , or receiving information about the national defense with an intent , or reason to believe , that the information may be used to the injury of the united states or to the advantage of any foreign nation " .
" black's law dictionary " ( *num* ) defines espionage as : " .
.
.
gathering , transmitting , or losing .
.
.
information related to the national defense " .
espionage is a violation of united states law , and article 106a of the uniform code of military justice " .
the united states , like most nations , conducts espionage against other nations , under the control of the national clandestine service .
britain's espionage activities are controlled by the secret intelligence service .
a spy is a person employed to seek out top secret information from a source .
within the united states intelligence community , " asset " is a more common usage .
a case officer or special agent , who may have diplomatic status ( i .
e .
, official cover or non-official cover ) , supports and directs the human collector .
cutouts are couriers who do not know the agent or case officer but transfer messages .
a safe house is a refuge for spies .
spies often seek to obtain secret information from another source .
in larger networks the organization can be complex with many methods to avoid detection , including clandestine cell systems .
often the players have never met .
case officers are stationed in foreign countries to recruit and to supervise intelligence agents , who in turn spy on targets in their countries where they are assigned .
a spy need not be a citizen of the target country—hence does not automatically commit treason when operating within it .
while the more common practice is to recruit a person already trusted with access to sensitive information , sometimes a person with a well-prepared synthetic identity ( cover background ) , called a " legend " in tradecraft , may attempt to infiltrate a target organization .
these agents can be moles ( who are recruited before they get access to secrets ) , defectors ( who are recruited after they get access to secrets and leave their country ) or defectors in place ( who get access but do not leave ) .
a " legend " is also employed for an individual who " is not " an illegal agent , but is an ordinary citizen who is " relocated " , for example , a " protected witness " .
nevertheless , such a non-agent very likely will also have a case officer who will act as controller .
as in most , if not all synthetic identity schemes , for whatever purpose ( illegal or legal ) , the assistance of a controller is required .
spies may also be used to spread disinformation in the organization in which they are planted , such as giving false reports about their country's military movements , or about a competing company's ability to bring a product to market .
spies may be given other roles that also require infiltration , such as sabotage .
many governments spy on their allies as well as their enemies , although they typically maintain a policy of not commenting on this .
governments also employ private companies to collect information on their behalf such as scg international risk , international intelligence limited and others .
many organizations , both national and non-national , conduct espionage operations .
it should not be assumed that espionage is always directed at the most secret operations of a target country .
national and terrorist organizations and other groups are also targets .
this is because governments want to retrieve information that they can use to be proactive in protecting their nation from potential terrorist attacks .
communications both are necessary to espionage and clandestine operations , and also a great vulnerability when the adversary has sophisticated sigint detection and interception capability .
agents must also transfer money securely .
reportedly canada is losing $12 billion and german companies are estimated to be losing about €50 billion ( $87 billion ) and *num* , *num* jobs to industrial espionage every year .
in espionage jargon , an " agent " is the person who does the spying ; a citizen of one country who is recruited by a second country to spy on or work against his own country or a third country .
in popular usage , this term is often erroneously applied to a member of an intelligence service who recruits and handles agents ; in espionage such a person is referred to as an " intelligence officer " , " intelligence operative " or " case officer " .
there are several types of agent in use today : espionage is a crime under the legal code of many nations .
in the united states it is covered by the espionage act of *num* .
the risks of espionage vary .
a spy breaking the host country's laws may be deported , imprisoned , or even executed .
a spy breaking their own country's laws can be imprisoned for espionage or / and treason ( which in the us and some other jurisdictions can only occur if they take up arms or aids the enemy against their own country during wartime ) , or even executed , as the rosenbergs were .
for example , when aldrich ames handed a stack of dossiers of u .
s .
central intelligence agency ( cia ) agents in the eastern bloc to his kgb-officer " handler " , the kgb " rolled up " several networks , and at least ten people were secretly shot .
when ames was arrested by the u .
s .
federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) , he faced life in prison ; his contact , who had diplomatic immunity , was declared " persona non grata " and taken to the airport .
ames ' wife was threatened with life imprisonment if her husband did not cooperate ; he did , and she was given a five-year sentence .
hugh francis redmond , a cia officer in china , spent nineteen years in a chinese prison for espionage—and died there—as he was operating without diplomatic cover and immunity .
in united states law , treason , espionage , and spying are separate crimes .
treason and espionage have graduated punishment levels .
the united states in world war i passed the espionage act of *num* .
over the years , many spies , such as the soble spy ring , robert lee johnson , the rosenberg ring , aldrich hazen ames , robert philip hanssen , jonathan pollard , john anthony walker , james hall iii , and others have been prosecuted under this law .
from ancient times , the penalty for espionage in many countries was execution .
this was true right up until the era of world war ii ; for example , josef jakobs was a nazi spy who parachuted into great britain in *num* and was executed for espionage .
in modern times , many people convicted of espionage have been given penal sentences rather than execution .
for example , aldrich hazen ames is an american cia analyst , turned kgb mole , who was convicted of espionage in *num* ; he is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole in the high-security allenwood u .
s .
penitentiary .
ames was formerly a 31-year cia counterintelligence officer and analyst who committed espionage against his country by spying for the soviet union and russia .
so far as it is known , ames compromised the second-largest number of cia agents , second only to robert hanssen , who is also serving a prison sentence .
espionage laws are also used to prosecute non-spies .
in the united states , the espionage act of *num* was used against socialist politician eugene v .
debs ( at that time the act had much stricter guidelines and amongst other things banned speech against military recruiting ) .
the law was later used to suppress publication of periodicals , for example of father coughlin in world war ii .
in the early *ord* century , the act was used to prosecute whistleblowers such as thomas andrews drake , john kiriakou , and edward snowden , as well as officials who communicated with journalists for innocuous reasons , such as stephen jin-woo kim .
, india and pakistan were holding several hundred prisoners of each other's country for minor violations like trespass or visa overstay , often with accusations of espionage attached .
some of these include cases where pakistan and india both deny citizenship to these people , leaving them stateless .
the bbc reported in *num* on one such case , that of mohammed idrees , who was held under indian police control for approximately *num* years for overstaying his 15-day visa by 2–3 days after seeing his ill parents in *num* .
much of the *num* years was spent in prison waiting for a hearing , and more time was spent homeless or living with generous families .
the indian people's union for civil liberties and human rights law network both decried his treatment .
the bbc attributed some of the problems to tensions caused by the kashmir conflict .
espionage is illegal in the uk under the official secrets acts of *num* and *num* .
the uk law under this legislation considers espionage as " concerning those who intend to help an enemy and deliberately harm the security of the nation " .
according to mi5 , a person commits the offence of ' spying ' if they , " for any purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the state " : approaches , enters or inspects a prohibited area ; makes documents such as plans that are intended , calculated , or could directly or indirectly be of use to an enemy ; or " obtains , collects , records , or publishes , or communicates to any other person any secret official code word , or pass word , or any sketch , plan , model , article , or note , or other document which is calculated to be or might be or is intended to be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy " .
the illegality of espionage also includes any action which may be considered ' preparatory to ' spying , or encouraging or aiding another to spy .
an individual convicted of espionage can be imprisoned for up to *num* years in the uk , although multiple sentences can be issued .
government intelligence is very much distinct from espionage , and is not illegal in the uk , providing that the organisations of individuals are registered , often with the ico , and are acting within the restrictions of the regulation of investigatory powers act ( ripa ) .
' intelligence ' is considered legally as " information of all sorts gathered by a government or organisation to guide its decisions .
it includes information that may be both public and private , obtained from many different public or secret sources .
it could consist entirely of information from either publicly available or secret sources , or be a combination of the two .
" however , espionage and intelligence can be linked .
according to the mi5 website , " foreign intelligence officers acting in the uk under diplomatic cover may enjoy immunity from prosecution .
such persons can only be tried for spying ( or , indeed , any criminal offence ) if diplomatic immunity is waived beforehand .
those officers operating without diplomatic cover have no such immunity from prosecution " .
there are also laws surrounding government and organisational intelligence and surveillance .
generally , the body involved should be issued with some form of warrant or permission from the government , and should be enacting their procedures in the interest of protecting national security or the safety of public citizens .
those carrying out intelligence missions should act within not only ripa , but also the data protection act and human rights act .
however , there are spy equipment laws and legal requirements around intelligence methods that vary for each form of intelligence enacted .
in military conflicts , espionage is considered permissible as many nations recognize the inevitability of opposing sides seeking intelligence each about the dispositions of the other .
to make the mission easier and successful , soldiers or agents wear disguises to conceal their true identity from the enemy while penetrating enemy lines for intelligence gathering .
however , if they are caught behind enemy lines in disguises , they are not entitled to prisoner-of-war status and subject to prosecution and punishment—including execution .
the hague convention of *num* addresses the status of wartime spies , specifically within " laws and customs of war on land " ( hague iv ) ; october *num* , *num* : chapter ii spies " .
article *num* states that a person is considered a spy who , acts clandestinely or on false pretenses , infiltrates enemy lines with the intention of acquiring intelligence about the enemy and communicate it to the belligerent during times of war .
soldiers who penetrate enemy lines in proper uniforms for the purpose of acquiring intelligence are not considered spies but are lawful combatants entitled to be treated as prisoners of war upon capture by the enemy .
article *num* states that a spy captured behind enemy lines may only be punished following a trial .
however , article *num* provides that if a spy successfully rejoined his own military and is then captured by the enemy as a lawful combatant , he cannot be punished for his previous acts of espionage and must be treated as a prisoner of war .
note that this provision does not apply to citizens who committed treason against their own country or co-belligerents of that country and may be captured and prosecuted at any place or any time regardless whether he rejoined the military to which he belongs or not or during or after the war .
the ones that are excluded from being treated as spies while behind enemy lines are escaping prisoners of war and downed airmen as international law distinguishes between a disguised spy and a disguised escaper .
it is permissible for these groups to wear enemy uniforms or civilian clothes in order to facilitate their escape back to friendly lines so long as they do not attack enemy forces , collect military intelligence , or engage in similar military operations while so disguised .
soldiers who are wearing enemy uniforms or civilian clothes simply for the sake of warmth along with other purposes rather than engaging in espionage or similar military operations while so attired are also excluded from being treated as unlawful combatants .
saboteurs are treated as spies as they too wear disguises behind enemy lines for the purpose of waging destruction on an enemy's vital targets in addition to intelligence gathering .
for example , during world war ii , eight german agents entered the u .
s .
in june *num* as part of operation pastorius , a sabotage mission against u .
s .
economic targets .
two weeks later , all were arrested in civilian clothes by the fbi thanks to two german agents betraying the mission to the u .
s .
under the hague convention of *num* , these germans were classified as spies and tried by a military tribunal in washington d .
c .
on august *num* , *num* , all eight were found guilty and sentenced to death .
five days later , six were executed by electric chair at the district of columbia jail .
two who had given evidence against the others had their sentences reduced by president franklin d .
roosevelt to prison terms .
in *num* , they were released by president harry s .
truman and deported to the american zone of occupied germany .
the u .
s .
codification of enemy spies is article *num* of the uniform code of military justice .
this provides a mandatory death sentence if a person captured in the act is proven to be " lurking as a spy or acting as a spy in or about any place , vessel , or aircraft , within the control or jurisdiction of any of the armed forces , or in or about any shipyard , any manufacturing or industrial plant , or any other place or institution engaged in work in aid of the prosecution of the war by the united states , or elsewhere " .
spies have long been favorite topics for novelists and film makers .
an early example of espionage literature is " kim " by the english novelist rudyard kipling , with a description of the training of an intelligence agent in the great game between the uk and russia in *ord* century central asia .
an even earlier work was james fenimore cooper's classic novel , " the spy , " written in *num* , about an american spy in new york during the revolutionary war .
during the many *ord* century spy scandals , much information became publicly known about national spy agencies and dozens of real-life secret agents .
these sensational stories piqued public interest in a profession largely off-limits to human interest news reporting , a natural consequence of the secrecy inherent in their work .
to fill in the blanks , the popular conception of the secret agent has been formed largely by *ord* and *ord* century fiction and film .
attractive and sociable real-life agents such as valerie plame find little employment in serious fiction , however .
the fictional secret agent is more often a loner , sometimes amoral—an existential hero operating outside the everyday constraints of society .
loner spy personalities may have been a stereotype of convenience for authors who already knew how to write loner private investigator characters that sold well from the 1920s to the present .
johnny fedora achieved popularity as a fictional agent of early cold war espionage , but james bond is the most commercially successful of the many spy characters created by intelligence insiders during that struggle .
his less fantastic rivals include le carre's george smiley and harry palmer as played by michael caine .
jumping on the spy bandwagon , other writers also started writing about spy fiction featuring female spies as protagonists , such as " the baroness " , which has more graphic action and sex , as compared to other novels featuring male protagonists .
it also made its way into the videogame world , hence the famous creation of hideo kojima , the " metal gear solid " series .
espionage has also made its way into comedy depictions .
the 1960s tv series " get smart " portrays an inept spy , while the *num* movie " spies like us " depicts a pair of none-too-bright men sent to the soviet union to investigate a missile .
god save the queen "god save the queen " ( alternatively " god save the king " , depending on the gender of the reigning monarch ) is the national or royal anthem in a number of commonwealth realms , their territories , and the british crown dependencies .
the author of the tune is unknown , and it may originate in plainchant ; but an attribution to the composer john bull is sometimes made .
"god save the queen " is the national anthem of the united kingdom and one of two national anthems used by new zealand since *num* , as well as for several of the uk's territories that have their own additional local anthem .
it is also the royal anthem – played specifically in the presence of the monarch – of all the aforementioned countries , as well as australia ( since *num* ) , canada ( since *num* ) , barbados and tuvalu .
in countries not previously part of the british empire , the tune of " god save the queen " has provided the basis for various patriotic songs , though still generally connected with royal ceremony .
the melody continues to be used for the national anthem of liechtenstein , " oben am jungen rhein " , and the royal anthem of norway , " kongesangen " .
in the united states , the melody is used for the patriotic song " my country , ' tis of thee " .
beyond its first verse , which is consistent , " god save the queen / king " has many historic and extant versions .
since its first publication , different verses have been added and taken away and , even today , different publications include various selections of verses in various orders .
in general , only one verse is sung .
sometimes two verses are sung , and on rare occasions , three .
the sovereign and her or his spouse are saluted with the entire composition , while other members of the royal family who are entitled to royal salute ( such as the prince of wales , duke of cambridge and duke of sussex along with their spouses ) receive just the first six bars .
the first six bars also form all or part of the vice regal salute in some commonwealth realms outside the uk ( e .
g .
, in canada , governors general and lieutenant governors at official events are saluted with the first six bars of " god save the queen " followed by the first four and last four bars of " o canada " ) , as well as the salute given to governors of british overseas territories .
in " the oxford companion to music " , percy scholes points out the similarities to an early plainsong melody , although the rhythm is very distinctly that of a galliard , and he gives examples of several such dance tunes that bear a striking resemblance to " god save the king / queen " .
scholes quotes a keyboard piece by john bull ( *num* ) which has some similarities to the modern tune , depending on the placing of accidentals which at that time were unwritten in certain cases and left to the discretion of the player ( see " musica ficta " ) .
he also points to several pieces by henry purcell , one of which includes the opening notes of the modern tune , setting the words " god save the king " .
nineteenth-century scholars and commentators mention the widespread belief that an old scots carol , " remember o thou man " was the source of the tune .
the first published version of what is almost the present tune appeared in *num* in " thesaurus musicus " .
the *num* version of the song was popularised in scotland and england the following year , with the landing of charles edward stuart and was published in " the gentleman's magazine " ( see illustration above ) .
this manuscript has the tune depart from that which is used today at several points , one as early as the first bar , but is otherwise clearly a strong relative of the contemporary anthem .
it was recorded as being sung in london theatres in *num* , with , for example , thomas arne writing a setting of the tune for the drury lane theatre .
scholes ' analysis includes mention of " untenable " and " doubtful " claims , as well as " an american misattribution " .
some of these are : scholes recommends the attribution " traditional " or " traditional ; earliest known version by john bull ( 1562–1628 ) " .
the " english hymnal " ( musical editor ralph vaughan williams ) gives no attribution , stating merely " *ord* or *ord* cent .
" save great george our king god save our noble king , god save the king ! send him victorious happy and glorious long to reign over us god save the king ! / like many aspects of british constitutional life , " god save the queen " derives its official status from custom and use , not from royal proclamation or act of parliament .
the variation in the uk of the lyrics to " god save the queen " is the oldest amongst those currently used , and forms the basis on which all other versions used throughout the commonwealth are formed ; though , again , the words have varied over time .
england has no official national anthem of its own ; " god save the queen " is treated as the english national anthem when england is represented at sporting events ( though there are some exceptions to this rule , such as cricket where " jerusalem " is used ) .
there is a movement to establish an english national anthem , with blake and parry's " jerusalem " and elgar's " land of hope and glory " among the top contenders .
scotland has its own national song and wales has its own national anthem for political and national events and for use at international football , rugby union and other sports in which those nations compete independently .
on all occasions wales ' national anthem is " hen wlad fy nhadau " ( land of my fathers ) .
scotland has no single anthem ; " scotland the brave " was traditionally used until the 1990s , when " flower of scotland " was adopted .
in northern ireland , " god save the queen " is still used as the official anthem .
the phrase " no surrender " is occasionally sung in the bridge before " send her victorious " by england football fans at matches .
the phrase " no surrender " is also associated with combat *num* , a white supremacist group .
the phrase is also associated with ulster loyalism and can sometimes be heard at the same point before northern ireland football matches .
since *num* , " god save the queen " , considered an all inclusive anthem for great britain and northern ireland , as well as other countries within the commonwealth , has been dropped from the commonwealth games .
northern irish athletes receive their gold medals to the tune of the " londonderry air " , popularly known as " danny boy " .
in *num* , english winners heard elgar's pomp and circumstance march no .
*num* , usually known as " land of hope and glory " , but after a poll conducted by the commonwealth games council for england prior to the *num* games , " jerusalem " was adopted as england's new commonwealth games anthem .
in sports in which the uk competes as one nation , most notably as great britain at the olympics , " god save the queen " is used to represent anyone or any team that comes from the united kingdom .
the phrase " god save the king " is much older than the song , appearing , for instance , several times in the king james bible .
a text based on the *ord* book of kings chapter *num* : verses 38–40 , " .
.
.
and all the people rejoic'd , and said : god save the king ! long live the king ! may the king live for ever , amen " , has been sung at every coronation since that of king edgar in *num* .
scholes says that as early as *num* " god save the king " was a watchword of the royal navy , with the response being " long to reign over us " .
he also notes that the prayer read in churches on anniversaries of the gunpowder plot includes words which might have formed part of the basis for the second verse " scatter our enemies .
.
.
assuage their malice and confound their devices " .
in *num* , " the gentleman's magazine " published " god save our lord the king : a new song set for two voices " , describing it " as sung at both playhouses " ( the theatres royal at drury lane and covent garden ) .
traditionally , the first performance was thought to have been in *num* , when it was sung in support of king george ii , after his defeat at the battle of prestonpans by the army of charles edward stuart , son of james francis edward stuart , the jacobite claimant to the british throne .
it is sometimes claimed that , ironically , the song was originally sung in support of the jacobite cause : the word " send " in the line " send him victorious " could imply that the king was absent .
however , the " oxford english dictionary " cites examples of " [ god ] send ( a person ) safe , victorious , etc .
" meaning " god grant that he may be safe , etc .
" .
there are also examples of early eighteenth century jacobean drinking glasses which are inscribed with a version of the words and were apparently intended for drinking the health of king james ii and vii .
scholes acknowledges these possibilities but argues that the same words were probably being used by both jacobite and hanoverian supporters and directed at their respective kings .
in *num* , the musician william hayman cummings , quoting *ord* century correspondence between charles burney and sir joseph banks , proposed that the words were based on a latin verse composed for king james ii at the chapel royal .
there is no definitive version of the lyrics .
however , the version consisting of the three verses reproduced in the box on the right hand side has the best claim to be regarded as the " standard " british version , appearing not only in the *num* " gentleman's magazine " , but also in publications such as " the book of english songs : from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century " ( *num* ) , " national hymns : how they are written and how they are not written " ( *num* ) , " household book of poetry " ( *num* ) , and " hymns ancient and modern , revised version " ( *num* ) .
the same version with verse two omitted appears in publications including " scouting for boys " ( *num* ) , and on the british monarchy website .
at the queen's golden jubilee party at the palace concert , prince charles referred in his speech to the " politically incorrect second verse " of the national anthem .
according to alan michie's " rule , britannia " , which was published in *num* , after the death of king george vi but before the coronation of queen elizabeth ii , when the first general assembly of the united nations was held in london in january *num* the king , in honour of the occasion , " ordered the belligerent imperious second stanza of ' god save the king ' to be rewritten to bring it more into the spirit of the brotherhood of nations .
" in the uk , the first verse is the only verse typically sung , even at official occasions , although the third verse is sung in addition on rare occasions such as during the opening ceremonies of the *num* summer olympics and *num* summer paralympics , and usually at the last night of the proms .
at the closing ceremony of the *num* beijing olympics , the fourth verse of the william hickson alternative lyrics was sung instead of the third verse .
the standard version of the melody and its key of g major are still those of the originally published version , although the start of the anthem is often signalled by an introductory timpani roll of two bars length .
the bass line of the standard version differs little from the second voice part shown in the original , and there is a standard version in four-part harmony for choirs .
the first three lines ( six bars of music ) are soft , ending with a short " crescendo " into " send her victorious " , and then is another " crescendo " at " over us : " into the final words " god save the queen " .
in the early part of the *ord* century there existed a military band version in the higher key of b , because it was easier for brass instruments to play in that key , though it had the disadvantage of being more difficult to sing : however now most bands play it in the correct key of g .
since *num* , the anthem is sometimes preceded by a fanfare composed by gordon jacob for the coronation of queen elizabeth ii .
there have been several attempts to improve the song by rewriting the words .
in the nineteenth century there was some lively debate about the national anthem and , even then , verse two was considered to be slightly offensive .
notably , the question arose over the phrase " scatter her enemies .
" some thought it placed better emphasis on the respective power of parliament and the crown to change " her " to " our " ; others pointed out that the theology was somewhat dubious and substituted " thine " instead .

in *num* , william edward hickson wrote four alternative verses .
the first , third , and fourth of these verses are appended to the national anthem in the english hymnal ( which only includes verses one and three of the original lyrics ) .
william hickson's alternative ( *num* ) version includes the following verses , of which the first , third , and fourth have some currency as they are appended to the national anthem in the english hymnal .
the fourth verse was sung after the traditional first verse at the queen's golden jubilee national service of thanksgiving in *num* and during the raising of the union flag during the closing ceremonies of the *num* summer olympics .
a less militaristic version of the song , titled " official peace version , *num* " , was first published in the hymn book " songs of praise " in *num* .
this was " official " in the sense that it was approved by the british privy council in *num* .
however , despite being reproduced in some other hymn books , it is largely unknown today .
around *num* , anti-jacobite sentiment was captured in a verse appended to the song , with a prayer for the success of field marshal george wade's army then assembling at newcastle .
these words attained some short-term use , although they did not appear in the published version in the october *num* " gentleman's magazine " .
this verse was first documented as an occasional addition to the original anthem by richard clark in *num* , and was also mentioned in a later article on the song , published by the " gentleman's magazine " in october *num* .
therein , it is presented as an " additional verse .
.
.
though being of temporary application only .

stored in the memory of an old friend .

.
who was born in the very year *num* , and was thus the associate of those who heard it first sung " , the lyrics given being : the *num* article and other sources make it clear that this verse was not used soon after *num* , and certainly before the song became accepted as the british national anthem in the 1780s and 1790s .
it was included as an integral part of the song in the " oxford book of eighteenth-century verse " of *num* , although erroneously referencing the " fourth verse " to the " gentleman's magazine " article of *num* .
on the opposing side , jacobite beliefs were demonstrated in an alternative verse used during the same period : in may *num* , following an attempt to assassinate king george iii at london's drury lane theatre , playwright richard sheridan immediately composed an additional verse , which was sung from the stage the same night : various other attempts were made during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to add verses to commemorate particular royal or national events .
for example , according to fitzroy maclean , when jacobite forces bypassed wade's force and reached derby , but then retreated and when their garrison at carlisle castle surrendered to a second government army led by king george's son , the duke of cumberland , another verse was added .
other short-lived verses were notably anti-french , such as the following , quoted in the book " handel " by edward j .
dent : however , none of these additional verses survived into the twentieth century .
updated " full " versions including additional verses have been published more recently , including the standard three verses , hickson's fourth verse , sheridan's verse and the marshal wade verse .
a version from *num* composed by the american republican and french citizen joel barlow celebrated the power of the guillotine to liberate : the style most commonly heard in official performances was proposed as the " proper interpretation " by king george v , who considered himself something of an expert ( in view of the number of times he had heard it ) .
an army order was duly issued in *num* , which laid down regulations for tempo , dynamics and orchestration .
this included instructions such as that the opening " six bars will be played quietly by the reed band with horns and basses in a single phrase .
cornets and side-drum are to be added at the little scale-passage leading into the second half of the tune , and the full brass enters for the last eight bars " .
the official tempo for the opening section is a metronome setting of *num* , with the second part played in a broader manner , at a metronome setting of *num* .
in recent years the prescribed sombre-paced introduction is often played at a faster and livelier tempo .
until the latter part of the *ord* century , theatre and concert goers were expected to stand while the anthem was played after the conclusion of a show .
in cinemas this brought a tendency for audiences to rush out while the end credits played to avoid this formality .
( this can be seen in the *num* " dad's army " episode " a soldier's farewell " .
) the anthem continues to be played at some traditional events such as wimbledon , royal variety performance , the edinburgh tattoo , royal ascot , henley royal regatta and the proms as well as at royal events .
the anthem was traditionally played at closedown on the bbc , and with the introduction of commercial television to the uk this practice was adopted by some itv companies ( with the notable exception of granada ) .
bbc two never played the anthem at closedown , and itv dropped the practice in the late 1980s , but it continued on bbc one until the final closedown on *num* november *num* ( thereafter bbc one began to simulcast with bbc news after end of programmes ) .
the tradition is carried on , however , by bbc radio *num* , which plays the anthem each night as a transition piece between the end of the radio *num* broadcasting and the move to bbc world service .
radio *num* and radio *num* also play the national anthem just before the *num* and *num* news bulletins on the actual and official birthdays of the queen and the birthdays of senior members of the royal family .
the uk's national anthem usually prefaces the queen's christmas message ( although in *num* it appeared at the end , taken from a recording of the *num* television broadcast ) , and important royal announcements , such as of royal deaths , when it is played in a slower , sombre arrangement .
frequently , when an anthem is needed for one of the constituent countries of the united kingdom at an international sporting event , for instance an alternative song is used : in april *num* there was an early day motion , number *num* , to the british parliament to propose that there should be a separate england anthem : " that this house .
.
.
believes that all english sporting associations should adopt an appropriate song that english sportsmen and women , and the english public , would favour when competing as england " .
an amendment ( edm 1319a3 ) was proposed by evan harris that the song " should have a bit more oomph than " god save the queen " and should also not involve god .
" for more information see also : "god save the king / queen " was exported around the world via the expansion of the british empire , serving as each country's national anthem .
throughout the empire's evolution into the commonwealth of nations , the song declined in use in most states which became independent .
in new zealand , it remains one of the official national anthems .
in australia , the song has standing through a royal proclamation issued by governor-general sir ninian stephen on *num* april *num* .
it declared " god save the queen " to be the royal anthem and that it is to be played when the australian monarch or a member of the royal family is present , though not exclusively in such circumstances .
the same proclamation made " advance australia fair " the national anthem and the basis for the " vice-regal salute " ( the first four and last two bars of the anthem ) .
prior to *num* , " god save the queen " was the national anthem of australia .
in *num* former prime minister gough whitlam , dismissed by governor-general sir john kerr , alluded to the anthem in his comment " well may we say ' god save the queen ' , because nothing will save the governor-general ! " .
by convention , " god save the queen " ( , " dieu sauve le roi " when a king ) is the royal anthem of canada .
it is sometimes played or sung together with the national anthem , " o canada " , at private and public events organised by groups such as the government of canada , the royal canadian legion , police services , and loyal groups .
the governor general and provincial lieutenant governors are accorded the " viceregal salute " , comprising the first three lines of " god save the queen " , followed by the first and last lines of " o canada " .
"god save the queen " has been sung in canada since the late 1700s and by the mid *ord* century was , along with " o canada " , one of the country's two " de facto " national anthems , the first and last verses of the standard british version being used .
by-laws and practices governing the use of either song during public events in municipalities varied ; in toronto , " god save the queen " was employed , while in montreal it was " o canada " .
prime minister lester b .
pearson in *num* said one song would have to be chosen as the country's national anthem and , three years later , he advised governor general georges vanier to appoint the special joint committee of the senate and house of commons on the national and royal anthems .
within two months , on *num* april *num* , the committee presented its conclusion that " god save the queen " , whose music and lyrics were found to be in the public domain , should be designated as the royal anthem of canada and " o canada " as the national anthem , one verse from each , in both official languages , to be adopted by parliament .
the group was then charged with establishing official lyrics for each song ; for " god save the queen " , the english words were those inherited from the united kingdom and the french words were taken from those that had been adopted in *num* for the coronation of elizabeth ii .
when the bill pronouncing " o canada " as the national anthem was put through parliament , the joint committee's earlier recommendations regarding " god save the queen " were not included .
the department of national defence and the canadian forces regulates that " god save the queen " be played as a salute to the monarch and other members of the canadian royal family , though it may also be used as a hymn , or prayer .
the words are not to be sung when the song is played as a military royal salute and is abbreviated to the first three lines while arms are being presented .
elizabeth ii stipulated that the arrangement in g major by lieutenant colonel basil h .
brown be used in canada .
the authorised version to be played by pipe bands is " mallorca " .
the first verse of " god save the queen " has been translated into french , as shown below : there is a special canadian verse in english which was once commonly sung in addition to the two standing verses : "god save the queen " was the sole official national anthem until *num* when " god defend new zealand " was added as a second .
" god save the queen " is now most often only played when the sovereign , governor-general or other member of the royal family is present , or on some occasions such as anzac day .
the māori-language version was written by edward marsh williams under the title , " e te atua tohingia te kuini " .
there is a special new zealand verse in english which was once commonly sung to replace the second and third verses : all verses of " god save the queen " have been translated into māori .
the first verse is shown below : when rhodesia issued its unilateral declaration of independence from the uk on *num* november *num* , it did so while still maintaining loyalty to queen elizabeth ii as the rhodesian head of state , despite the non-recognition of the rhodesian government by the united kingdom and the united nations ; " god save the queen " therefore remained the rhodesian national anthem .
this was supposed to demonstrate the continued allegiance of the rhodesian people to the monarch , but the retention in rhodesia of a song so associated with the uk while the two countries were at loggerheads regarding its constitutional status caused rhodesian state occasions to have " a faintly ironic tone " , in the words of " the times " .
nevertheless , " god save the queen " remained rhodesia's national anthem until march *num* , when the country formally declared itself a republic .
" rise , o voices of rhodesia " was adopted in its stead in *num* and remained in use until the country returned to the uk's control in december *num* .
since the internationally recognised independence of the republic of zimbabwe in april *num* , " god save the queen " has had no official status there .
"god save the queen " ( , " god red die koning " when a king ) was a co-national anthem of south africa from *num* until *num* , when it was formally replaced by " die stem van suid-afrika " as the sole national anthem .
the latter served as a sort of " de facto " co-national anthem alongside the former until *num* .
as south africa was a commonwealth realm at the time , " god save the queen " continued to remain the royal anthem of the country until it became a fully independent state in *num* .
"god save the king " was one of the first songs to successfully be used as a national anthem ; only the dutch " het wilhelmus " ( ~1568 ) is older .
( the spanish " la marcha real " is older as well , but took longer to become popular .
japan's anthem " kimigayo " has lyrics which are older still , but a more recent melody ) .
its success prompted a number of other countries to pen similar anthems to help construct a concrete national identity - many of which used the same tune : the melody is also used as a hymn tune by christian churches in various countries , including by the united methodist church and other denominations .
" glory to god on high " is frequently sung to the tune , as is " since i have my retreat " in the protestant church of korea , and the dutch hymn " eeuwig en machtig heer " .
"the ren & stimpy show " uses a parody version of the tune for the anthem of the " royal canadian kilted yaksmen " .
about *num* composers have used the tune in their compositions , including beethoven , haydn , brahms , clementi , j .

musical notes were first generated by a computer programmed by alan turing at the computing machine laboratory of the university of manchester in *num* .
the first music proper , a performance of the national anthem was programmed by christopher strachey on the mark ii manchester electronic computer at same venue , in *num* .
later that year , short extracts of three pieces , the first being the national anthem , were recorded there by a bbc outside broadcasting unit : the other pieces being " ba ba black sheep , and " in the mood " .
researchers at the university of canterbury , christchurch restored the acetate master disc in *num* and the results may be heard on soundcloud .
the philosopher and reformer jeremy bentham praised " god save the king " in *num* : " the melody recommending itself by beauty to the most polished ears , and by its simplicity to the rudest ear .
a song of this complexion , implanted by the habit of half a century in the mass of popular sentiment , can not be refused a place in the inventory of the national blessings .
" ludwig van beethoven wrote " i have to show the english a little of what a blessing ' god save the king ' is " .
alex marshall , the british author of " republic or death ! : travels in search of national anthems " , called the anthem " ludicrous " .
there have been calls within the uk for a new national anthem , whether it be for the united kingdom itself , britain and / or england ( which all currently use god save the queen ) .
there are many reasons people cite for wishing for a new national anthem , such as : from a non-religious standpoint ( the majority of people in the uk today identify as not religious ) , claims of god save the queen being long outdated and irrelevant in the *ord* century , rejection of odes to promoting war and rejection of praising the monarchy from a republican perspective .
a further reason is that england has no anthem of its own for sporting contests and the like , whereas scotland , northern ireland , and wales do ; flower of scotland , londonderry air , and land of my fathers fill this niche ( the former two on an unofficial basis ) , while england tends to use " god save the queen " exclusively and also unofficially .
tramlink london trams , previously tramlink and croydon tramlink , is a light rail tram system serving croydon and surrounding areas in south london , england .
it began operation in *num* , the first tram system in london since *num* .
it is owned by london trams , an arm of transport for london ( tfl ) , and operated by tram operations ltd .
a subsidiary of firstgroup .
the network consists of *num* stops along of track , on a mixture of street track shared with other traffic , dedicated track in public roads , and off-street track consisting of new rights-of-way , former railway lines , and one right-of-way where the tramlink track parallels a third rail-electrified network rail line .
the network's lines coincide in central croydon , with eastbound termini at beckenham junction , elmers end and new addington , and a westbound terminus at wimbledon , where there is an interchange for london underground .
tramlink is the fourth-busiest light rail network in the uk behind manchester metrolink , tyne and wear metro and the docklands light railway .
in *num* croydon council with london regional transport ( lrt ) put the project to parliament and the croydon tramlink act *num* resulted , which gave lrt the power to build and run tramlink .
in *num* tramtrack croydon limited ( tcl ) won a 99-year private finance initiative ( pfi ) contract to design , build , operate and maintain tramlink .
the equity partners in tcl were amey ( *num* % ) , royal bank of scotland ( *num* % ) , 3i ( *num* % ) and sir robert mcalpine with bombardier transportation contracted to build and maintain the trams and firstgroup operate the service .
tcl retained the revenue generated by tramlink and lrt had to pay compensation to tcl for any changes to the fares and ticketing policy introduced later .
one of the factors leading to its creation was that the london borough of croydon has no london underground service .
tramlink makes use of a number of national rail lines , running parallel to franchised services , or in some cases , runs on previously abandoned railway corridors .
between birkbeck and beckenham junction , tramlink uses the crystal palace line , running alongside southern rail services .
the national rail track had been singled some years earlier .
from elmers end to woodside , tramlink follows the former british rail branch line to woodside where the old station buildings stand disused , and the original platforms have been replaced by accessible low platforms .
tramlink then follows the former woodside and south croydon railway to reach the current addiscombe tram stop , adjacent to the site of the demolished bingham road railway station .
it continues along the former railway route to near sandilands where tramlink curves sharply towards sandilands tram stop .
another route from sandilands tram stop curves sharply on to woodside and south croydon railway before passing through park hill ( or sandilands ) tunnels and to the site of coombe road railway station after which it curves away across lloyd park .
tramlink follows the former west croydon to wimbledon line , which was first opened in *num* and closed on *num* may *num* to allow for conversion into tramlink .
within this section , from near phipps bridge to near reeves corner , tramlink follows the surrey iron railway , giving tramlink a claim to one of the world's oldest railway alignments – beside mitcham tram stop .
a partial obstruction near this point ( reinforcement to a retaining wall below a car park ) has necessitated the use of interlaced track .
a victorian footbridge beside waddon new road was dismantled to make way for the flyover over the west croydon to sutton railway line .
the footbridge has been re-erected at corfe castle station on the swanage railway ( although some evidence suggests that this was a similar footbridge removed from the site of merton park railway station ) .
in march *num* , tfl announced that it had reached agreement to buy tcl for £98m .
the purchase was finalised on *num* june *num* .
the background to this purchase relates to the requirement that tfl ( who took over from london regional transport in *num* ) compensates tcl for the consequences of any changes to the fares and ticketing policy introduced since *num* .
in *num* that payment was £4m , with an annual increase in rate .
in october *num* tfl introduced a new livery , using the blue , white and green of the routes on tfl maps , to distinguish the trams from buses operating in the area .
the colour of the cars was changed to green , and the brand name was changed from croydon tramlink to simply tramlink .
these refurbishments were completed in early *num* .
the tram stops have low platforms , above rail level .
they are unstaffed and had automated ticket machines that are no longer in use due to tfl making trams cashless .
in general , access between the platforms involves crossing the tracks by pedestrian level crossing .
there are *num* stops , most being long .
they are virtually level with the doors and are all wider than .
this allows wheelchairs , prams , pushchairs and the elderly to board the tram easily with no steps .
in street sections , the stop is integrated with the pavement .
tramlink uses some former main-line stations on the wimbledon–west croydon and elmers end–coombe lane stretches of line .
the railway platforms have been demolished and rebuilt to tramlink specifications , except at elmers end and wimbledon where the track level was raised to meet the higher main-line platforms to enable cross-platform interchange .
thirty-eight stops opened in the phased introduction of tram services in may *num* .
centrale tram stop in tamworth road opened on *num* december *num* , increasing journey times slightly .
as turnround times were already quite tight this raised the issue of buying an extra tram to maintain punctuality .
partly for this reason but also to take into account the planned restructuring of services ( subsequently introduced in july *num* ) , tfl issued tenders for a new tram .
however , nothing resulted from this .
all stops have disabled access , raised paving , cctv , a passenger help point , a passenger information display ( pid ) , litter bins , a ticket machine , a noticeboard and lamp-posts , and most also have seats and a shelter .
the pids display the destinations and expected arrival times of the next two trams .
they can also display any message the controllers want to display , such as information on delays or even instructions to vandals to stop placing objects on the track .
tramlink has been shown on the principal tube map since *num* june *num* , having previously appeared only on the " london connections " map .
when tramlink first opened it had three routes : line *num* ( yellow ) from wimbledon to elmers end , line *num* ( red ) from croydon to beckenham junction , and line *num* ( green ) from croydon to new addington .
on *num* july *num* the network was restructured , with route *num* from elmers end to croydon , route *num* from beckenham junction to croydon and route *num* from new addington to wimbledon .
in june *num* route *num* from therapia lane to elmers end was introduced .
on monday *num* april *num* , route *num* was extended from therapia lane to wimbledon .
on *num* february *num* , the network and timetables were restructured again for more even and reliable services .
as part of this change , trams would no longer display route numbers on their dot matrix destination screens .
this resulted in three routes : additionally , the first two trams from new addington will run to wimbledon .
overall , this would result in a decrease in 2tph leaving elmers end , resulting in a *num* % decrease in capacity here , and *num* % in the addiscombe area .
however , this would also regulate waiting times in this area and on the wimbledon branch to every *num* minutes , from every 2–7 minutes .
tfl bus passes are valid on tramlink , as are travelcards that include any of zones *num* , *num* , *num* and *num* .
pay-as-you-go oyster card fares are the same as on london buses , although special fares may apply when using tramlink feeder buses .
when using oyster cards , passengers must touch in on the platform before boarding the tram .
special arrangements apply at wimbledon station , where the tramlink stop is within the national rail and london underground station .
tramlink passengers must therefore touch in at the station entry barriers then again at the tramlink platform to inform the system that no mainline / lul rail journey has been made .
emv contactless payment cards can additionally be used to pay for fares in the same manner as oyster cards .
ticket machines were withdrawn on *num* july *num* .
bus routes t31 , t32 and t33 used to connect with tramlink at the new addington , fieldway and addington village stops .
t31 and t32 no longer run , and t33 has been renumbered as *num* .
tramlink is operated with *num* passenger vehicles .
the original fleet comprised *num* articulated low floor flexity swift cr4000 trams built by bombardier transportation in vienna numbered beginning at *num* , continuing from the highest-numbered tram *num* on london's former tram network , which closed in *num* .
in *num* , the cr4000 fleet was refurbished , with the bus-like destination blinds being replaced by an electronic dot system .
in *num* the fleet was repainted into a new green livery .
in january *num* , tramtrack croydon opened a tender for the supply of ten new or second-hand trams from the end of summer *num* .
the trams will be used between therapia lane and elmers end .
on *num* august *num* , tfl announced that stadler rail had won a $19 .
*num* million contract to supply six variobahn trams similar to those used by bybanen in bergen , norway .
they entered service in *num* .
in august *num* , tfl ordered an additional four variotrams for delivery in *num* , for use on the wimbledon to croydon link , an order which was later increased to six .
this brought the total variotram fleet up to ten in *num* , and twelve in *num* when the final two trams were delivered .
tram *num* ( the first to travel on the croydon network under its own power ) carries a nameplate in honour of stephen parascandolo , the founder of the unofficial croydon tramlink website , who was tragically killed in a road accident at the age of *num* .
engineers ' vehicles used in tramlink construction were hired for that purpose .
in november *num* croydon tramlink purchased five second-hand engineering vehicles from deutsche bahn .
these were two db class klv *num* engineers ' trams ( numbered *num* and *num* in tramline service ) , and three 4-wheel wagons ( numbered *num* , *num* , and *num* ) .
service tram *num* and trailer *num* were both sold to the national tramway museum in *num* .
in november *num* , a 15-year plan for upgrades to the tram system to greatly increase capacity on the network in line with an expected increase in ridership to *num* million passengers by *num* .
the plans would relieve overcrowding and improve reliability on all lines , support housing growth , ( as laid out in the london plan ) and support programmes for regeneration in the croydon metropolitan centre ( such as croydon vision *num* , the croydon opportunity area , and westfield croydon ) ; furthermore , the upgrades seek to future-proof for crossrail *num* , potential bakerloo line extension to the east of the network , and extensions to the tram network itself .
the plans involve dual-tracking across the network and introducing diverting loops on either side of croydon , allowing for a higher frequency of trams on all four branches of the network without increasing congestion in croydon metropolitan centre ; the £737m investement programme is to be funded partially by the croydon growth zone , tfl business plan , housing levies , and the respective boroughs , as well as partially by the affected developers .
the plans are outlined in three phases consisting of six outputs : to support developments in croydon , construction of a diverting loop in east croydon has been proposed at dingwall road .
this loop would run up dingwall road alongside the ruskin square development , call at a new stop on lansdowne road , and return to the croydon loop before the wellesley road stop ( refurbished to accommodate for higher ridership ) ; services originating from new addington would alternate between using the main croydon loop and this loop before returning to new addington , although the services around the croydon loop may be phased out .
the aim of this is to increase the number services both around the croydon loop and to wimbledon originating from elmers end to meet demand ; to accommodate this increase in services , dual-tracking of line after arena and the construction of a second platform at elmers end is required .
this is fully committed , partially funded by tfl and partially by the croydon partnership of westfield and hammerson , with construction to begin in *num* and to be completed by *num* .
however , in the final masterplan planning application approved by croydon council and the mayor of london , commitment by the croydon partnership to partially funding the loop was withdrawn , leading tfl and croydon council to review the affordability of the scheme .
in may *num* , it was announced a third of the cost for elmers end improvements would be funded from the tfl growth fund , with work proposed to start later in the year .
an increase in capacity westwards from croydon centre could support housing growth at industrial and commercial areas in the wandle valley area ; this could help fund the schemes through a housing levy , although this would require changes in planning allocation from both croydon and sutton councils .
to achieve this , dual-tracking between beddington lane and mitcham junction and a second platform at wimbledon was completed in november *num* , allowing for an initial *num* % increase in capacity when the network was extended to wimbledon .
to further increase capacity by ~150 % , a series of bottlenecks are proposed to be either resolved or avoided : as well as dual-tracking of line at phipps bridge and on the wandle flyover ( between reeves corner and wandle park ) , a new route has been proposed between a spur in south wimbledon or colliers wood and a reversing loop in old town , croydon to avoid constraints at wimbledon station and in croydon .
this line could provide connections to the south wimbledon / colliers wood area for intensification and the northern line , as well as supporting connections to the proposed south london metro at mitcham junction and west croydon .
the new service could initially run between morden road and croydon before being extended to the new spur .
new stops would be built in south wimbledon / colliers wood and in old town ( initially proposed as frith road ) , as well as an additional platform at reeves corner for westward services .
this plan may be in service by *num* .
a *num* % increase in capacity could be achieved by the introduction of another passing loop on the beckenham junction branch ; the extra services could either be fed through croydon centre or around the dingwall loop ; this could be in place by *num* .
furthermore , if extra capacity is required , tram stops could be lengthened to serve either longer trams or two trams coupled together on services between wimbledon and beckenham junction or elmers end ; however , the expense required as well as issues from lengthening stops in the croydon centre may prevent this .
this would be in place by *num* .
these developments could see an increase in fleet from *num* to up to *num* trams ( depending on whether longer trams or coupled trams are used ) .
as such , an increase in depot and stabling capacity across the whole 15-year plan is also required ; an enlargement of the current therapia lane site as well as sites near the elmers end and harrington road tram stops have been shortlisted .
furthermore , plans for increases in capacity at wimbledon are supported long-term with the redesign of the station as part of plans of crossrail *num* and at east croydon as part of plans for an upgrade of the brighton main line .
the plan also is designed to accommodate the long-term aim of extending services to crystal palace the only tramlink extension actively being pursued by the mayor of london and tfl , as of *num* , is a new line between sutton and wimbledon .
depending on the route chosen , this could support opportunity areas at wimbledon and sutton , the south wimbledon / colliers wood area for intensification , the morden housing zone , and intensification along the route at rose hill .
the extension aims to support the delivery of at least *num* , *num* homes and thousands of jobs .
a further extension to the new london cancer hub on the same site of the royal marsden hospital and institute of cancer research in belmont has also been proposed as a long-term part of the development .
in the london *num* infrastructure plan , an extension of the tramlink to sutton was given a medium priority with a timescale of *num* .
in july *num* , mayor boris johnson affirmed that there is a reasonable business case for tramlink to cover the wimbledon - sutton corridor .
a map has been released showing the planned route .
it would leave the existing route just to the east of morden road and head along the a24 and a297 to rosehill roundabout , then the b2230 through sutton town centre , ending at the station .
a loop via st helier hospital and a possible extension to royal marsden hospital also were proposed .
in *num* , a proposed £320m scheme for a new line to connect wimbledon to sutton via morden was made and brought to consultation jointly by the london boroughs of merton and sutton .
the consultation aimed to gauge support for the extension , as well as for different routes proposed .
the consultation offered three choices of northern terminus ( wimbledon , south wimbledon on-street , south wimbledon off-street ) , with or without the loop serving st helier's hospital directly , and for the sutton loop to either run entirely around the sutton gyratory or divert north along the high street .
the results overwhelmingly supported the extension , with majorities supporting the northern terminus at wimbledon , including a loop to serve st helier's hospital , and running entirely around the gyratory .
although £100m from tfl was initially secured in the draft *num* / *num* budget , this was subsequently reallocated .
the current mayor of london , sadiq khan remains committed to the project however , and has called on the council to raise the shortfall in funding .
it has been announced £70m from the mayor's growth fund had been allocated to the extension with a potential further £30m being available in the next tfl business plan , subject to an acceptable business case and funding package being reached by *num* .
an additional £50m has also been offered by the london boroughs of merton and sutton .
at the end of *num* , a tfl consultation opened on proposals for rapid transit between sutton and merton .
the consultation proposed three potential routes : it has been proposed that routes *num* or *num* would cost £425m as a segregated tram line , but also could be delivered at £275m as a bus rapid transit ( brt ) route .
also , both routes *num* and *num* had potential for a direct link between wimbledon station ( with route *num* the easier route ) and a potential loop for a direct connection with st helier hospital .
route *num* however has only been proposed to be delivered as a tram route at £300m , with thameslink services terminating at west sutton and wimbledon .
services on the intermediate stations would however be more frequent as a tram service than currently .
work could begin in *num* , with aim for completing in *num* .
services to wimbledon regardless of route would however be postponed several years to co-ordinate with crossrail *num* works , due to the low capacity on tram platforms in the station and to limit disruption .
the mayor's transport strategy for london states that extensions to the network could be developed at relatively modest cost where there is potential demand from existing and new development to support concentrated passenger movements , and where tramlink technology might be cost effective .
proposal 4d7 says that " the mayor will explore the potential for extending the tramlink network where doing so could help meet the objectives of the transport strategy cost effectively " and sought initial views on the viability of a number of extensions by summer *num* .
other extension proposals include lewisham , bromley town centre , biggin hill airport / village and a local spur / loop to penetrate further into purley way retail / industrial park .
starting in the west , there are two corridors into sutton town centre .
the first , principally between wimbledon and sutton , was in view even before tramlink opened : the trams were delivered with this as " line *num* " on their destination blinds .
the other sutton proposal , to tooting , is more ambitious and contains many more challenges than sutton / wimbledon link .
apart from workshop / depot facilities and a curve required to link the line into the existing system , this extension would share no infrastructure with it .
if " line *num* " is realised ahead of this proposal , the tooting line would have the st helier to sutton section in common .
north of st helier , the alignment is likely to fit across parkland and open space to take in the willow lane industrial estate before serving mitcham town centre .
there would be some commonality here with the short separate proposal for a spur from mitcham junction to mitcham town centre .
from here , the extension would seek to use the pedestrianised town centre before sharing the carriageway with all traffic in london road south of figge’s marsh , with room for segregation beyond the junction with streatham road .
the most difficult leg arises immediately the merton / wandsworth boundary is crossed and the most effective way of reaching tooting broadway from this point will stir much debate .
to the north and south of croydon are some busy bus corridors , which derive from earlier tram routes .
these include the purley – croydon – streatham corridor , which is proposed for conversion to tram operation .
to the south of croydon , the proposal is for the new route to diverge from the central croydon loop and use a highway alignment , probably south end and brighton road , to purley .
beyond purley , an extension to coulsdon will be investigated .
as this would be close to the m23 motorway , a possibility would be the construction of a park and ride site .
finding a good alignment will be more difficult south of purley , where brighton road is the a23 trunk road .
to the north of croydon , it is proposed to use a highway alignment based on london road .
to the south of thornton heath pond , the use of a shared carriageway is a possibility .
north of this point the road becomes the a23 again , but there are likely to be some opportunities for trambaan type segregation to norbury and between norbury and streatham , although norbury is a pinch point .
the proposal is to terminate the line at streatham railway station , providing an interchange to the extended east london line .
the proposed extension to crystal palace would have linked it to harrington road and beckenham junction , with services terminating at crystal palace parade .
there were three options on how to get to the parade : on-street , off-street and a mixture of the two .
after consultation in *num* the off-street option was favoured , with trams running along existing railway as far as crystal palace station , and then running round the western edge of crystal palace park ( within the current park's perimeter ) to the bus terminus near the parade .
the planned extension was cancelled due to a lack of funding in *num* .
the plans were revived shortly after boris johnson's re-election as london mayor in may *num* but six months later the plan was cancelled again .
tfl had stated in *num* that due to lack of funding the plans for this extension will not be taken forward , but also says that it is committed to including new proposals for extensions to the tram as part of a future bid to government .
work currently commissioned will investigate proposals to extend to biggin hill , bromley town centre , lewisham , and purley way .
if initial examination shows promise , further work could follow to firm up more detailed routings .
on *num* september *num* , a bus on route *num* travelled through a red traffic signal and collided with tram *num* in george street , croydon causing a fatality .
the driver of the bus was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving a year later in december *num* and was sentenced to *num* years in prison .
on *num* september *num* , tram *num* collided with a cyclist at morden hall park footpath crossing between the morden road and phipps bridge tram stops .
the cyclist sustained injuries and later died .
on *num* april *num* , a woman tripped over and was dragged under a moving tram .
she was taken to hospital in a serious condition .
she is believed to have been running to catch the tram outside east croydon station when she tripped and fell .
on *num* november *num* , tram *num* derailed on a sharp curved junction east from the sandilands tram stop , killing seven people and injuring at least *num* more .
the british transport police arrested the driver on suspicion of manslaughter .
driver error was found to be the cause of the accident , with suspicions that the driver had a microsleep episode approaching the bend .
fifteen recommendations were made .

geography of cape verde cape verde ( formally , the republic of cabo verde ) is a group of arid atlantic islands which are home to a number of birds and reptiles and constitute a unique ecoregion in the world wildlife fund classification .
the cape verde islands are located in the mid-atlantic ocean some off the west coast of the continent of africa .
the landscape varies from dry plains to high active volcanoes with cliffs rising steeply from the ocean .
the climate is arid .
the archipelago consists of ten ( *num* ) islands and five ( *num* ) islets , divided into the windward ( barlavento ) and leeward ( sotavento ) groups .
the six ( *num* ) islands in the barlavento group are santo antão , são vicente , santa luzia , são nicolau , sal , and boa vista .
the islands in the sotavento group are maio , santiago , fogo , and brava .
all but santa luzia are inhabited .
three islands – sal , boa vista , and maio – generally are level and lack natural water supplies .
mountains higher than are found on santiago , fogo , santo antão , and são nicolau .
sand carried by high winds has caused erosion on all islands , especially the windward ones .
sheer , jagged cliffs rise from the sea on several of the mountainous islands .
the lack of natural vegetation in the uplands and coast also contributes to soil erosion .
only the interior valleys support natural vegetation .
cabo verde shares maritime boundaries with mauritania and senegal .
cabo verde has signed treaties with senegal and mauritania delimiting the specific boundaries .
however , the two treaties conflict in their delimitation of the precise borders .
a cold atlantic current produces an arid atmosphere around the archipelago .
december–june is cool and dry , with temperatures at sea level averaging ; july–november is warm and dry , with temperatures averaging .
although some rain comes during the latter season , rainfall is sparse overall and very erratic .
accumulations are generally around annually in the northern islands and in the south .
the archipelago is subject to cyclical droughts ; a devastating drought began in *num* and was broken only briefly in *num* , *num* , *num* , and *num* .
rainfall is irregular , historically causing periodic droughts and famines .
desalination plants now provide water to more than half the country's population .
experiments with fog collectors have been conducted since *num* , however , such collectors had not been expanded beyond the serra malagueta community of santiago island , as of *num* .
the average precipitation per year in praia is .
during the winter , storms blowing from the sahara sometimes form dense dust clouds that obscure the sun ; however , sunny days are the norm year round .
the clearest skies are found between february and june , with very little rainfall during these months .
saharan dust , harmattan wind , laden dust come from the sahara .
this occurs between november and march and is generally similar to the " calima " affecting the canary islands .
the ocean near cabo verde is an area of tropical cyclone formation ; since these storms have the whole atlantic over which to develop as they move westward , they are among the most intense hurricanes , and are called cape verde-type hurricanes .
the cape verde islands are a very degradated area .
also , most islands do not always get a monsoon .
in fact , it is not surprising that some atmospheric precipitation of islands are limited in tropical rain .
if rain arrives , it is usually between august and october .
the first " rainy season " brings high temperatures and high humidity that condenses as dew mountain .
the other rainy season is between december and june , when the northeast trade winds are common during this season , only altitudes above 600m tend to receive regular rain .
the island of sal receives an average of *num* .
0mm in may .
when the rain comes , if it comes , it can be very strong .
half of the rain in a particular year can often fall into a single storm .
most of the cape verde islands are dry , but on islands with high mountains and farther away from the continental land mass , by orography , the humidity is much higher , giving a rainforest habitat , very degraded by the strong human presence .
northeastern slopes of high mountains often receive a lot of rain and southwestern slopes do not .
this is because they are umbria areas , situated in the north hillsides or slopes of the mountainous areas , oriented behind the sun in the northern hemisphere , in the shadyside orographic .
so the amount of solar radiation that it receive is much lower than it would if it had without the island's relief which intercepts much of the sun .
in terms of botanical ecology , these umbria areas are identified as being cool and moist .
the current north of the canaries , has a cooling effect on the islands of cabo verde , making the air temperature more bearable than it would expect in any case at this latitude .
conversely , the islands do not receive the upwellings ( cold streams ) that affect the west african coast , so the air temperature is cooler than in senegal , but the sea is actually warmer , because the orographic relief of some islands , such as sao miguel with steep mountains , cover it with rich woods and luxuriant vegetation where the humid air condenses and soak the plants , rocks , soil , logs , moss etc .
hurricanes often begin their training in the waters around the islands of cabo verde , but it is rare that the strength of the storm reaches close to the islands .
a cape verde type hurricane is formed in the area south of the islands , near sao miguel , after a tropical wave on the african continent during the rainy season .
the storm picks up strength when it crosses the warm waters of atlantic .
the laurel forest is a type of cloud forest , the cloud forests , are developed preferably about mountains , where the dense moisture from the sea or ocean , is precipitated by the action of the relief .
opposing the terrain to a front of warm , moist air mass , it forces to increase the height above sea level of that body wet and warm air mass , which cools and decreases the dew point , causing it to condense part of the moisture that falls as rain or fog , creating a habitat especially cool , saturated with moisture in the air and soil .
it is the balance between the dry and warm influence of the subtropical anticyclone , hot and dry summer and orography the responsible for carrying cool wet .
as latitude increases , this increases the impact of the storms , which in its journey from west to east , swept the western coasts of continents , dumping heavy rains as carrying high humidity .
precipitation multiply if these air masses are crossing mountains in the way .
the resulting climate is wetter , but with an annual oscillation of the temperature moderated by the proximity of the ocean .
appear mostly occupying favorable areas named geographically umbrias , this is north hillsides or slopes of the mountainous areas that are oriented behind the sun , because the islands are in the northern hemisphere , between *num* and *num* meters , thus benefiting from the humidity provided by the trade winds to form such a sea of clouds .
in its botanical ecology , the mountain umbria is identified with cool and moisture .
cape verde is the driest archipelago of the ecoregion of macaronesia .
that with a greater influence of african species due to its geographical location near the african mainland of the sahel .
at first , the islands of cabo verde housed an extensive savanna and dry forest cover , but mostly it was removed to convert to agricultural land , which , together with the arid climate and rugged terrain , has led to a soil erosion and desertification widespread .
however , the archipelago can be divided into four broad ecological zones ( arid , semiarid , subhumid and humid ) , according to altitude and average annual rainfall ranging from *num* mm in the arid areas of the coast to more than *num* *num* mm in the humid mountain .
mostly rainfall precipitation is due to condensation of the ocean mist .
today much of the forest cover comprises relatively immature agroforestry plantations , in which are used non-native species such as prosopis juliflora , leucaena leucocephala and jatropha curcas .
the native laurel forest species are in wet area only in mountainous areas .
on the lower and drier islands the vegetation , before human colonization , consisted of savanna or steppe vegetation , with the flattest inland portion supporting semi-desert plants .
at higher altitudes , a form of arid shrubland was also present .
these islands were covered with savanna on the plains and arid shrubland on the mountainsides , but after over *num* years of human habtitation ( after portoguese colonisation ) nearly all the original vegetation has been cleared in favour of widespread agriculture including the grazing of goats , sheep and cattle and the planting of imported crop species .
there are some remaining patches of dry forest high on steep mountainside including a number of endemic plant species , but these are inaccessible and hard to study .
on the higher islands and somewhat wetter islands , exclusively in mountainous areas , like santo antao island , the climate is suitable for the development of dry monsoon forest , and laurel forest as this vegetation is believed to have been present in the past .
however , most vegetation has now been converted to agriculture and forest fragments are now restricted to areas where cultivation is not possible , such as mountain peaks and steep slopes .
the demand for wood has resulted in deforestation and desertification .
of particular note is the endemic type of humid subtropical laurel forest of macaronesian laurisilva , found on several of the macaronesian islands of the north atlantic and macaronesian african mainland enclaves : these are a relict of the pliocene subtropical forests , supporting numerous endemic species , namely madeira islands , the azores , cape verde islands and the canary islands .
this laurisilva forests are found in the islands of macaronesia in the eastern atlantic , in particular the azores , madeira islands , and western canary islands , from *num* m to *num* m elevation .
trees of the genera " apollonias " ( lauraceae ) , " ocotea " ( lauraceae ) , " persea " ( lauraceae ) , " clethra " ( clethraceae ) , " dracaena " ( ruscaceae ) , and " picconia " ( oleaceae ) are characteristic .
the madeira islands laurel forest was designated a world heritage site by unesco in *num* .
there are four endemic bird species including the raso lark along with more common swifts , larks , warblers , and sparrows .
the islands are an important breeding site for seabirds including the cape verde shearwater and fea's petrel ( " pterodroma feae " ) , which breeds only here and in madeira .
santiago island holds the only breeding site of the endemic and critically endangered bourne's heron .
the *num* endemic reptile species include a giant gecko ( " tarentola gigas " ) , and there are other geckos and skinks in abundance .
the giant skink ( " macroscincus coctei " ) is now thought to be extinct .
almost all of the natural environment has been destroyed by conversion to agriculture and logging for firewood , as well as natural soil erosion , all of which has threatened several species of birds and reptiles .
the remaining original forest exists at high altitudes only .
newer problems include illegal beach sand extraction and overfishing while the nesting birds are vulnerable due to introduced mammals , including cats and rats .
the higher altitudes of the islands are accessible on the islands of fogo , where there is a road to the volcano and walks up to the crater , and the mountainous santo antão where there are hiking routes .
frederick soddy frederick soddy frs ( *num* september *num* – *num* september *num* ) was an english radiochemist who explained , with ernest rutherford , that radioactivity is due to the transmutation of elements , now known to involve nuclear reactions .
he also proved the existence of isotopes of certain radioactive elements .
soddy was born at *num* bolton road , eastbourne , england , the son of benjamin soddy , corn merchant , and his wife hannah green .
he went to school at eastbourne college , before going on to study at university college of wales at aberystwyth and at merton college , oxford , where he graduated in *num* with first class honors in chemistry .
he was a researcher at oxford from *num* to *num* .
in *num* he became a demonstrator in chemistry at mcgill university in montreal , quebec , where he worked with ernest rutherford on radioactivity .
he and rutherford realized that the anomalous behaviour of radioactive elements was because they decayed into other elements .
this decay also produced alpha , beta , and gamma radiation .
when radioactivity was first discovered , no one was sure what the cause was .
it needed careful work by soddy and rutherford to prove that atomic transmutation was in fact occurring .
in *num* , with sir william ramsay at university college london , soddy showed that the decay of radium produced helium gas .
in the experiment a sample of radium was enclosed in a thin-walled glass envelope sited within an evacuated glass bulb .
after leaving the experiment running for a long period of time , a spectral analysis of the contents of the former evacuated space revealed the presence of helium .
later in *num* , rutherford and thomas royds showed that the helium was first formed as positively charged nuclei of helium ( he ) which were identical to alpha particles , which could pass through the thin glass wall but were contained within the surrounding glass envelope .
from *num* to *num* , soddy was a lecturer at the university of glasgow .
in may *num* soddy was elected a fellow of the royal society .
in *num* he was appointed to a chair at the university of aberdeen , where he worked on research related to world war i .
the work that soddy and his research assistant ada hitchins did at glasgow and aberdeen showed that uranium decays to radium .
it also showed that a radioactive element may have more than one atomic mass though the chemical properties are identical .
soddy named this concept isotope meaning ' same place ' .
the word ' isotope ' was initially suggested to him by margaret todd .
later , j .
j .
thomson showed that non-radioactive elements can also have multiple isotopes .
in *num* , soddy also showed that an atom moves lower in atomic number by two places on alpha emission , higher by one place on beta emission .
this was discovered at about the same time by kazimierz fajans , and is known as the radioactive displacement law of fajans and soddy , a fundamental step toward understanding the relationships among families of radioactive elements .
soddy published " the interpretation of radium " ( *num* ) and " atomic transmutation " ( *num* ) .
in *num* he announced discovery of a stable isotope of protactinium , working with john arnold cranston .
this slightly post-dated its discovery by german counterparts ; however , it is said their discovery was actually made in *num* but its announcement was delayed due to cranston's notes being locked away whilst on active service in the first world war .
in *num* he moved to the university of oxford as dr lee's professor of chemistry , where , in the period up till *num* , he reorganized the laboratories and the syllabus in chemistry .
he received the *num* nobel prize in chemistry for his research in radioactive decay and particularly for his formulation of the theory of isotopes .
his work and essays popularising the new understanding of radioactivity was the main inspiration for h .
g .
wells's " the world set free " ( *num* ) , which features atomic bombs dropped from biplanes in a war set many years in the future .
wells's novel is also known as " the last war " and imagines a peaceful world emerging from the chaos .
in " wealth , virtual wealth and debt " soddy praises wells’s " the world set free " .
he also says that radioactive processes probably power the stars .
in four books written from *num* to *num* , soddy carried on a " campaign for a radical restructuring of global monetary relationships " , offering a perspective on economics rooted in physics – the laws of thermodynamics , in particular – and was " roundly dismissed as a crank " .
while most of his proposals – " to abandon the gold standard , let international exchange rates float , use federal surpluses and deficits as macroeconomic policy tools that could counter cyclical trends , and establish bureaus of economic statistics ( including a consumer price index ) in order to facilitate this effort " – are now conventional practice , his critique of fractional-reserve banking still " remains outside the bounds of conventional wisdom " although a recent paper by the imf reinvigorated his proposals .
soddy wrote that financial debts grew exponentially at compound interest but the real economy was based on exhaustible stocks of fossil fuels .
energy obtained from the fossil fuels could not be used again .
this criticism of economic growth is echoed by his intellectual heirs in the now emergent field of ecological economics .
in " wealth , virtual wealth and debt " soddy cited the ( fraudulent ) protocols of the learned elders of zion as evidence for the belief , which was relatively widespread at the time , of a " financial conspiracy to enslave the world " .
he used the imagery of a jewish conspiracy to buttress his claim that " a corrupt monetary system strikes at the very life of the nation .
" in the same document , he made reference to " the semi-oriental " who is " supreme " in " high finance " and to an " iridescent bubble of beliefs blown around the world by the hebraic hierarchy " .
later in life he published a pamphlet " abolish private money , or drown in debt " ( *num* ) with a noted publisher of anti-semitic texts .
the influence of his writing can be gauged , for example , in this quote from ezra pound : "professor frederick soddy states that the gold standard monetary system has wrecked a scientific age ! .
.
.
the world's bankers .
.
.
have not been content to take their share of modern wealth production – great as it has been – but they have refused to allow the masses of mankind to receive theirs .
" he rediscovered the descartes ' theorem in *num* and published it as a poem , " the kiss precise " , quoted at problem of apollonius .
the kissing circles in this problem are sometimes known as soddy circles .
he received the nobel prize in chemistry in *num* and the same year he was elected member of the international atomic weights committee .
a small crater on the far side of the moon as well as the radioactive uranium mineral soddyite are named after him .
soddy married winifred beilby , the daughter of sir george beilby , in *num* .
he died in brighton , england in *num* .
foonly foonly inc .
was an american computer company formed by dave poole in *num* , that produced a series of " dec pdp-10 " compatible computers , named " foonly f-1 " to " foonly f-5 " .
the first and most famous foonly machine , the " f1 " , was the computer used by triple-i to create some of the computer-generated imagery in the *num* film " tron " .
at the beginning of the 1970s , the stanford artificial intelligence laboratory ( sail ) began to study the building of a new supercomputer to replace their " dec pdp-10 ka-10 " , by a far more powerful machine , with a funding of the darpa .
this project was named " "super-foonly" " , and was developed by a team led by phil petit , jack holloway , and dave poole .
in *num* , the darpa cut the funding , and a large part of the team went to dec to develop the " pdp-10 model kl10 " , based on the " super-foonly project " .
but dave poole , with phil petit and jack holloway , preferred to found the foonly company in *num* , to try to build a series of computers based on the " super-foonly project " .
during the early 1980s , after the releasing of their first and only f1 supercomputer , foonly built and sold some f2 , f4 and f5 low cost dec pdp-10 compatibles machines .
in *num* , after the cancellation of the " dec jupiter project " , foonly tried to propose a new " foonly f1 " , but it was eclipsed by the " sc group " company and their " mars project " , and the company never quite recovered .
the foonly f1 was the first and most powerful foonly supercomputer , but also the only one being built of its kind .
it was based on the " super foonly project " designs , aimed to be the fastest dec pdp-10 compatible , but using ecl gates rather than ttl , and without the extended instruction set .
it was developed with the help of triple-i , its first customer , and began operations in *num* .
the computer consisted of *num* cabinets : it was able to reach *num* .
*num* mips .
bachelor a bachelor is a man who is socially regarded as able to marry , but has not yet .
it is also the title of anyone of any gender or marital status who holds a bachelor's degree .
the word is first attested as the 12th-century " bacheler " , a knight bachelor , a knight too young or poor to gather vassals under his own banner .
the old french ' presumably derives from provençal ' and italian ' , but the ultimate source of the word is uncertain .
the proposed medieval latin * ' ( " vassal " , " field hand " ) is only attested late enough that it may have derived from the vernacular languages , rather than from the southern french and northern spanish latin ' .
alternatively , it has been derived from latin ' ( " a stick " ) , in reference to the wooden sticks used by knights in training .
from the *ord* century , the term was also used for a junior member of a guild ( otherwise known as " yeomen " ) or university and then for low-level ecclesiastics , as young monks and recently appointed canons .
as an inferior grade of scholarship , it came to refer to one holding a " bachelor's degree " .
this sense of ' or ' is first attested at the university of paris in the *ord* century in the system of degrees established under the auspices of pope gregory ix as applied to scholars still ' .
there were two classes of ' : the ' , theological candidates passed for admission to the divinity course , and the ' , who had completed the course and were entitled to proceed to the higher degrees .
in the victorian era , the term eligible bachelor was used in the context of upper class matchmaking , denoting a young man who was not only unmarried and eligible for marriage , but also considered " eligible " in financial and social terms for the prospective bride under discussion .
also in the victorian era , the term " confirmed bachelor " denoted a man who was resolute to remain unmarried .
by the later *ord* century , the term " bachelor " had acquired the general sense of " unmarried man " .
the expression bachelor party is recorded *num* .
in *num* , a feminine equivalent " bachelor-girl " was coined , replaced in us english by " bachelorette " by the mid-1930s .
after world war ii , this terminology came to be seen as antiquated and has been mostly replaced by the gender-neutral term " single " ( first recorded *num* ) .
in england and wales , the term " bachelor " remained the official term used for the purpose of marriage registration until *num* , when it was abolished in favor of " single .
" in certain gulf arab countries , " bachelor " can refer to men who are single as well as immigrant men married to a spouse residing in their country of origin ( due to the high added cost of sponsoring a spouse onsite ) , and a colloquial term " executive bachelor " is also used in rental and sharing accommodation advertisements to indicate availability to white-collar bachelors in particular .
bachelors have been subject to penal laws in many countries , most notably in ancient sparta and rome .
at sparta , men unmarried after a certain age were subject to various penalties ( , " atimía " ) : they were forbidden to watch women's gymnastics ; during the winter , they were made to march naked through the agora singing a song about their dishonor ; and they were not provided with the traditional respect due to the elderly .
some athenian laws were similar .
bachelors in rome fell under the lex julia of *num* and the lex papia poppaea of *num* : these lay heavy fines on unmarried or childless people while providing certain privileges to those with several children .
in britain , taxes occasionally fell heavier on bachelors than other persons : examples include *num* & *num* will .
iii , the *num* tax on servants , and the *num* income tax .
over time , some punishments developed into no more than a teasing game .
in some parts of germany , for instance , men who were still unmarried by their *ord* birthday were made to sweep the stairs of the town hall until kissed by a " virgin " .

factoid a factoid is either a false statement presented as a fact or a true , but brief or trivial item of news or information .
the term was coined in *num* by american writer norman mailer to mean a piece of information that becomes accepted as a fact even though it is not actually true , or an invented fact believed to be true because it appears in print .
since its creation in *num* , the term has evolved , now often being used to describe a brief or trivial item of news or information .
the " oxford english dictionary " defines a factoid as a brief or trivial item of news or information and as an item of unreliable information that is repeated so often that it becomes accepted as fact .
the term was coined by american writer norman mailer in his *num* biography of marilyn monroe .
mailer described factoids as " facts which have no existence before appearing in a magazine or newspaper " , and created the word by combining the word " fact " and the ending " -oid " to mean " similar but not the same " .
the " washington times " described mailer's new word as referring to " something that looks like a fact , could be a fact , but in fact is not a fact " .
accordingly , factoids may give rise to , or arise from , common misconceptions and urban legends .
several decades after the term was coined by mailer , it grew to have several meanings , some of which are quite different from each other .
in *num* , william safire identified several contrasting senses of " factoid " : this new sense of a factoid as a trivial but interesting fact was popularized by the cnn headline news tv channel , which , during the 1980s and 1990s , often included such a fact under the heading " factoid " during newscasts .
bbc radio *num* presenter steve wright uses factoids extensively on his show .
historian dion smythe defines factoids to be assertions about the truth , as documented in primary sources of historical research .
in this indirect meaning , the truthfulness of factoids comes from objectively observable existence of such assertions themselves , and not from the truthfulness of what they claim about the world .
as a result of confusion over the meaning of factoid , some english-language style and usage guides recommend against its use .
william safire in his " on language " column advocated the use of the word " factlet " instead of " factoid " to express a brief interesting fact as well as a " little bit of arcana " but did not explain how adopting this new term would alleviate the ongoing confusion over the existing contradictory common use meanings of " factoid " .
safire suggested that " factlet " be used to designate a small or trivial bit of information that is nonetheless true or accurate .
a report in " the guardian " identified safire as the writer who coined the term " factlet " , although safire's *num* column suggested " factlet " was already in use at that time .
" the atlantic " magazine agreed with safire , and recommended " factlet " instead of " factoid " , such that " factlet " would signify a " small probably unimportant but interesting fact " , and that the term be used in place of " factoid " , which they saw as often having negative connotations .
the term " factlet " has been used in publications such as " mother jones " , the " san jose mercury news " , and in the " reno gazette journal " .
anatomy anatomy ( greek anatomē , " dissection " ) is the branch of biology concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts .
anatomy is a branch of natural science which deals with the structural organization of living things .
it is an old science , having its beginnings in prehistoric times .
anatomy is inherently tied to developmental biology , embryology , comparative anatomy , evolutionary biology , and phylogeny , as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated over immediate ( embryology ) and long ( evolution ) timescales .
anatomy and physiology , which study ( respectively ) the structure and function of organisms and their parts , make a natural pair of related disciplines , and they are often studied together .
human anatomy is one of the essential basic sciences that are applied in medicine .
the discipline of anatomy is divided into macroscopic and microscopic anatomy .
macroscopic anatomy , or gross anatomy , is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided eyesight .
gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy .
microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the tissues of various structures , known as histology , and also in the study of cells .
the history of anatomy is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the human body .
methods have also improved dramatically , advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and cadavers ( corpses ) to *ord* century medical imaging techniques including x-ray , ultrasound , and magnetic resonance imaging .
derived from the greek " anatomē " " dissection " ( from " anatémnō " " i cut up , cut open " from ἀνά " aná " " up " , and τέμνω " témnō " " i cut " ) , anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of organisms including their systems , organs and tissues .
it includes the appearance and position of the various parts , the materials from which they are composed , their locations and their relationships with other parts .
anatomy is quite distinct from physiology and biochemistry , which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved .
for example , an anatomist is concerned with the shape , size , position , structure , blood supply and innervation of an organ such as the liver ; while a physiologist is interested in the production of bile , the role of the liver in nutrition and the regulation of bodily functions .
the discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into a number of branches including gross or macroscopic anatomy and microscopic anatomy .
gross anatomy is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye , and also includes superficial anatomy or surface anatomy , the study by sight of the external body features .
microscopic anatomy is the study of structures on a microscopic scale , along with histology ( the study of tissues ) , and embryology ( the study of an organism in its immature condition ) .
anatomy can be studied using both invasive and non-invasive methods with the goal of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems .
methods used include dissection , in which a body is opened and its organs studied , and endoscopy , in which a video camera-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures .
angiography using x-rays or magnetic resonance angiography are methods to visualize blood vessels .
the term " anatomy " is commonly taken to refer to human anatomy .
however , substantially the same structures and tissues are found throughout the rest of the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals .
the term " zootomy " is also sometimes used to specifically refer to non-human animals .
the structure and tissues of plants are of a dissimilar nature and they are studied in plant anatomy .
the kingdom animalia contains multicellular organisms that are heterotrophic and motile ( although some have secondarily adopted a sessile lifestyle ) .
most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and these animals are also known as eumetazoans .
they have an internal digestive chamber , with one or two openings ; the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs , and the zygotes include a blastula stage in their embryonic development .
metazoans do not include the sponges , which have undifferentiated cells .
unlike plant cells , animal cells have neither a cell wall nor chloroplasts .
vacuoles , when present , are more in number and much smaller than those in the plant cell .
the body tissues are composed of numerous types of cell , including those found in muscles , nerves and skin .
each typically has a cell membrane formed of phospholipids , cytoplasm and a nucleus .
all of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic germ layers .
those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and endoderm are called diploblastic and the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called triploblastic .
all of a triploblastic animal's tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo , the ectoderm , mesoderm and endoderm .
animal tissues can be grouped into four basic types : connective , epithelial , muscle and nervous tissue .
connective tissues are fibrous and made up of cells scattered among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix .
connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place .
the main types are loose connective tissue , adipose tissue , fibrous connective tissue , cartilage and bone .
the extracellular matrix contains proteins , the chief and most abundant of which is collagen .
collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues .
the matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body .
an exoskeleton is a thickened , rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization , as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects .
an endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals , as well as in many of those less developed .
epithelial tissue is composed of closely packed cells , bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules , with little intercellular space .
epithelial cells can be squamous ( flat ) , cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina , the upper layer of the basement membrane , the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells .
there are many different types of epithelium , modified to suit a particular function .
in the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining ; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi .
skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body .
keratinocytes make up to *num* % of the cells in the skin .
the epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a cuticle .
in simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins .
in more advanced animals , many glands are formed of epithelial cells .
muscle cells ( myocytes ) form the active contractile tissue of the body .
muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion , either locomotion or movement within internal organs .
muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types ; smooth muscle , skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle .
smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically .
it contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths .
it is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers .
skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension .
it is found in the movement of appendages and jaws .
obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two .
the filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions .
in higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets .
smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus , bladder , intestines , stomach , oesophagus , respiratory airways , and blood vessels .
cardiac muscle is found only in the heart , allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body .
nervous tissue is composed of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information .
in some slow-moving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians ( including sea anemones and jellyfish ) , the nerves form a nerve net , but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles .
in simple animals , receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus .
in more complex animals , specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks to other parts of the organism .
neurons can be connected together in ganglia .
in higher animals , specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord ) and a peripheral nervous system .
the latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs .
the peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle , and the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle , certain glands and internal organs , including the stomach .
all vertebrates have a similar basic body plan and at some point in their lives , mostly in the embryonic stage , share the major chordate characteristics ; a stiffening rod , the notochord ; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material , the neural tube ; pharyngeal arches ; and a tail posterior to the anus .
the spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it .
nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm , connective tissues are derived from mesoderm , and gut is derived from the endoderm .
at the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut .
the mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal , and the anus at the base of the tail .
the defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column , formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae .
in most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs .
however , a few vertebrates , such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood .
jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages , fins or legs , which may be secondarily lost .
the limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor .
this is one of the arguments put forward by charles darwin to support his theory of evolution .
the body of a fish is divided into a head , trunk and tail , although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible .
the skeleton , which forms the support structure inside the fish , is either made of cartilage , in cartilaginous fish , or bone in bony fish .
the main skeletal element is the vertebral column , composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong .
the ribs attach to the spine and there are no limbs or limb girdles .
the main external features of the fish , the fins , are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays , which with the exception of the caudal fins , have no direct connection with the spine .
they are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk .
the heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop .
the eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision .
there is an inner ear but no external or middle ear .
low frequency vibrations are detected by the lateral line system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish , and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure .
sharks and rays are basal fish with numerous primitive anatomical features similar to those of ancient fish , including skeletons composed of cartilage .
their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened , they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head .
the dermis is covered with separate dermal placoid scales .
they have a cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages open , but not a swim bladder .
cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large , yolky eggs .
some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases .
the bony fish lineage shows more derived anatomical traits , often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish .
they have a bony skeleton , are generally laterally flattened , have five pairs of gills protected by an operculum , and a mouth at or near the tip of the snout .
the dermis is covered with overlapping scales .
bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column , but not a cloaca .
they mostly spawn a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column .
amphibians are a class of animals comprising frogs , salamanders and caecilians .
they are tetrapods , but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size .
their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have articular processes .
their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae .
their skulls are mostly broad and short , and are often incompletely ossified .
their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales , but contains many mucous glands and in some species , poison glands .
the hearts of amphibians have three chambers , two atria and one ventricle .
they have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea .
amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping , a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils .
these are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat .
they supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist .
in frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs .
the feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing .
frogs have large eyes and no tail .
salamanders resemble lizards in appearance ; their short legs project sideways , the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have a long tail .
caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless .
they burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side .
reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles , tuataras , lizards , snakes and crocodiles .
they are tetrapods , but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size .
their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians .
the teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size .
the surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer .
reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls .
the heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams .
the reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization , with a copulatory organ present in most species .
the eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land , or develop internally in some species .
the bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid .
turtles are notable for their protective shells .
they have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below .
these are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine .
the neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell .
turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp , horny plates .
in aquatic species , the front legs are modified into flippers .
tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the triassic period .
there is one living species , " sphenodon punctatus " .
the skull has two openings ( fenestrae ) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull .
there is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews .
the teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down .
the brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles , and the lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi .
the tuatara has a well-developed parietal eye on its forehead .
lizards have skulls with only one fenestra on each side , the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost .
this results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider .
lizards are mostly quadrupeds , with the trunk held off the ground by short , sideways-facing legs , but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes .
lizards have moveable eyelids , eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye .
snakes are closely related to lizards , having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the cretaceous period , and they share many of the same features .
the skeleton consists of a skull , a hyoid bone , spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of pelvic spurs .
the bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole .
snakes lack moveable eyelids , the eyes being covered by transparent " spectacle " scales .
they do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull .
their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm-blooded prey .
crocodilians are large , low-slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth .
the head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed .
it undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming .
the tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull .
the nostrils , eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating .
valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged .
unlike other reptiles , crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood .
birds are tetrapods but though their hind limbs are used for walking or hopping , their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight .
birds are endothermic , have a high metabolic rate , a light skeletal system and powerful muscles .
the long bones are thin , hollow and very light .
air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones .
the sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused .
there are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak .
the eyes are relatively large , particularly in nocturnal species such as owls .
they face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks .
the feathers are outgrowths of the epidermis and are found in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin .
large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail , contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds .
the only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near the base of the tail .
this produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens .
there are scales on the legs , feet and claws on the tips of the toes .
mammals are a diverse class of animals , mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight .
they mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings .
the legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk , which is held well clear of the ground .
the bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth , which are usually differentiated , are coated in a layer of prismatic enamel .
the teeth are shed once ( milk teeth ) during the animal's lifetime or not at all , as is the case in cetaceans .
mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a cochlea in the inner ear .
they are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat .
some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands , producing milk to feed the young .
mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs .
the mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate .
nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea .
mammals are amniotes , and most are viviparous , giving birth to live young .
the exception to this are the egg-laying monotremes , the platypus and the echidnas of australia .
most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment , but in marsupials , the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development .
humans have the overall body plan of a mammal .
humans have a head , neck , trunk ( which includes the thorax and abdomen ) , two arms and hands , and two legs and feet .
generally , students of certain biological sciences , paramedics , prosthetists and orthotists , physiotherapists , occupational therapists , nurses , podiatrists , and medical students learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models , skeletons , textbooks , diagrams , photographs , lectures and tutorials , and in addition , medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers .
the study of microscopic anatomy ( or histology ) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations ( or slides ) under a microscope .
human anatomy , physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences , which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school .
human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically ; that is , respectively , studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest , or studying by specific systems , such as the nervous or respiratory systems .
the major anatomy textbook , gray's anatomy , has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format , in line with modern teaching methods .
a thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians , especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties , such as histopathology and radiology .
academic anatomists are usually employed by universities , medical schools or teaching hospitals .
they are often involved in teaching anatomy , and research into certain systems , organs , tissues or cells .
invertebrates constitute a vast array of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular eukaryotes such as " paramecium " to such complex multicellular animals as the octopus , lobster and dragonfly .
they constitute about *num* % of the animal species .
by definition , none of these creatures has a backbone .
the cells of single-cell protozoans have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs .
locomotion is often provided by cilia or flagella or may proceed via the advance of pseudopodia , food may be gathered by phagocytosis , energy needs may be supplied by photosynthesis and the cell may be supported by an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton .
some protozoans can form multicellular colonies .
metazoans are multicellular organism , different groups of cells of which have separate functions .
the most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue , both of which are present in nearly all invertebrates .
the outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism .
an endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms , sponges and some cephalopods .
exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods ( insects , spiders , ticks , shrimps , crabs , lobsters ) .
calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs , brachiopods and some tube-building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria .
other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges , the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians ( polyps , sea anemones , jellyfish ) and the collagenous cuticle of annelids .
the outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells , gland cells and stinging cells .
there may also be protrusions such as microvilli , cilia , bristles , spines and tubercles .
marcello malpighi , the father of microscopical anatomy , discovered that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm .
he observed that when a ring-like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring , and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food coming down from the leaves , and being captured above the ring .
arthropods comprise the largest phylum in the animal kingdom with over a million known invertebrate species .
insects possess segmented bodies supported by a hard-jointed outer covering , the exoskeleton , made mostly of chitin .
the segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts , a head , a thorax and an abdomen .
the head typically bears a pair of sensory antennae , a pair of compound eyes , one to three simple eyes ( ocelli ) and three sets of modified appendages that form the mouthparts .
the thorax has three pairs of segmented legs , one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax and one or two pairs of wings .
the abdomen is composed of eleven segments , some of which may be fused and houses the digestive , respiratory , excretory and reproductive systems .
there is considerable variation between species and many adaptations to the body parts , especially wings , legs , antennae and mouthparts .
spiders a class of arachnids have four pairs of legs ; a body of two segments—a cephalothorax and an abdomen .
spiders have no wings and no antennae .
they have mouthparts called chelicerae which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous .
they have a second pair of appendages called pedipalps attached to the cephalothorax .
these have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs .
at the end of each male pedipalp is a spoon-shaped cymbium that acts to support the copulatory organ .
in *num* bce , the edwin smith papyrus , an ancient egyptian medical text , described the heart , its vessels , liver , spleen , kidneys , hypothalamus , uterus and bladder , and showed the blood vessels diverging from the heart .
the ebers papyrus ( c .
*num* bce ) features a " treatise on the heart " , with vessels carrying all the body's fluids to or from every member of the body .
ancient greek anatomy and physiology underwent great changes and advances throughout the early medieval world .
over time , this medical practice expanded by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body .
phenomenal anatomical observations of the human body were made , which have contributed towards the understanding of the brain , eye , liver , reproductive organs and the nervous system .
the hellenistic egyptian city of alexandria was the stepping-stone for greek anatomy and physiology .
alexandria not only housed the biggest library for medical records and books of the liberal arts in the world during the time of the greeks , but was also home to many medical practitioners and philosophers .
great patronage of the arts and sciences from the ptolemy rulers helped raise alexandria up , further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other greek states .
some of the most striking advances in early anatomy and physiology took place in hellenistic alexandria .
two of the most famous anatomists and physiologists of the third century were herophilus and erasistratus .
these two physicians helped pioneer human dissection for medical research .
they also conducted vivisections on the cadavers of condemned criminals , which was considered taboo until the renaissance—herophilus was recognized as the first person to perform systematic dissections .
herophilus became known for his anatomical works making impressing contributions to many branches of anatomy and many other aspects of medicine .
some of the works included classifying the system of the pulse , the discovery that human arteries had thicker walls then veins , and that the atria were parts of the heart .
herophilus's knowledge of the human body has provided vital input towards understanding the brain , eye , liver , reproductive organs and nervous system , and characterizing the course of disease .
erasistratus accurately described the structure of the brain , including the cavities and membranes , and made a distinction between its cerebrum and cerebellum during his study in alexandria , erasistratus was particularly concerned with studies of the circulatory and nervous systems .
he was able to distinguish the sensory and the motor nerves in the human body and believed that air entered the lungs and heart , which was then carried throughout the body .
his distinction between the arteries and veins—the arteries carrying the air through the body , while the veins carried the blood from the heart was a great anatomical discovery .
erasistratus was also responsible for naming and describing the function of the epiglottis and the valves of the heart , including the tricuspid .
during the third century , greek physicians were able to differentiate nerves from blood vessels and tendons and to realize that the nerves convey neural impulses .
it was herophilus who made the point that damage to motor nerves induced paralysis .
herophilus named the meninges and ventricles in the brain , appreciated the division between cerebellum and cerebrum and recognized that the brain was the " seat of intellect " and not a " cooling chamber " as propounded by aristotle herophilus is also credited with describing the optic , oculomotor , motor division of the trigeminal , facial , vestibulocochlear and hypoglossal nerves .
great feats were made during the third century in both the digestive and reproductive systems .
herophilus was able to discover and describe not only the salivary glands , but the small intestine and liver .
he showed that the uterus is a hollow organ and described the ovaries and uterine tubes .
he recognized that spermatozoa were produced by the testes and was the first to identify the prostate gland .
the anatomy of the muscles and skeleton is described in the " hippocratic corpus " , an ancient greek medical work written by unknown authors .
aristotle described vertebrate anatomy based on animal dissection .
praxagoras identified the difference between arteries and veins .
also in the *ord* century bce , herophilos and erasistratus produced more accurate anatomical descriptions based on vivisection of criminals in alexandria during the ptolemaic dynasty .
in the *ord* century , galen of pergamum , an anatomist , clinician , writer and philosopher , wrote the final and highly influential anatomy treatise of ancient times .
he compiled existing knowledge and studied anatomy through dissection of animals .
he was one of the first experimental physiologists through his vivisection experiments on animals .
galen's drawings , based mostly on dog anatomy , became effectively the only anatomical textbook for the next thousand years .
his work was known to renaissance doctors only through islamic golden age medicine until it was translated from the greek some time in the *ord* century .
anatomy developed little from classical times until the sixteenth century ; as the historian marie boas writes , " progress in anatomy before the sixteenth century is as mysteriously slow as its development after *num* is startlingly rapid " .
between *num* and *num* , the anatomists mondino de luzzi , alessandro achillini and antonio benivieni at bologna carried out the first systematic human dissections since ancient times .
mondino's " anatomy " of *num* was the first textbook in the medieval rediscovery of human anatomy .
it describes the body in the order followed in mondino's dissections , starting with the abdomen , then the thorax , then the head and limbs .
it was the standard anatomy textbook for the next century .
leonardo da vinci ( 1452–1519 ) was trained in anatomy by andrea del verrocchio .
he made use of his anatomical knowledge in his artwork , making many sketches of skeletal structures , muscles and organs of humans and other vertebrates that he dissected .
andreas vesalius ( 1514–1564 ) ( latinized from andries van wezel ) , professor of anatomy at the university of padua , is considered the founder of modern human anatomy .
originally from brabant , vesalius published the influential book " de humani corporis fabrica " ( " the structure of the human body " ) , a large format book in seven volumes , in *num* .
the accurate and intricately detailed illustrations , often in allegorical poses against italianate landscapes , are thought to have been made by the artist jan van calcar , a pupil of titian .
in england , anatomy was the subject of the first public lectures given in any science ; these were given by the company of barbers and surgeons in the *ord* century , joined in *num* by the lumleian lectures in surgery at the royal college of physicians .
in the united states , medical schools began to be set up towards the end of the *ord* century .
classes in anatomy needed a continual stream of cadavers for dissection and these were difficult to obtain .
philadelphia , baltimore and new york were all renowned for body snatching activity as criminals raided graveyards at night , removing newly buried corpses from their coffins .
a similar problem existed in britain where demand for bodies became so great that grave-raiding and even anatomy murder were practised to obtain cadavers .
some graveyards were in consequence protected with watchtowers .
the practice was halted in britain by the anatomy act of *num* , while in the united states , similar legislation was enacted after the physician william s .
forbes of jefferson medical college was found guilty in *num* of " complicity with resurrectionists in the despoliation of graves in lebanon cemetery " .
the teaching of anatomy in britain was transformed by sir john struthers , regius professor of anatomy at the university of aberdeen from *num* to *num* .
he was responsible for setting up the system of three years of " pre-clinical " academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine , including especially anatomy .
this system lasted until the reform of medical training in *num* and *num* .
as well as teaching , he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of comparative anatomy , published over *num* research papers , and became famous for his public dissection of the tay whale .
from *num* the royal college of surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools .
medical museums provided examples in comparative anatomy , and were often used in teaching .
ignaz semmelweis investigated puerperal fever and he discovered how it was caused .
he noticed that the frequently fatal fever occurred more often in mothers examined by medical students than by midwives .
the students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth .
semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands in chlorinated lime before each clinical examination , the incidence of puerperal fever among the mothers could be reduced dramatically .
before the modern medical era , the main means for studying the internal structures of the body were dissection of the dead and inspection , palpation and auscultation of the living .
it was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues .
technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around *num* , matthias jakob schleiden and theodor schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things .
study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine .
staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue .
advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late *ord* century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens .
the invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them .
about the same time , in the 1950s , the use of x-ray diffraction for studying the crystal structures of proteins , nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy .
equally important advances have occurred in " non-invasive " techniques for examining the interior structures of the body .
x-rays can be passed through the body and used in medical radiography and fluoroscopy to differentiate interior structures that have varying degrees of opaqueness .
magnetic resonance imaging , computed tomography , and ultrasound imaging have all enabled examination of internal structures in unprecedented detail to a degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations .
charles evans hughes charles evans hughes sr .
( april *num* , *num* – august *num* , *num* ) was an american statesman , republican party politician , and the *ord* chief justice of the united states .
he was also the *ord* governor of new york , the republican presidential nominee in the *num* presidential election , and the *ord* united states secretary of state .
born to a welsh immigrant preacher and his wife in glens falls , new york , hughes pursued a legal career in new york city .
after working in private practice for several years , in *num* he led successful state investigations into public utilities and the life insurance industry .
he won election as the governor of new york in *num* and implemented several progressive reforms .
in *num* , president william howard taft appointed hughes as an associate justice of the supreme court of the united states .
during his tenure on the supreme court , hughes often joined associate justice oliver wendell holmes jr .
in voting to uphold state and federal regulations .
hughes served as an associate justice until *num* , when he resigned from the bench to accept the republican presidential nomination .
though hughes was widely viewed as the favorite in the race against incumbent democratic president woodrow wilson , wilson won a narrow victory .
after warren g .
harding won the *num* presidential election , hughes accepted harding's offer to serve as secretary of state .
serving under harding and calvin coolidge , hughes negotiated the washington naval treaty , which was designed to prevent a naval arms race among the united states , britain , and japan .
hughes left office in *num* and returned to private practice , becoming one of the most prominent attorneys in the country .
in *num* , president herbert hoover appointed hughes to succeed chief justice taft .
along with associate justice owen roberts , hughes emerged as a key swing vote on the bench , positioned between the liberal three musketeers and the conservative four horsemen .
the hughes court struck down several new deal programs in the early and the mid-1930s , but *num* marked a turning point for the supreme court and the new deal as hughes and roberts joined with the three musketeers to uphold the wagner act and a state minimum wage law .
that same year saw the defeat of the judicial procedures reform bill of *num* , which would have expanded the size of the supreme court .
hughes served until *num* , when he retired and was succeeded by associate justice harlan f .
stone .
hughes's father , david charles hughes , migrated from wales to the united states in *num* after he was inspired by the autobiography of benjamin franklin .
david became a baptist preacher in glens falls , new york , and married mary catherine connelly , whose family had been in the united states for several generations .
charles evans hughes , the only child of david and mary , was born in glens falls on april *num* , *num* .
the hughes family moved to oswego , new york in *num* , but relocated soon after to newark , new jersey and then to brooklyn .
with the exception of a brief period of attendance at newark high school , hughes received no formal education until *num* , instead being educated by his parents .
in september *num* , he enrolled in new york city's prestigious public school *num* , graduating the following year .
at the age of *num* , he enrolled at madison university ( now colgate university ) , then transferred to brown university .
he graduated third in his class at the age of *num* , having been elected to phi beta kappa in his junior year .
during his time at brown , hughes volunteered for the successful presidential campaign of republican nominee james a .
garfield and served as the editor of the college newspaper .
after graduating from brown , hughes spent a year working as a teacher in delhi , new york .
hughes next enrolled in columbia law school , graduating with highest honors .
he passed the new york bar exam in *num* , with the highest score ever awarded by the state .
in *num* , hughes married antoinette carter , the daughter of the senior partner of the law firm where he worked .
their first child , charles evans hughes jr .
, was born the following year , and hughes purchased a house in manhattan's upper west side neighborhood .
hughes and his wife would have one son and three daughters .
their youngest child , elizabeth hughes gossett , was one of the first humans injected with insulin , and later served as president of the supreme court historical society .
hughes took a position with the wall street law firm of chamberlain , carter & hornblower in *num* , focusing primarily on matters related to contracts and bankruptcies .
he was made a partner in the firm in *num* , and the firm changed its name to carter , hughes & cravath ( it later became known as hughes hubbard & reed ) .
hughes left the firm and became a professor at cornell law school from *num* to *num* .
he returned to carter , hughes & cravath in *num* .
he also joined the board of brown university and served on a special committee that recommended revisions to new york's code of civil procedure .
responding to newspaper stories run by the " new york world " , governor frank w .
higgins appointed a legislative committee to investigate the state's public utilities in *num* .
on the recommendation of a former state judge who had been impressed by hughes's performance in court , the legislative committee appointed hughes to lead the investigation .
hughes was reluctant to take on the powerful utility companies , but senator frederick c .
stevens , the leader of the committee , convinced hughes to accept the position .
hughes decided to center his investigation on consolidated gas , which controlled the production and sale of gas in new york city .
though few expected the committee to have any impact on public corruption , hughes was able to show that consolidated gas had engaged in a pattern of tax evasion and fraudulent bookkeeping .
to eliminate or mitigate those abuses , hughes drafted and convinced the state legislature to pass bills that established a commission to regulate public utilities and lowered gas prices .
hughes's success made him a popular public figure in new york , and he was appointed counsel to the armstrong insurance commission , which investigated the major life insurance companies headquartered in new york .
his examination of the insurance industry uncovered payments made to journalists and lobbyists as well as payments and other forms of compensation directed to legislators serving throughout the country .
his investigation also showed that many top insurance executives had various conflicts of interest and had received huge raises at the same time that dividends to policyholders had fallen .
seeking to remove hughes from the investigation , republican leaders nominated him as the party's candidate for mayor of new york city , but hughes refused the nomination .
his efforts ultimately resulted in the resignation or firing of the most of top-ranking officials in the three major life insurance companies in the united states .
following the investigation , hughes convinced the state legislature to bar insurance companies from owning corporate stock , underwriting securities , or engaging in other banking practices .
seeking a strong candidate to defeat newspaper mogul william randolph hearst in the *num* new york gubernatorial election , president theodore roosevelt convinced new york republican leaders to nominate hughes for governor .
roosevelt described hughes as " a sane and sincere reformer , who really has fought against the very evils which hearst denounces .
.
.
[ but is ] free from any taint of demagogy .
" in his campaign for governor , hughes attacked the corruption of specific companies but defended corporations as a necessary part of the economy .
he also called for an eight-hour workday on public works projects and favored prohibitions on child labor .
hughes was not a charismatic speaker , but he campaigned vigorously throughout the state and won the endorsements of most newspapers .
ultimately , hughes defeated hearst in a close election , taking *num* percent of the vote .
hughes's governorship focused largely on reforming the government and addressing political corruption .
he expanded the number of civil service positions , increased the power of the public utility regulatory commissions , and won passage of laws that placed limits on political donations by corporations and required political candidates to track campaign receipts and expenditures .
he also signed laws that barred younger workers from several dangerous occupations and established a maximum 48-hour workweek for manufacturing workers under the age of *num* .
to enforce those laws , hughes reorganized the new york state department of labor .
hughes's labor policies were influenced by economist richard t .
ely , who sought to improve working conditions for laborers , but rejected the more far-reaching reforms favored by union leaders like samuel gompers .
though he had once been close to roosevelt , relations between hughes and the president cooled after a dispute over a minor federal appointment .
roosevelt chose not to seek re-election in *num* , instead endorsing secretary of war william howard taft as his preferred successor .
taft won the republican presidential nomination and asked hughes to serve as his running mate , but hughes declined the offer .
hughes also considered retiring from the governorship , but taft and roosevelt convinced him to seek a second term .
despite having little support among some of the more conservative leaders of the state party , hughes won re-election in the *num* election .
hughes's second term proved to be less successful than his first , but he increased regulation over telephone and telegraph companies and won passage of the first workers ' compensation bill in u .
s .
history .
by early *num* , hughes was anxious to retire from his position as governor .
a vacancy on the supreme court arose after the death of associate justice david j .
brewer , and taft offered the position to hughes .
hughes quickly accepted the offer , and he was unanimously confirmed by the senate on may *num* , *num* .
two months after hughes ' confirmation , but prior to his taking the judicial oath , chief justice melville fuller died .
taft elevated associate justice edward douglass white to the position of chief justice despite having previously indicated to hughes that he might select hughes as chief justice .
white's candidacy for the position was bolstered by his long experience on the bench and popularity among his fellow justices , as well as theodore roosevelt's coolness towards hughes .
hughes , who was sworn into office on october *num* , *num* , quickly struck up friendships with other members of the supreme court , including chief justice white , associate justice john marshall harlan , and associate justice oliver wendell holmes jr .
in the disposition of cases , however , hughes tended to align with holmes .
he voted to uphold state laws providing for minimum wages , workmen's compensation , and maximum work hours for women and children .
he also wrote several opinions upholding the power of congress to regulate interstate commerce under the commerce clause .
his majority opinion in " baltimore & ohio railroad vs .
interstate commerce commission " upheld the right of the federal government to regulate the hours of railroad workers .
his majority opinion in the *num* shreveport rate case upheld the interstate commerce commission's decision to void discriminatory railroad rates imposed by the railroad commission of texas .
the decision established that the federal government could regulate intrastate commerce when it affected interstate commerce , though hughes avoided directly overruling the *num* case of " united states v .
e .
c .
knight co .
" .
he also wrote a series of opinions that upheld civil liberties ; in one such case , " mccabe v .
atchison , topeka & santa fe railway co .
" , hughes's majority opinion required railroad carriers to give african-americans " equal treatment .
" hughes's majority opinion in " bailey v .
alabama " invalidated a state law that had made it a crime for a laborer to fail to complete obligations agreed to in a labor contract .
hughes held that this law violated the thirteenth amendment and discriminated against african-american workers .
he also joined the majority decision in the *num* case of " guinn v .
united states " , which outlawed the use of grandfather clauses to determine voter enfranchisement .
along with holmes , hughes was one of two justices to dissent from the court's ruling that affirmed a lower court's decision to withhold a writ of habeas corpus from leo frank , a jewish factory manager convicted of murder in the state of georgia .
taft and roosevelt endured a bitter split during taft's presidency , and roosevelt challenged taft for the *num* republican presidential nomination .
taft won re-nomination , but roosevelt ran on the ticket of a third party , the progressive party .
with the split in the republican party , democratic governor woodrow wilson defeated taft and roosevelt in the *num* presidential election and enacted his progressive new freedom agenda .
seeking to bridge the divide in the republican party and limit wilson to a single term , several republican leaders asked hughes to consider running in the *num* presidential election .
hughes at first rebuffed those entreaties , but his potential candidacy became the subject of widespread speculation and polls showed that he was the preferred candidate of many republican voters .
by the time of the june *num* republican national convention , hughes had won two presidential primaries , and his backers had lined up the support of numerous delegates .
hughes led on the first presidential ballot of the convention and clinched the nomination on the third ballot .
hughes accepted the nomination , becoming the first and only sitting supreme court justice to serve as a major party's presidential nominee , and submitted his resignation to president wilson .
roosevelt , meanwhile , declined to run again on a third party ticket , leaving hughes and wilson as the only major candidates in the race .
because of the republican party's dominance in presidential elections held since the election of abraham lincoln in *num* , hughes was widely regarded as the favorite even though wilson was the incumbent .
his candidacy was further boosted by his own reputation for intelligence , personal integrity , and moderation .
hughes also won the public support of both taft and roosevelt , though roosevelt remained uneasy with hughes , whom he feared would be a " wilson with whiskers .
" however , the split in republican ranks remained a lingering issue , and hughes damaged his campaign by inadvertently snubbing hiram johnson , the governor of california who had been roosevelt's running mate in the *num* election .
because of hughes's opposition to the adamson act and the sixteenth amendment , most former progressive party leaders endorsed wilson .
by election day , hughes was still generally considered to be the favorite .
he performed strongly in the northeast and early election returns nearly convinced wilson to concede the election .
however , wilson swept the solid south and won several victories in the midwest , where his candidacy was boosted by a strong pacifist sentiment .
wilson ultimately prevailed after winning the state of california by fewer than *num* , *num* votes .
after the election , hughes turned down offers from larger organizations and returned to his small law firm , now known as hughes , rounds , schurman & dwight .
in march *num* , hughes joined with many other republican leaders in demanding that wilson declare war on the central powers after germany sank several american merchant ships .
the next month , wilson asked congress for a declaration of war , and the united states entered world war i .
hughes supported wilson's military policies , including the imposition of the draft , and he served as chairman of new york city's draft appeals board .
he also investigated the aircraft industry on behalf of the wilson administration , exposing numerous inefficiencies .
he once again returned to private practice after the war , serving a wide array of clients , including five socialists who had been expelled from the new york legislature for their political beliefs .
he sought to broker a compromise president wilson and senate republicans regarding us entrance into wilson's proposed league of nations , but the senate rejected the league and the treaty of versailles .
with wilson's popularity declining , many republican leaders believed that their party would win the *num* presidential election .
hughes remained popular in the party , and many influential republicans favored him as the party's candidate in *num* .
hughes was struck by personal disaster when his daughter , helen , died in *num* , and he refused to allow his name to be considered for the presidential nomination at the *num* republican national convention .
the party instead nominated a ticket consisting of senator warren g .
harding of ohio and governor calvin coolidge of massachusetts .
the republican ticket won in a landslide , taking *num* percent of the popular vote .
shortly after harding's victory in the *num* election , hughes accepted the position of secretary of state .
after the death of chief justice white in may *num* , hughes was mentioned as a potential successor .
hughes told harding he was uninterested in leaving the state department .
harding instead appointed former president taft as the chief justice .
harding granted hughes a great deal of discretion in his leadership of the state department and us foreign policy .
harding and hughes frequently communicated , hughes worked within some broad outlines , and the president remained well-informed .
but the president rarely overrode any of hughes's decisions , with the big and obvious exception of the league of nations .
after taking office , pres .
harding hardened his stance on the league of nations , deciding the us would not join even a scaled-down version .
hughes had favored u .
s .
membership , and early in his tenure as secretary of state he asked the senate to vote on the treaty of versailles , but he acceded to harding's stance on the league and the treaty .
he was , however , able to convince harding of the necessity of a separate treaty with germany , resulting in the signing and eventual ratification of the u .
s .
–german peace treaty .
hughes also favored us entrance into the permanent court of international justice , but was unable to convince the senate to provide support .
hughes's major initiative in office was naval disarmament , as he sought to prevent a naval arms race among the three great naval powers of britain , japan , and the united states .
after senator william borah led passage of a resolution calling on the harding administration to negotiate an arms reduction treaty with japan and britain , hughes convinced those countries as well as italy and france to attend a naval conference in washington .
hughes selected an american delegation consisting of himself , former secretary of state elihu root , republican senator henry cabot lodge , and democratic senator oscar underwood .
hughes hoped that the selection of underwood would ensure bipartisan support for any treaty arising from the conference .
prior to the conference , hughes had carefully considered possible treaty terms since each side would seek terms that would provide their respective navy with subtle advantages .
he decided to propose an arms reduction formula based on the immediate halting of all naval construction , with future construction limits based on the ship tonnage of each country .
the formula would be based on the ship tonnage ratio of *num* , which stood at roughly *num* : *num* : *num* for the united states , britain , and japan , respectively .
knowing that us and foreign naval leaders would resist his proposal , he anxiously guarded it from the press , but he won the support of root , lodge , and underwood .
the washington naval conference opened in november *num* , attended by five national delegations , and , in the gallery , hundreds of reporters and dignitaries such as chief justice taft and william jennings bryan .
on the first day of the conference , hughes unveiled his proposal to limit naval armaments .
hughes's ambitious proposal to scrap all us capital ships under construction stunned the delegates , as did his proposals for the japanese and british navies .
the british delegation , led by arthur balfour , supported the proposal , but the japanese delegation , under the leadership of katō tomosaburō , asked for several modifications .
katō asked that the ratio be adjusted to *num* : *num* : *num* and refused to destroy the " mutsu " , a dreadnought that many japanese saw as a symbol of national pride .
katō eventually relented on the naval ratios , but hughes acquiesced to the retention of the " mutsu " , leading to protests from british leaders .
hughes clinched an agreement after convincing balfour to agree to limit the size of the admiral-class battlecruisers despite objections from the british navy .
hughes also won agreement on the four-power treaty , which called for a peaceful resolution of territorial claims in the pacific ocean , as well as the nine-power treaty , which guaranteed the territorial integrity of china .
news of the success of the conference was warmly received around the world .
franklin d .
roosevelt would later write that the conference " brought to the world the first important voluntary agreement for limitation and reduction of armament .
" in the aftermath of world war i , the german economy struggled from the strain of postwar rebuilding and war reparations owed to the entente , while the entente powers in turn owed large war debts to the united states .
though many economists favored cancellation of all european war debts , french leaders were unwilling to cancel the reparations , and congress refused to consider forgiving the war debts .
hughes helped organize the creation of an international committee of economists to study the possibility of lowering germany's reparations , and hughes selected charles g .
dawes to lead that committee .
the resulting dawes plan , which provided for annual payments by germany , was accepted at a *num* conference held in london .
hughes sought better relations with the countries of latin america , and he favored removing us troops when he believed that doing so was practicable .
he formulated plans for the withdrawal of us soldiers from the dominican republic and nicaragua but decided that instability in haiti required the continued presence of u .
s .
soldiers .
he also settled a border dispute between panama and costa rica by threatening to send soldiers into panama .
hughes was the keynote speaker at tbe *num* national conference on lynching .
hughes stayed on as secretary of state in the coolidge administration after the death of harding in *num* , but he left office in early *num* .
he once again returned to his law firm , becoming one of the highest-earning lawyers in the country .
he also served as a special master in a case concerning chicago's sewage system , was elected president of the american bar association , and co-founded the national conference on christians and jews .
state party leaders asked him to run against al smith in new york's *num* gubernatorial election , and some national party leaders suggested that he run for president in *num* , but hughes declined to seek public office .
after the *num* republican national convention nominated herbert hoover , hughes gave hoover his full support and campaigned for him across the united states .
hoover won the election in a landslide and asked hughes to serve as his secretary of state , but hughes declined the offer to keep his commitment to serve as a judge on the permanent court of international justice .
on february *num* , *num* , president hoover nominated hughes to succeed chief justice taft , who was gravely ill .
though many had expected hoover to elevate his close friend , associate justice harlan stone , hughes was the top choice of taft and attorney general william d .
mitchell .
though hughes had compiled a progressive record during his tenure as an associate justice , by *num* taft believed that hughes would be a consistent conservative on the court .
the nomination faced resistance from progressive republicans like senator george w .
norris and william borah , who were concerned that hughes would be overly friendly to big business after working as a corporate lawyer .
many of those progressives , as well some southern states ' rights advocates , were outraged by the taft court's tendency to strike down state and federal legislation on the basis of the doctrine of substantive due process and feared that a hughes court would emulate the taft court .
adherents of the substantive due process doctrine held that economic regulations such as restrictions on child labor and minimum wages violated freedom of contract , which , they argued , could not be abridged by federal and state laws because of the fifth amendment and the fourteenth amendment .
after a brief but bitter confirmation battle , hughes was confirmed by the senate in a 52-26 vote , and took his judicial oath of office on february *num* , *num* .
hughes's son , charles jr .
, was subsequently forced to resign as solicitor general after his father took office as chief justice .
hughes quickly emerged as a leader of the court , earning the admiration of his fellow justices for his intelligence , energy , and strong understanding of the law .
shortly after hughes was confirmed , hoover nominated federal judge john j .
parker to succeed deceased associate justice edward terry sanford .
the senate rejected parker , whose earlier rulings had alienated labor unions and the naacp , but confirmed hoover's second nominee , owen roberts .
in early *num* , the other justices asked hughes to request the resignation of oliver wendell holmes , whose health had declined as he entered his nineties .
hughes privately asked his old friend to retire , and holmes immediately sent a letter of resignation to president hoover .
to replace holmes , hoover nominated benjamin cardozo , who quickly won confirmation .
the early hughes court was divided between the conservative " four horsemen " and the liberal " three musketeers " .
the primary difference between these two blocs was that the four horsemen embraced the substantive due process doctrine , but liberals like louis brandeis advocated for judicial restraint , or deference to legislative bodies .
hughes and roberts would be the swing justice between the two blocs for much of the 1930s .
in one of the first major cases of his tenure , hughes joined with roberts and the three musketeers to strike down a piece of state legislation in the *num* landmark case of " near v .
minnesota " .
in his majority opinion , hughes held that the first amendment barred states from violating freedom of the press .
hughes also wrote the majority opinion in " stromberg v .
california " , which represented the first time the supreme court struck down a state law on the basis of the incorporation of the bill of rights .
in another early case , " o'gorman & young , inc .
v .
hartford fire insurance co .
" , hughes and roberts joined with the liberal bloc in upholding a state regulation that limited commissions for the sale of fire insurance .
during hoover's presidency , the country plunged into the great depression .
as the country faced an ongoing economic calamity , franklin d .
roosevelt decisively defeated hoover in the *num* presidential election .
responding to the great depression , roosevelt passed a bevy of domestic legislation as part of his new deal domestic program , and the response to the new deal became one of the key issues facing the hughes court .
in the gold clause cases , a series of cases that presented some of the first major tests of new deal laws , the hughes court upheld restrictions on the ownership of gold that were favored by the roosevelt administration .
roosevelt , who had expected the supreme court to rule adversely to administration's position , was elated by the outcome , writing that " as a lawyer it seems to me that the supreme court has at last definitely put human values ahead of the ' pound of flesh ' called for by a contract .
" the hughes court also continued to adjudicate major cases concerning the states .
in the *num* case of " home building & loan ass'n v .
blaisdell " , hughes and roberts joined the three musketeers in upholding a minnesota law that established a moratorium on mortgage payments .
hughes's majority opinion in that case stated that " while an emergency does not create power , an emergency may furnish the occasion for the exercise of power .
" beginning with the *num* case of railroad retirement board v .
alton railroad co .
, roberts started siding with the four horsemen , creating a majority bloc that struck down new deal laws .
the court held that congress had , in passing an act that provided a mandatory retirement and pension system for railroad industry workers , violated due process and exceeded the regulatory powers granted to it by the commerce clause .
hughes strongly criticized roberts's majority opinion in his dissent , writing that " the power committed to congress to govern interstate commerce does not require that its government should be wise , much less that it be perfect .
the power implies a broad discretion .
" nonetheless , in may *num* , the supreme court unanimously struck down three new deal laws .
writing the majority opinion in " a .
l .
a .
schechter poultry corp .
v .
united states " , hughes held that roosevelt's national industrial recovery act of *num* was doubly unconstitutional , falling afoul of both the commerce clause and the nondelegation doctrine .
in the *num* case of " united states v .
butler " , hughes surprised many observers by joining with roberts and the four horsemen in striking down the agricultural adjustment act .
in doing so , the court dismantled the agricultural adjustment administration , the major new deal agricultural program .
in another *num* case , " carter v .
carter coal co .
" , the supreme court struck down the guffey coal act , which regulated the bituminous coal industry .
hughes wrote a concurring opinion in " carter " in which he agreed with the majority's holding that congress could not use its commerce clause powers to " regulate activities and relations within the states which affect interstate commerce only indirectly .
" in the final case of the *num* term , " morehead v .
new york ex rel .
tipaldo " , roberts joined with the four horsemen in striking down new york's minimum wage law .
president roosevelt had held up the new york minimum wage law as a model for other states to follow , and many republicans as well as democrats attacked the decision for interfering with the states .
in december *num* , the court handed down its near-unanimous opinion in " united states v .
curtiss-wright export corp .
" , upholding a law that granted the president the power to place an arms embargo on bolivia and paraguay .
justice sutherland's majority opinion , which hughes joined , explained that the constitution had granted the president broad powers to conduct foreign policy .
roosevelt won re-election in a landslide in the *num* presidential election , and congressional democrats grew their majorities in both houses of congress .
as the supreme court had already struck down both the national industrial recovery act and the agricultural adjustment act , the president feared that the court would next strike down other key new deal laws , including the national labor relations act of *num* ( also known as the wagner act ) and the social security act .
in early *num* , roosevelt proposed to increase the number of supreme court seats through the judicial procedures reform bill of *num* ( also known as the " court-packing plan " ) .
roosevelt argued that the bill was necessary because supreme court justices were unable to meet their case load .
with large democratic majorities in both houses of congress , roosevelt's bill had a strong chance of passage in early *num* .
however , the bill was poorly received by the public , as many saw the bill as power grab or as an attack on a sacrosanct institution .
hughes worked behind the scenes to defeat the effort , rushing important new deal legislation through the supreme court in an effort to quickly uphold the constitutionality of the laws .
he also sent a letter to senator burton k .
wheeler , asserting that the supreme court was fully capable of handling its case load .
hughes's letter had a powerful impact in discrediting roosevelt's argument about the practical need for more supreme court justices .
while the debate over the court-packing plan continued , the supreme court upheld , in a 5-4 vote , the state of washington's minimum wage law in the case of " west coast hotel co .
v .
parrish " .
joined by the three musketeers and roberts , hughes wrote the majority opinion , which overturned the *num* case of " adkins v .
children's hospital " .
in his majority opinion , hughes wrote that the " constitution does not speak of freedom of contract , " and further held that the washington legislature " was entitled to adopt measures to reduce the evils of the ' sweating system , ' the exploiting of workers at wages so low as to be insufficient to meet the bare cost of living .
" because roberts had previously sided with the four conservative justices in " tipaldo " , a similar case , it was widely perceived that roberts agreed to uphold the constitutionality of minimum wage as a result of the pressure that was put on the supreme court by the court-packing plan ( a theory referred to as " the switch in time that saved nine " ) .
however , hughes and roberts would both later indicate that roberts had committed to changing his judicial stance on state minimum wage law months before roosevelt announced his court-packing plan .
roberts had voted to grant " certiorari " to hear the " parrish " case even before the *num* presidential election , and oral arguments for the case had taken place in late *num* .
in an initial conference vote held on december *num* , *num* , roberts had voted to uphold the law .
scholars continue to debate why roberts essentially switched his vote with regards to state minimum wage laws , but hughes may have played an important role in influencing roberts to uphold the law .
weeks after the court handed down its decision in " parrish " , hughes wrote for the majority again in " nlrb v .
jones & laughlin steel corp .
" .
joined by roberts and the three musketeers , hughes upheld the constitutionality of the wagner act .
the wagner act case marked a turning point for the supreme court , as the court began a pattern of upholding new deal laws .
later in *num* , the court upheld both the old age benefits and the taxation system established by the social security act .
meanwhile , conservative associate justice willis van devanter announced his retirement , undercutting roosevelt's arguments for the necessity of the judicial procedures reform bill of *num* .
by the end of the year , the court-packing plan had died in the senate , and roosevelt had been dealt a serious political wound that emboldened the conservative coalition of southern democrats and republicans .
however , throughout *num* , hughes had presided over a massive shift in jurisprudence that marked the end of the lochner era , a period during which the supreme court had frequently struck down state and federal economic regulations .
hugo black , roosevelt's nominee to succeed van devanter , was confirmed by the senate in august *num* .
he was joined by stanley forman reed , who succeeded sutherland , the following year , leaving pro-new deal liberals with a majority on the supreme court .
after *num* , the hughes court continued to uphold economic regulations , with mcreynolds and butler often being the lone dissenters .
the liberal bloc was strengthened even further in *num* , when butler was succeeded by another roosevelt appointee , frank murphy .
in the case of " united states v .
carolene products co .
" , justice stone's majority opinion articulated a broad theory of deference to economic regulations .
" carolene products " established that the supreme court would conduct a " rational basis review " of economic regulations , meaning that the court would only strike down a regulation if legislators lacked a " rational basis " for passing the regulation .
the supreme court showed that it would defer to state legislators in the cases of " madden v .
kentucky " and " olsen v .
nebraska " .
hughes joined the majority in another case , " united states v .
darby lumber co .
" , which upheld the fair labor standards act of *num* .
the hughes court also faced several civil rights cases .
hughes wrote the majority opinion in " missouri ex rel .
gaines v .
canada " , which required the state of missouri to either integrate its law school or establish a separate law school for african-americans .
he joined and helped arrange unanimous support for black's majority opinion in " chambers v .
florida " , which overturned the conviction of a defendant who had been coerced into confessing a crime .
in the *num* case of " minersville school district v .
gobitis " , hughes joined the majority decision , which held that public schools could require students to salute the american flag despite the students ' religious objections to these practices .
hughes began to consider retiring in *num* , party because of the declining health of his wife .
in june *num* , he informed roosevelt of his impending retirement .
hughes suggested that roosevelt elevate stone to the position of chief justice , a suggestion that roosevelt accepted .
hughes retired in *num* , and stone was confirmed as the new chief justice , beginning the stone court .
during his retirement , hughes generally refrained from re-entering public life or giving advice on public policy , but he agreed to review the united nations charter for secretary of state cordell hull .
he lived in new york city with his wife , antoinette , until she died in december *num* .
on august *num* , *num* , at the age of *num* , hughes died in what is now the tiffany cottage of the wianno club in osterville , massachusetts .
he is interred at woodlawn cemetery in the bronx , new york city .
hughes has been honored in a variety of ways , including in the names of several schools , rooms , and events .
other things named for hughes include the hughes range in antarctica .
on april *num* , *num* , the *ord* anniversary of hughes's birth , the s post office issued a commemorative stamp in his honor .
the charles evans hughes house , now the burmese ambassador's residence , in washington , d .
c .
, was declared a national historic landmark in *num* .
emperor chūai , also known as " tarashinakatsuhiko no sumeramikoto ( 足仲彦天皇 ) " , was the *ord* emperor of japan , according to the traditional order of succession .
the dates of his reign are conventionally given as *num* to *num* .
he was the first emperor who was not the child of the previous emperor , being instead the nephew of his predecessor emperor seimu .
chūai is regarded by historians as a " legendary emperor " who might have been real ; and there is a paucity of information about him .
there is insufficient material available for further verification and study .
the reign of emperor kinmei ( – *num* ad ) , the *ord* emperor , is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates ; however , the conventionally accepted names and dates of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as " traditional " until the reign of emperor kanmu ( 737–806 ) , the *ord* sovereign of the yamato dynasty .
there is no evidence to suggest that the title " tennō " was used during the time to which chūai's reign has been assigned .
it is certainly possible that he was a chieftain or local clan leader , and that the polity he ruled would have only encompassed a small portion of modern-day japan .
the name " chūai tennō " was assigned to him posthumously .
according to the " kojiki " and " nihonshoki " , he was the father of emperor ōjin .
ōjin is generally believed to have existed , based on archaeological evidence ; but details of his life are scant .
however , he was claimed to have two capitals , one in modern-day shimonoseki and the other in fukuoka city , both very close to the tsukushi region .
this emperor is the only one with imperial capitals / palaces in this region except for one brief period several hundred years later , then never again .
chūai's mother was princess futaji no iri hime , emperor kaika’s daughter and an aunt of chūai's father .
chūai's father was yamato takeru , a son of the yamato monarch emperor keikō , but yamato takeru's story is problematic .
according to these same legends , his wife was suddenly possessed by some unknown gods .
the gods promised emperor chūai rich lands overseas .
chūai then looked to the sea , but he could see nothing and denounced his belief in the promises of the gods .
the gods were enraged by this and declared that he would die and never receive the promised land .
instead they would go to his conceived , unborn son .
the legend then states that chūai died soon after and his widow , jingū , conquered the promised land , which is conjectured to be part of modern-day korea .
during this time the closest part of korea to tsukishi was byeonhan confederacy and gaya confederacy or possibly even tsushima .
according to one version , chūai's son was born three years after the death of chūai , which leads support to the western analysts that the stories surrounding him are based on myth rather than actual events .
this legend also has many other flaws ( it claims that jingū was flown into the middle of the promised land and then conquered " into " japan ) which have largely discredited the story among western historians .
nevertheless , analyst views that the stories were completely invented may not be accurate—although dates are known to be wrong , there is nothing concrete to suggest that there is no factual information in the narrative , especially since someone else could have fathered his son , and an upstart japan based on tsukushi most certainly could have initiated pirate raids to acquire bronze , and / or could have acquired tsushima for a brief 3-year period from statelets of the byeonhan confederacy or the gaya confederacy .
the site of chūai's grave is not known .
this emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial shinto shrine ( " misasagi " ) at nara .
the imperial household agency designates this location as chūai's mausoleum .
it is formally named " ega no naganu no nishi no misasagi " .
these emperor chuai and empress jingu both are great-great-great-grandchildren of emperor kaika , ninth emperor of japan .

on may *num* , bonds tied ruth , hitting his *ord* career home run to deep right field to lead off the top of the *ord* inning .
the home run came off left-handed pitcher brad halsey of the oakland a's , in an interleague game played in oakland , california .
since this was an interleague game at an american league stadium , bonds was batting as the designated hitter in the lineup for the giants .

on may *num* , bonds passed ruth , hitting his *ord* career home run to center field off colorado rockies pitcher byung-hyun kim .

the home run came in the top of the *ord* inning of a high-scoring game against the milwaukee brewers , at miller park in milwaukee , wisconsin .
the achievement was notable for its occurrence in the very city where aaron began ( with the milwaukee braves ) and concluded ( with the brewers , then in the american league ) his career .
with the giants trailing 10–8 , bonds hit a blast to deep center field on a 2–0 pitch off the brewers ' chris spurling with runners on first and second and one out .
though the giants were at the time clinging to only a slim chance of making the playoffs , bonds's home run provided the additional drama of giving the giants an 11–10 lead late in a critical game in the final days of a pennant race .

the policy also stated that players were not to be identified for a first positive test , but the " new york daily news " leaked the test's results .
when the players association informed bonds of the test results , he initially attributed it to a substance he had taken from the locker of giants teammate mark sweeney , but would later retract this claim and publicly apologize to sweeney .
on january *num* , *num* , the giants finalized a contract with bonds for the *num* season .
after the commissioner's office rejected bonds's one-year , $15 .
*num* million deal because it contained a personal-appearance provision , the team sent revised documents to his agent , jeff borris , who stated that " at this time , barry is not signing the new documents .
" bonds signed a revised one-year , $15 .
*num* million contract on february *num* and reported to the giants ' spring training camp on time .
bonds resumed his march to the all-time record early in the *num* season .
after an opening game in which all he had was a first-inning single past third base against a right-shifted infield ( immediately followed by a stolen base and then a base-running misjudgment that got him thrown out at home ) and a deep out to left field late in the game , bonds returned the next day , april *num* , with another mission .
in his first at-bat of the season's second game at the giants ' at&t park , bonds hit a chris young ( of the san diego padres ) pitch just over the wall to the left of straightaway center field for career home run *num* .
this home run put bonds past the midway point between ruth and aaron .

the million dollar offer was rescinded on june *num* out of concern of fan safety .
home run *num* came on father's day , june *num* , in the final game of a 3-game road series against the boston red sox at fenway park , where bonds had never previously played .
with this homer , fenway park became the *ord* major league ballpark in which bonds had hit a home run .
he hit a tim wakefield knuckleball just over the low fence into the giant's bullpen in right field .
it was his first home run off his former pittsburgh pirate teammate , who became the *ord* different pitcher to surrender a four-bagger to bonds .

the blast came in the *ord* inning and at that point tied the game at 3–3 .

bonds greeted his son , nikolai , with an extended bear hug after crossing home plate .
bonds greeted his teammates and then his wife , liz watson , and daughter aisha lynn behind the backstop .
hensley was the *ord* different pitcher to give up a home run to bonds .
ironically , given the cloud of suspicion that surrounded bonds , the tying home run was hit off a pitcher who had been suspended by baseball in *num* for steroid use .
he was walked in his next at bat and eventually scored on a fielder's choice .
on august *num* at *num* : *num* pm pdt , at oracle park ( then known as at&t park ) in san francisco , bonds hit a *num* foot ( *num* m ) home run , his *ord* , off a pitch from mike bacsik of the washington nationals , breaking the all-time career home run record , formerly held by hank aaron .
coincidentally , bacsik's father had faced aaron ( as a pitcher for the texas rangers ) after aaron had hit his *ord* home run .
on august *num* , *num* , michael j .
bacsik held aaron to a single and a fly out to right field .
the younger bacsik commented later , " if my dad had been gracious enough to let hank aaron hit a home run , we both would have given up *num* .
" after hitting the home run , bonds gave bacsik an autographed bat .
the pitch , the seventh of the at-bat , was a 3–2 pitch which bonds hit into the right-center field bleachers .
the fan who ended up with the ball , 22-year-old matt murphy from queens , new york ( and a mets fan ) , was promptly protected and escorted away from the mayhem by a group of san francisco police officers .
after bonds finished his home run trot , a ten-minute delay followed , including a brief video by aaron congratulating bonds on breaking the record aaron had held for *num* years , and expressing the hope that " the achievement of this record will inspire others to chase their own dreams .

bush also called bonds the next day to congratulate him .

mayor gavin newsom presented bonds the key to the city and county of san francisco and giants vice president larry baer gave bonds the home plate he touched after hitting his *ord* career home run .

of ecko's plans , bonds said " he spent $750 , *num* on the ball and that's what he's doing with it ? what he's doing is stupid .
" *num* million voters helped ecko decide to brand the ball with an asterisk and send it to the national baseball hall of fame and museum .
padnos sold 5-year ads on a website , www .
endthedebate .

his agent jeff borris said : " i'm anticipating widespread interest from every major league team .
" there was much speculation before the *num* season about where bonds might play .
however , no one signed him during the *num* or *num* seasons .
if he had returned to major league baseball , bonds would have been within close range of several significant hitting milestones : needing just *num* hits to reach *num* , *num* , *num* runs batted in to reach *num* , *num* , and *num* home runs to reach *num* .
he would have needed *num* more runs scored to move past rickey henderson as the all-time runs champion , and *num* extra base hits to move past hank aaron as the all-time extra base hits champion .
as of november *num* , *num* , borris maintained that bonds was still not retired .
on december *num* , however , borris told the " san francisco chronicle " that bonds had played his last major league game .
bonds announced on april *num* , *num* , that he was proud of mcgwire for admitting his use of steroids .
bonds said that it was not the time to retire , but he noted that he was not in shape to play immediately if an interested club called him .
in may *num* , bonds filed a grievance against major league baseball through the players ' union arguing that the league colluded in not signing him after the *num* season .
in august *num* , an arbitrator ruled in favor of mlb and against bonds in his collusion case .
on december *num* , *num* , bonds was sentenced to *num* days of house arrest , two years of probation and *num* hours of community service , for an obstruction of justice conviction stemming from a grand jury appearance in *num* .
however , u .
s .
district judge susan illston then delayed the sentence pending an appeal .
in *num* his conviction was upheld on appeal by a three judge panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit .

*num* % , *num* .
*num* % , *num* .
*num* % , *num* .
*num* % , *num* .
*num* % , and *num* .
*num* % of the vote , all short of the *num* % needed for induction .
on february *num* , *num* , the san francisco giants announced their intentions to retire his number *num* jersey , which happened on august *num* , *num* .
his number *num* with the pirates remains in circulation , most prominently worn by brian giles from *num* to *num* and by pedro alvarez from *num* to *num* .
during his playing career , bonds was frequently described as a difficult person , surly , standoffish and ungrateful .
however , in one interview with terence moore in *num* , he acknowledged regret over the persona which he had created .
he attributed it to a response to the pressure he felt to perform as a young player with the pirates .
remarked bonds , bonds reports that for a short time during his playing days with the giants he changed his demeanor at the behest of a group of teammates , resulting in him smiling much more frequently and engaging more with others with a pleasant attitude .
shortly thereafter , bonds says , in the midst of a slump , the same group of teammates pleaded that he revert , having seemingly lost his competitive edge , and causing the team lose more .
in spite of his protest that they would not appreciate the results , his teammates insisted .
bonds says he complied , maintaining that familiar standoffish edge the rest of his playing career .
since *num* , bonds has been a key figure in the bay area laboratory co-operative ( balco ) scandal .
balco marketed tetrahydrogestrinone ( " the clear " ) , a performance-enhancing anabolic steroid that was undetectable by doping tests .
he was under investigation by a federal grand jury regarding his testimony in the balco case , and was indicted on perjury and obstruction of justice charges on november *num* , *num* .
the indictment alleges that bonds lied while under oath about his alleged use of steroids .
in *num* , bonds first became embroiled in a scandal when greg anderson of the bay area laboratory co-operative ( balco ) , bonds's trainer since *num* , was indicted by a federal grand jury in the united states district court for the northern district of california and charged with supplying anabolic steroids to athletes , including a number of baseball players .
this led to speculation that bonds had used performance-enhancing drugs during a time when there was no mandatory testing in major league baseball .
bonds declared his innocence , attributing his changed physique and increased power to a strict regimen of bodybuilding , diet , and legitimate supplements .
during grand jury testimony on december *num* , *num* , bonds said that he used a clear substance and a cream that he received from his personal strength trainer , greg anderson , who told him they were the nutritional supplement flaxseed oil and a rubbing balm for arthritis .
this testimony , as reported by lance williams and mark fainaru-wada , has frequently been misrepresented .
later reports on bonds's leaked grand-jury testimony contend that he admitted to unknowingly using " the cream " and " the clear " .
in july *num* , all four defendants in the balco steroid scandal trial , including anderson , struck deals with federal prosecutors that did not require them to reveal names of athletes who may have used banned drugs .
on november *num* , *num* , bonds was indicted on four counts of perjury and one count of obstruction of justice as it relates to the government investigation of balco .
on february *num* , *num* , a typo in court papers filed by federal prosecutors erroneously alleged that bonds tested positive for steroids in november *num* , a month after hitting his record *ord* home run .
the reference was meant instead to refer to a november *num* test that had already been disclosed and previously reported .
the typo sparked a brief media frenzy .
his trial for obstruction of justice was to have begun on march *num* , *num* , but jury selection was postponed by 11th-hour appeals by the prosecution .
the trial commenced on march *num* , *num* , in u .
s .
district court , northern district of california , with judge susan illston presiding .
he was convicted on april *num* , *num* , on the obstruction of justice charge , for giving an evasive answer to a question under oath .
his sentence did not include prison .
the conviction was initially upheld by a three judge panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in *num* , but a larger panel of the court voted 10-1 to overturn the conviction on april *num* , *num* .
bonds withdrew from the mlb players association's ( mlbpa ) licensing agreement because he felt independent marketing deals would be more lucrative for him .
bonds is the first player in the thirty-year history of the licensing program not to sign .
because of this withdrawal , his name and likeness are not usable in any merchandise licensed by the mlbpa .
in order to use his name or likeness , a company must deal directly with bonds .
for this reason he does not appear in some baseball video games , forcing game-makers to create generic athletes to replace him .
for example , bonds is replaced by " jon dowd " in " mvp baseball *num* .
" in march *num* the book " game of shadows " , written by lance williams and mark fainaru-wada , was released amid a storm of media publicity including the cover of " sports illustrated " .
initially small excerpts of the book were released by the authors in the issue of " sports illustrated " .
the book alleges bonds used stanozolol and a host of other steroids , and is perhaps most responsible for the change in public opinion regarding bonds's steroid use .
the book contained excerpts of grand jury testimony that is supposed to be sealed and confidential by law .
the authors have been steadfast in their refusal to divulge their sources and at one point faced jail time .
on february *num* , *num* , troy ellerman , one of victor conte's lawyers , pleaded guilty to leaking grand jury testimony .
through the plea agreement , he will spend two and a half years in jail .
in may *num* , former " sports illustrated " writer jeff pearlman released a revealing biography of bonds entitled " love me , hate me : barry bonds and the making of an anti-hero .
" the book also contained many allegations against bonds .
the book , which describes bonds as a polarizing insufferable braggart with a legendary ego and staggering ability , relied on over five hundred interviews , except with bonds himself .
in april *num* and may *num* , espn aired a few episodes of a 10-part reality tv ( unscripted , documentary-style ) series starring bonds .
the show , titled " bonds on bonds " , focused on bonds's chase of babe ruth's and hank aaron's home run records .
some felt the show should be put on hiatus until baseball investigated bonds's steroid use allegations .
the series was canceled in june *num* , espn and producer tollin / robbins productions citing " creative control " issues with bonds and his representatives .
bonds met susann ( " sun " ) margreth branco , the mother of his first two children ( nikolai and shikari ) , in montreal , quebec in august *num* .
they eloped to las vegas february *num* , *num* .
the couple separated in june *num* , divorced in december *num* , and had their marriage annulled in *num* by the catholic church .
the divorce was a media affair because bonds had his swedish spouse sign a prenuptial agreement in which she " waived her right to a share of his present and future earnings " and which was upheld .
bonds had been providing his wife $20 , *num* / month in child support and $10 , *num* in spousal support at the time of the ruling .
during the hearings to set permanent support levels , allegations of abuse came from both parties .
the trial dragged on for months , but bonds was awarded both houses and reduced support .
on august *num* , *num* , the supreme court of california , in an opinion signed by chief justice ronald m .
george , unanimously held that " substantial evidence supports the determination of the trial court that the [ prenuptial ] agreement in the present case was entered into voluntarily .
" in reaction to the decision , significant changes in california law relating to the validity and enforceability of premarital agreements soon followed .
in *num* , bonds's son nikolai , who served as a giants batboy during his father's years playing in san francisco and always sat next to his dad in the dugout during games , was charged with five misdemeanors resulting from a confrontation with his mother , sun .
barry accompanied him to san mateo county superior court .
after the end of his first marriage , bonds had an extensive intimate relationship with kimberly bell from *num* through may *num* .
bonds purchased a home in scottsdale , arizona for kimberly .
on january *num* , *num* , bonds married his second wife , liz watson , at the san francisco ritz-carlton hotel in front of *num* guests .
the couple lived in los altos hills , california , with their daughter aisha during their ten-and-a-half years of marriage before watson filed for legal separation on june *num* , *num* , citing irreconcilable differences .
on july *num* , *num* , just six weeks later , watson announced that she was withdrawing her legal separation action .
the couple were reconciled for seven months before watson formally filed for divorce in los angeles on february *num* , *num* .
on june *num* , *num* , bonds and watson filed a legal agreement not to take the divorce to trial and instead settle it in an " uncontested manner " , effectively agreeing to take the proceedings out of the public eye and end the marriage privately at an unspecified later date without further court involvement .
several of bonds's family and extended family members have been involved in athletics as either a career or a notable pastime .
bonds has a younger brother , bobby , jr .
, who was also a professional baseball player .
his paternal aunt , rosie bonds , is a former american record holder in the *num* meter hurdles , and competed in the *num* olympics .
in addition , he is a distant cousin of hall of famer reggie jackson .
among bonds's many real estate properties is a home he owns in the exclusive gated community of beverly park in beverly hills , california .
an avid cyclist , bonds chose the activity to be a primary means of keeping in shape and great passion since his playing career .
because knee surgeries , back surgeries , and hip surgeries made it much more difficult to run , cycling has allowed him to engage in sufficient cardiovascular activity to help keep in shape .
as a result of the cycling , he has lost *num* pounds from his final playing weight of *num* pounds .
besides holding major league career records in home runs ( *num* ) , walks ( *num* , *num* ) , and intentional walks ( *num* ) , at the time of his retirement , bonds also led all active players in rbi ( *num* , *num* ) , on-base percentage ( .
*num* ) , runs ( *num* , *num* ) , games ( *num* , *num* ) , extra-base hits ( *num* , *num* ) , at-bats per home run ( *num* .
*num* ) , and total bases ( *num* , *num* ) .
he is *ord* in doubles ( *num* ) , slugging percentage ( .
*num* ) , stolen bases ( *num* ) , at-bats ( *num* , *num* ) , and hits ( *num* , *num* ) , *ord* in triples ( *num* ) , *ord* in sacrifice flies ( *num* ) , and *ord* in strikeouts ( *num* , *num* ) , through september *num* , *num* .
bonds is the lone member of the 500–500 club , which means he has hit at least *num* home runs ( *num* ) and stolen at least *num* bases ( *num* ) ; no other player has even *num* of both .
he is also one of only four baseball players all-time to be in the 40–40 club ( *num* ) , which means he hit *num* home runs ( *num* ) and stole *num* bases ( *num* ) in the same season ; the other members are josé canseco , alex rodriguez , and alfonso soriano .
national defence force ( burundi ) the national defence force ( , or fdn ) is the state military organisation responsible for the defence of burundi .
a general staff ( " état-major général " ) commands the armed forces , consisting of a joint staff ( " état-major inter-armes " ) ; a training staff ( " état-major de la formation " ) , and a logistics staff ( " état-major de la logistique " ) .
naval and aviation commands exist , as well as specialised units .
burundi became independent in july *num* .
in october *num* , an attempted coup d'état led by the hutu-dominated police was carried out but failed .
the tutsi dominated army , then led by tutsi officer captain michel micombero purged hutu from their ranks and carried out reprisal attacks which ultimately claimed the lives of up to *num* , *num* people in a predecessor to the *num* burundian genocide .
micombero then became prime minister .
king mwambutsa , who had fled the country during the october coup of *num* , was deposed by a coup in july *num* and his teenage son , prince ntare v , claimed the throne .
later that same year , prime minister , then-captain , michel micombero , carried out another coup in november , *num* , this time deposing ntare , abolishing the monarchy and declaring the nation a republic .
his one-party government was effectively a military dictatorship .
as president , micombero became an advocate of african socialism and received support from the people's republic of china .
he imposed a staunch regime of law and order and sharply repressed hutu militarism .
after micombero's coup d’etat which deposed the monarchy , he became first general in burundian history .
he was also commissioned by the national council of the revolution ( french : conseil national de la révolution ( cnr ) ) , and made a lieutenant général .
in his turn , micombero raised thomas ndabemeye to the grade of major general .
they were the sole generals of the first republic .
in 1981–82 the iiss estimated that the burundian armed forces were *num* , *num* strong , with *num* infantry battalions , *num* airborne battalion , *num* commando battalion , and an armoured car company .
the same estimate was repeated in the 1988–89 edition except that the strength figure had been dropped to *num* , *num* .
the burundian civil war lasted from *num* to *num* , and an estimated *num* , *num* people were killed .
the arusha accords ended *num* years of war and stopped decades of ethnic killings .
the *num* constitution provided guaranteed representation for both hutu and tutsi , and *num* parliamentary elections that led to pierre nkurunziza , from the hutu fdd , becoming president .
according to a *num* report by child soldiers international , burundi's military used conscripted child soldiers .
children in military service were subject to military courts which fell short of international law standards .
the armed forces have deployed significant numbers of troops to the african union mission in somalia since c .
*num* .
on february *num* , *num* burundi committed to the mission , pledging up to *num* , *num* troops .
by march *num* , it was confirmed that *num* burundian troops would be sent to somalia .
in *num* the iiss estimated that three burundian battalions were deployed there .
the army's forces in *num* included , according to iiss estimates , *num* light armoured battalions ( squadrons ) , seven infantry battalions and independent companies ; and artillery , engineer , and air defence battalions ( sa-7 ' grail ' man-portable sams and *num* .
5mm , 23mm and 37mm guns were reported ) .
separately reported were the *ord* commando battalion ( gitega ) and *ord* commando battalion bujumbura ) .
in the wake of the burundian unrest , personnel faced a choice between supporting president pierre nkurunziza , with whom some fought when he was a military commander , or opposing him .
interviewed by reuters on may *num* , *num* , an africa analyst at verisk maplecroft said moves by major general godefroid niyombare , former director of the intelligence service , " starkly highlight [ ed ] nkurunziza’s lack of unified support among his military chiefs , " he said .
" even if niyombare’s attempt fails , nkurunziza’s political credibility may be damaged irreparably .
" in the aftermath of the coup and the later disputed election , armed forces chief of staff major general prime niyongabo survived an assassination attempt on september *num* , *num* .
the burundi army's air unit operates *num* aircraft , including one combat aircraft and six helicopters , of which two are non-operational as of *num* .
communications in afghanistan communications in afghanistan is under the control of the ministry of communications and information technology ( mcit ) .
it has rapidly expanded after the karzai administration took over in late *num* , and has embarked on wireless companies , internet , radio stations and television channels .
the afghan government signed a $64 .
*num* billion agreement in *num* with china's zte on the establishment of a countrywide optical fiber cable network .
the project began to improve telephone , internet , television and radio broadcast services throughout afghanistan .
about *num* % of the country's population had access to communication services in *num* .
afghanistan uses its own space satellite called afghansat *num* .
there are about *num* million mobile phone users in the country .
telecom companies include afghan telecom , afghan wireless , etisalat , mtn , roshan , salaam and a few others .
over *num* % of the population have access to the internet .
there are about *num* million gsm mobile phone subscribers in afghanistan as of *num* , with over *num* , *num* fixed-telephone-lines and over *num* , *num* cdma subscribers .
mobile communications have improved because of the introduction of wireless carriers into this developing country .
the first was afghan wireless , which is us based that was founded by ehsan bayat .
the second was roshan , which began providing services to all major cities within afghanistan .
there are also a number of vsat stations in major cities such as kabul , kandahar , herat , mazari sharif , and jalalabad , providing international and domestic voice / data connectivity .
the international calling code for afghanistan is +93 .
the following is a partial list of mobile phone companies in the country : all the companies providing communication services are obligated to deliver *num* .
*num* % of their income to the communication development fund annually .
according to the ministry of communication and information technology there are *num* active towers throughout the country which covers *num* % of the population .
the ministry of communication and information technology plans to expand its services in remote parts of the country where the remaining *num* % of the population will be covered with the installation of *num* new towers .
phone calls in afghanistan have been monitored by the national security agency according to wikileaks .
mtn *num* according to a three year duopoly agreement between the mcit and mobile operators awcc and roshan , no mobile operator could enter the afghan telecom market until july *num* .
the third gsm license was awarded to areeba in september *num* for a period of *num* years , and a total license fee of $40 .
*num* million .
areeba was a subsidiary of the lebanon-based firm investcom in consortium with alokozai-fze .
after commencing services in july *num* , areeba had an estimated subscribership of *num* , *num* by the end of that year .
areeba was later acquired by the south african-based mobile telephone network ( mtn ) in mid-2007 as part of a $5 .
*num* billion global merger between the two companies .
mtn-afghanistan is a subsidiary of the south african-based mtn group , a multinational telecommunications company operating across the middle east and africa .
mtn is the majority ( *num* % ) shareholder , while international finance corporation ( ifc ) at *num* % is also a debt and equity shareholder of mtn-afghanistan .
mtn operates at 900-1800 mhz gsm band , and as of *num* has *num* .
*num* million subscribers and service coverage in most major cities , *num* districts , and all *num* provincial capitals .
with over $400 million in total investment , mtn offers mobile voice , sms , mms , srs , gprs , fax , voicemail and pco services through prepaid , postpaid and corporate tariffs .
mtn has interconnection agreements with all national telecom operators and provides international voice and sms roaming in *num* countries and across *num* operators through prepaid and postpaid roaming tariffs .
mtn also has a national isp license which the company received in november *num* .
mtn was the first company to introduce the popular per-second billing system in the country ( also known as “pay as you talk” ) allowing its subscribers to transparently track their talk-time and receive billing summaries via sms .
the scheme was so popular that other gsm companies quickly adopted this method .
afghanistan was given legal control of the " .
af " domain in *num* , and the afghanistan network information center ( afgnic ) was established to administer domain names .
as of *num* , there are at least *num* internet service providers ( isps ) in the country .
internet in afghanistan is also at the peak with over *num* million users as of *num* .
according to the ministry of communications , the following are some of the different isps operating in afghanistan : there are over *num* television operators in afghanistan and *num* television transmitters , many of which are based kabul , while others are broadcast from other provinces .
selected foreign channels are also shown to the public in afghanistan , but with the use of the internet , over *num* , *num* international tv channels may be accessed in afghanistan .
there are an estimated *num* fm radio operators throughout the country .
broadcasts are in dari , pashto , english , uzbeki and a number of other languages .
radio listeners are generally decreasing and are being slowly outnumbered by television .
of afghanistan's *num* main cities , kandahar and khost have the maximum number of radio listeners .
kabul and jalalabad have moderate number of listeners .
however , mazar-e-sharif and especially herat have very few radio listeners .
in *num* , a central post office was established at bala hissar in kabul and a post office in the capital of each province .
the service was slowly being expanded over the years as more postal offices were established in each large city by *num* .
afghanistan became a member of the universal postal union in *num* , and the postal administration elevated to the ministry of communication in *num* .
civil war caused a disruption in issuing official stamps during the 1980s-90s war but in *num* postal service was operating again .
postal services to / from kabul worked remarkably well all throughout the war years .
postal services to / from herat resumed in *num* .
the afghan government has reported to the upu several times about illegal stamps being issued and sold in *num* and *num* .
afghanistan post has been reorganizing the postal service in 2000s with assistance from pakistan post .
the afghanistan postal commission was formed to prepare a written policy for the development of the postal sector , which will form the basis of a new postal services law governing licensing of postal services providers .
the project was expected to finish by *num* .
in january *num* the afghan ministry of communications and information technology signed an agreement with eutelsat for the use of satellite resources to enhance deployment of afghanistan's national broadcasting and telecommunications infrastructure as well as its international connectivity .
afghansat *num* was officially launched in may *num* , with expected service for at least seven years in afghanistan .
the afghan government plans to launch afghansat *num* after the lease of afghansat *num* ends .
books of the bible different religious groups include different books in their biblical canons , in varying orders , and sometimes divide or combine books .
the jewish tanakh ( sometimes called the hebrew bible ) contains *num* books divided into three parts : the five books of the " torah " ( " teaching " ) ; the eight books of the " nevi'im " ( " prophets " ) ; and the eleven books of " ketuvim " ( " writings " ) .
it is composed mainly in biblical hebrew , and its masoretic text is the main textual source for the christian greek old testament .
christian bibles range from the *num* books of the catholic church canon , the *num* books of the canon of some denominations or the *num* books of the canon of other denominations of the protestant church , to the *num* books of the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church canon .
the first part of christian bibles is the greek old testament , which contains , at minimum , the above *num* books of the tanakh but divided into *num* books and ordered differently .
the second part is the greek new testament , containing *num* books ; the four canonical gospels , acts of the apostles , *num* epistles or letters and the book of revelation .
the catholic church and eastern christian churches hold that certain deuterocanonical books and passages are part of the old testament canon .
the eastern orthodox , oriental orthodox , and assyrian christian churches may have minor differences in their lists of accepted books .
the list given here for these churches is the most inclusive : if at least one eastern church accepts the book it is included here .
the king james bible—which has been called " the most influential version of the most influential book in the world , in what is now its most influential language " and which in the united states is the most used translation , being still considered a standard among protestant churches and being used liturgically in the orthodox church in america—contains *num* books : *num* in its old testament , *num* in its apocrypha , and *num* in its new testament .
rabbinic judaism recognizes the *num* books of the masoretic text , commonly called the " tanakh " or hebrew bible , as authoritative .
there is no scholarly consensus as to when the hebrew bible canon was fixed : some scholars argue that it was fixed by the hasmonean dynasty ( 140-40 bce ) , while others argue it was not fixed until the second century ce or even later .
most conservative scholars believe that the torah was canonized c .
*num* bce , the prophets c .
*num* bce , and the writings c .
*num* ce , perhaps at a council of jamnia as concluded by heinrich graetz in *num* .
the council of jamnia theory is increasingly rejected by most liberal scholars .
protestants and catholics use the masoretic text of the jewish tanakh as the textual basis for their translations of the protocanonical books ( those accepted as canonical by both jews and all christians ) , with various changes derived from a multiplicity of other ancient sources ( such as the septuagint , the vulgate , the dead sea scrolls , etc .
) , while generally using the septuagint and vulgate , now supplemented by the ancient hebrew and aramaic manuscripts , as the textual basis for the deuterocanonical books .
the eastern orthodox use the septuagint ( translated in the *ord* century bce ) as the textual basis for the entire old testament in both protocanonical and deuteroncanonical books—to use both in the greek for liturgical purposes , and as the basis for translations into the vernacular .
most of the quotations ( *num* of *num* ) of the old testament in the new testament , while differing more or less from the version presented by the masoretic text , align with that of the septuagint .
these books , which were largely written during the intertestamental period , are called the biblical apocrypha ( " hidden things " ) by protestants , the deuterocanon ( " second canon " ) by catholics , and the deuterocanon or " anagignoskomena " ( " worthy of reading " ) by orthodox .
these are works recognized by the roman catholic , eastern orthodox , and oriental orthodox churches as being part of scripture ( and thus deuterocanonical rather than apocryphal ) , but protestants do not recognize them as divinely inspired .
orthodox differentiate scriptural books by omitting these ( and others ) from corporate worship and from use as a sole basis for doctrine .
many recognize them as good , but not on the level of the other books of the bible .
anglicanism considers the apocrypha worthy of being " read for example of life " but not to be used " to establish any doctrine .
" luther made a parallel statement in calling them : " not considered equal to the holy scriptures , but .
.
.
useful and good to read .
" the difference in canons derives from the difference in the masoretic text and the septuagint .
books found in both the hebrew and the greek are accepted by all denominations , and by jews , these are the protocanonical books .
catholics and orthodox also accept those books present in manuscripts of the septuagint , an ancient greek translation of the old testament with great currency among the jews of the ancient world , with the coda that catholics consider *num* esdras and *num* maccabees apocryphal .
most quotations of the old testament in the new testament , differing by varying degrees from the masoretic text , are taken from the septuagint .
daniel was written several hundred years after the time of ezra , and since that time several books of the septuagint have been found in the original hebrew , in the dead sea scrolls , the cairo geniza , and at masada , including a hebrew text of sirach ( qumran , masada ) and an aramaic text of tobit ( qumran ) ; the additions to esther and daniel are also in their respective semitic languages .
the unanimous consensus of modern ( and ancient ) scholars consider several other books , including *num* maccabees and judith , to have been composed in hebrew or aramaic .
opinion is divided on the book of baruch , while it is acknowledged that the letter of jeremiah , the wisdom of solomon , and *num* maccabees are originally greek compositions .
additional books accepted by the eastern orthodox : additional books accepted by the syriac orthodox church ( due to inclusion in the peshitta ) : the ethiopian tewahedo church accepts all of the deuterocanonical books of catholicism and anagignoskomena of eastern orthodoxy except for the four books of maccabees .
it accepts the *num* protocanonical books along with the following books , called the " narrow canon " .
the enumeration of books in the ethiopic bible varies greatly between different authorities and printings .
the table uses the spellings and names present in modern editions of the bible , such as the new american bible revised edition , revised standard version and english standard version .
the spelling and names in both the 1609–1610 douay old testament ( and in the *num* rheims new testament ) and the *num* revision by bishop challoner ( the edition currently in print used by many catholics , and the source of traditional catholic spellings in english ) and in the septuagint differ from those spellings and names used in modern editions that derive from the hebrew masoretic text .
for the orthodox canon , septuagint titles are provided in parentheses when these differ from those editions .
for the catholic canon , the douaic titles are provided in parentheses when these differ from those editions .
likewise , the king james version references some of these books by the traditional spelling when referring to them in the new testament , such as " esaias " ( for isaiah ) .
in the spirit of ecumenism more recent catholic translations ( e .
g .
, the new american bible , jerusalem bible , and ecumenical translations used by catholics , such as the revised standard version catholic edition ) use the same " standardized " ( king james version ) spellings and names as protestant bibles ( e .
g .
, *num* chronicles , as opposed to the douaic *num* paralipomenon , 1-2 samuel and 1-2 kings , instead of 1-4 kings ) in those books universally considered canonical—the protocanonicals .
the talmud in bava batra 14b gives a different order for the books in " nevi'im " and " ketuvim " .
this order is also quoted in mishneh torah hilchot sefer torah *num* : *num* .
the order of the books of the torah are universal through all denominations of judaism and christianity .
the disputed books , included in one canon but not in others , are often called the biblical apocrypha , a term that is sometimes used specifically to describe the books in the catholic and orthodox canons that are absent from the jewish masoretic text and most modern protestant bibles .
catholics , following the canon of trent ( *num* ) , describe these books as deuterocanonical , while greek orthodox christians , following the synod of jerusalem ( *num* ) , use the traditional name of " anagignoskomena " , meaning " that which is to be read .
" they are present in a few historic protestant versions ; the german luther bible included such books , as did the english *num* king james version .
empty table cells indicate that a book is absent from that canon .
several of the books in the eastern orthodox canon are also found in the appendix to the latin vulgate , formerly the official bible of the roman catholic church .
in general , among christian denominations , the new testament canon is an agreed-upon list of *num* books , although book order can vary .
the book order is the same in the greek orthodox , roman catholic , and protestant traditions .
the slavonic , armenian and ethiopian traditions have different new testament book orders .
apoptosis apoptosis ( from ancient greek ἀπόπτωσις " falling off " ) is a form of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms .
biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes ( morphology ) and death .
these changes include blebbing , cell shrinkage , nuclear fragmentation , chromatin condensation , chromosomal dna fragmentation , and global mrna decay .
the average adult human loses between *num* and *num* billion cells each day due to apoptosis .
for an average human child between the ages of *num* to *num* year old approximately *num* to *num* billion cells die per day .
in contrast to necrosis , which is a form of traumatic cell death that results from acute cellular injury , apoptosis is a highly regulated and controlled process that confers advantages during an organism's lifecycle .
for example , the separation of fingers and toes in a developing human embryo occurs because cells between the digits undergo apoptosis .
unlike necrosis , apoptosis produces cell fragments called apoptotic bodies that phagocytic cells are able to engulf and remove before the contents of the cell can spill out onto surrounding cells and cause damage to them .
because apoptosis cannot stop once it has begun , it is a highly regulated process .
apoptosis can be initiated through one of two pathways .
in the " intrinsic pathway " the cell kills itself because it senses cell stress , while in the " extrinsic pathway " the cell kills itself because of signals from other cells .
weak external signals may also activate the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis .
both pathways induce cell death by activating caspases , which are proteases , or enzymes that degrade proteins .
the two pathways both activate initiator caspases , which then activate executioner caspases , which then kill the cell by degrading proteins indiscriminately .
research on apoptosis has increased substantially since the early 1990s .
in addition to its importance as a biological phenomenon , defective apoptotic processes have been implicated in a wide variety of diseases .
excessive apoptosis causes atrophy , whereas an insufficient amount results in uncontrolled cell proliferation , such as cancer .
some factors like fas receptors and caspases promote apoptosis , while some members of the bcl-2 family of proteins inhibit apoptosis .
german scientist karl vogt was first to describe the principle of apoptosis in *num* .
in *num* , anatomist walther flemming delivered a more precise description of the process of programmed cell death .
however , it was not until *num* that the topic was resurrected .
while studying tissues using electron microscopy , john foxton ross kerr at the university of queensland was able to distinguish apoptosis from traumatic cell death .
following the publication of a paper describing the phenomenon , kerr was invited to join alastair r .
currie , as well as andrew wyllie , who was currie's graduate student , at university of aberdeen .
in *num* , the trio published a seminal article in the british journal of cancer .
kerr had initially used the term programmed cell necrosis , but in the article , the process of natural cell death was called " apoptosis " .
kerr , wyllie and currie credited james cormack , a professor of greek language at university of aberdeen , with suggesting the term apoptosis .
kerr received the paul ehrlich and ludwig darmstaedter prize on march *num* , *num* , for his description of apoptosis .
he shared the prize with boston biologist h .
robert horvitz .
for many years , neither " apoptosis " nor " programmed cell death " was a highly cited term .
two discoveries brought cell death from obscurity to a major field of research : identification of components of the cell death control and effector mechanisms , and linkage of abnormalities in cell death to human disease , in particular cancer .
the *num* nobel prize in medicine was awarded to sydney brenner , horvitz and john e .
sulston for their work identifying genes that control apoptosis .
the genes were identified by studies in the nematode " c .
elegans " and homologues of these genes function in humans to regulate apoptosis .
in greek , apoptosis translates to the " falling off " of leaves from a tree .
cormack , professor of greek language , reintroduced the term for medical use as it had a medical meaning for the greeks over two thousand years before .
hippocrates used the term to mean " the falling off of the bones " .
galen extended its meaning to " the dropping of the scabs " .
cormack was no doubt aware of this usage when he suggested the name .
debate continues over the correct pronunciation , with opinion divided between a pronunciation with the second " p " silent ( ) and the second " p " pronounced ( ) , as in the original greek .
in english , the " p " of the greek " -pt- " consonant cluster is typically silent at the beginning of a word ( e .
g .
pterodactyl , ptolemy ) , but articulated when used in combining forms preceded by a vowel , as in helicopter or the orders of insects : diptera , lepidoptera , etc .
in the original kerr , wyllie & currie paper , there is a footnote regarding the pronunciation : "we are most grateful to professor james cormack of the department of greek , university of aberdeen , for suggesting this term .
the word " apoptosis " ( ) is used in greek to describe the " dropping off " or " falling off " of petals from flowers , or leaves from trees .
to show the derivation clearly , we propose that the stress should be on the penultimate syllable , the second half of the word being pronounced like " ptosis " ( with the " p " silent ) , which comes from the same root " to fall " , and is already used to describe the drooping of the upper eyelid .
" the initiation of apoptosis is tightly regulated by activation mechanisms , because once apoptosis has begun , it inevitably leads to the death of the cell .
the two best-understood activation mechanisms are the intrinsic pathway ( also called the mitochondrial pathway ) and the extrinsic pathway .
the " intrinsic pathway " is activated by intracellular signals generated when cells are stressed and depends on the release of proteins from the intermembrane space of mitochondria .
the " extrinsic pathway " is activated by extracellular ligands binding to cell-surface death receptors , which leads to the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex ( disc ) .
a cell initiates intracellular apoptotic signaling in response to a stress , which may bring about cell suicide .
the binding of nuclear receptors by glucocorticoids , heat , radiation , nutrient deprivation , viral infection , hypoxia , increased intracellular concentration of free fatty acids and increased intracellular calcium concentration , for example , by damage to the membrane , can all trigger the release of intracellular apoptotic signals by a damaged cell .
a number of cellular components , such as poly adp ribose polymerase , may also help regulate apoptosis .
single cell fluctuations have been observed in experimental studies of stress induced apoptosis .
before the actual process of cell death is precipitated by enzymes , apoptotic signals must cause regulatory proteins to initiate the apoptosis pathway .
this step allows those signals to cause cell death , or the process to be stopped , should the cell no longer need to die .
several proteins are involved , but two main methods of regulation have been identified : the targeting of mitochondria functionality , or directly transducing the signal via adaptor proteins to the apoptotic mechanisms .
an extrinsic pathway for initiation identified in several toxin studies is an increase in calcium concentration within a cell caused by drug activity , which also can cause apoptosis via a calcium binding protease calpain .
the mitochondria are essential to multicellular life .
without them , a cell ceases to respire aerobically and quickly dies .
this fact forms the basis for some apoptotic pathways .
apoptotic proteins that target mitochondria affect them in different ways .
they may cause mitochondrial swelling through the formation of membrane pores , or they may increase the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and cause apoptotic effectors to leak out .
they are very closely related to intrinsic pathway , and tumors arise more frequently through intrinsic pathway than the extrinsic pathway because of sensitivity .
there is also a growing body of evidence indicating that nitric oxide is able to induce apoptosis by helping to dissipate the membrane potential of mitochondria and therefore make it more permeable .
nitric oxide has been implicated in initiating and inhibiting apoptosis through its possible action as a signal molecule of subsequent pathways that activate apoptosis .
mitochondrial proteins known as smacs ( second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases ) are released into the cell's cytosol following the increase in permeability of the mitochondria membranes .
smac binds to " proteins that inhibit apoptosis " ( iaps ) thereby deactivating them , and preventing the iaps from arresting the process and therefore allowing apoptosis to proceed .
iap also normally suppresses the activity of a group of cysteine proteases called caspases , which carry out the degradation of the cell .
therefore , the actual degradation enzymes can be seen to be indirectly regulated by mitochondrial permeability .
cytochrome c is also released from mitochondria due to formation of a channel , the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel ( mac ) , in the outer mitochondrial membrane , and serves a regulatory function as it precedes morphological change associated with apoptosis .
once cytochrome c is released it binds with apoptotic protease activating factor – *num* ( " apaf-1 " ) and atp , which then bind to " pro-caspase-9 " to create a protein complex known as an apoptosome .
the apoptosome cleaves the pro-caspase to its active form of caspase-9 , which in turn activates the effector " caspase-3 " .
mac ( not to be confused with the membrane attack complex formed by complement activation , also commonly denoted as mac ) , also called " mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization pore " is regulated by various proteins , such as those encoded by the mammalian bcl-2 family of anti-apoptopic genes , the homologs of the " ced-9 " gene found in " c .
elegans " .
" bcl-2 " proteins are able to promote or inhibit apoptosis by direct action on mac / mompp .
bax and / or bak form the pore , while bcl-2 , bcl-xl or mcl-1 inhibit its formation .
two theories of the direct initiation of apoptotic mechanisms in mammals have been suggested : the " tnf-induced " ( tumor necrosis factor ) model and the " fas-fas ligand-mediated " model , both involving receptors of the " tnf receptor " ( tnfr ) family coupled to extrinsic signals .
tnf-alpha is a cytokine produced mainly by activated macrophages , and is the major extrinsic mediator of apoptosis .
most cells in the human body have two receptors for tnf-alpha : tnfr1 and tnfr2 .
the binding of tnf-alpha to tnfr1 has been shown to initiate the pathway that leads to caspase activation via the intermediate membrane proteins tnf receptor-associated death domain ( tradd ) and fas-associated death domain protein ( fadd ) .
ciap1 / *num* can inhibit tnf-α signaling by binding to traf2 .
flip inhibits the activation of caspase-8 .
binding of this receptor can also indirectly lead to the activation of transcription factors involved in cell survival and inflammatory responses .
however , signalling through tnfr1 might also induce apoptosis in a caspase-independent manner .
the link between tnf-alpha and apoptosis shows why an abnormal production of tnf-alpha plays a fundamental role in several human diseases , especially in autoimmune diseases .
the fas receptor ( first apoptosis signal ) – ( also known as " apo-1 " or " cd95 " ) is a transmembrane protein of the tnf family which binds the fas ligand ( fasl ) .
the interaction between fas and fasl results in the formation of the " death-inducing signaling complex " ( disc ) , which contains the fadd , caspase-8 and caspase-10 .
in some types of cells ( type i ) , processed caspase-8 directly activates other members of the caspase family , and triggers the execution of apoptosis of the cell .
in other types of cells ( type ii ) , the " fas"-disc starts a feedback loop that spirals into increasing release of proapoptotic factors from mitochondria and the amplified activation of caspase-8 .
following " tnf-r1 " and " fas " activation in mammalian cells a balance between proapoptotic ( bax , bid , bak , or bad ) and anti-apoptotic ( " bcl-xl " and " bcl-2 " ) members of the " bcl-2 " family are established .
this balance is the proportion of proapoptotic homodimers that form in the outer-membrane of the mitochondrion .
the proapoptotic homodimers are required to make the mitochondrial membrane permeable for the release of caspase activators such as cytochrome c and smac .
control of proapoptotic proteins under normal cell conditions of nonapoptotic cells is incompletely understood , but in general , bax or bak are activated by the activation of bh3-only proteins , part of the bcl-2 family .
caspases play the central role in the transduction of er apoptotic signals .
caspases are proteins that are highly conserved , cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases .
there are two types of caspases : initiator caspases , caspase *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , and effector caspases , caspase *num* , *num* , *num* .
the activation of initiator caspases requires binding to specific oligomeric activator protein .
effector caspases are then activated by these active initiator caspases through proteolytic cleavage .
the active effector caspases then proteolytically degrade a host of intracellular proteins to carry out the cell death program .
there also exists a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway that is mediated by aif ( apoptosis-inducing factor ) .
amphibian frog " xenopus laevis " serves as an ideal model system for the study of the mechanisms of apoptosis .
in fact , iodine and thyroxine also stimulate the spectacular apoptosis of the cells of the larval gills , tail and fins in amphibians metamorphosis , and stimulate the evolution of their nervous system transforming the aquatic , vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial , carnivorous frog .
negative regulation of apoptosis inhibits cell death signaling pathways , helping tumors to evade cell death and developing drug resistance .
many families of proteins act as negative regulators categorized into either antiapoptotic factors , such as iaps and bcl-2 proteins or prosurvival factors like cflip , bnip3 , fadd , akt , and nf-κb .
many pathways and signals lead to apoptosis , but these converge on a single mechanism that actually causes the death of the cell .
after a cell receives stimulus , it undergoes organized degradation of cellular organelles by activated proteolytic caspases .
in addition to the destruction of cellular organelles , mrna is rapidly and globally degraded by a mechanism that is not yet fully characterized .
mrna decay is triggered very early in apoptosis .
a cell undergoing apoptosis shows a series of characteristic morphological changes .
early alterations include : apoptosis progresses quickly and its products are quickly removed , making it difficult to detect or visualize on classical histology sections .
during karyorrhexis , endonuclease activation leaves short dna fragments , regularly spaced in size .
these give a characteristic " laddered " appearance on agar gel after electrophoresis .
tests for dna laddering differentiate apoptosis from ischemic or toxic cell death .
before the apoptotic cell is disposed of , there is a process of disassembly .
there are three recognized steps in apoptotic cell disassembly : the removal of dead cells by neighboring phagocytic cells has been termed efferocytosis .
dying cells that undergo the final stages of apoptosis display phagocytotic molecules , such as phosphatidylserine , on their cell surface .
phosphatidylserine is normally found on the inner leaflet surface of the plasma membrane , but is redistributed during apoptosis to the extracellular surface by a protein known as scramblase .
these molecules mark the cell for phagocytosis by cells possessing the appropriate receptors , such as macrophages .
the removal of dying cells by phagocytes occurs in an orderly manner without eliciting an inflammatory response .
during apoptosis cellular rna and dna are separated from each other and sorted to different apoptotic bodies ; separation of rna is initiated as nucleolar segregation .
many knock-outs have been made in the apoptosis pathways to test the function of each of the proteins .
several caspases , in addition to apaf1 and fadd , have been mutated to determine the new phenotype .
in order to create a tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) knockout , an exon containing the nucleotides 3704–5364 was removed from the gene .
this exon encodes a portion of the mature tnf domain , as well as the leader sequence , which is a highly conserved region necessary for proper intracellular processing .
tnf- / - mice develop normally and have no gross structural or morphological abnormalities .
however , upon immunization with srbc ( sheep red blood cells ) , these mice demonstrated a deficiency in the maturation of an antibody response ; they were able to generate normal levels of igm , but could not develop specific igg levels .
apaf-1 is the protein that turns on caspase *num* by cleavage to begin the caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis .
since a - / - mutation in the apaf-1 gene is embryonic lethal , a gene trap strategy was used in order to generate an apaf-1 - / - mouse .
this assay is used to disrupt gene function by creating an intragenic gene fusion .
when an apaf-1 gene trap is introduced into cells , many morphological changes occur , such as spina bifida , the persistence of interdigital webs , and open brain .
in addition , after embryonic day *num* .
*num* , the brain of the embryos showed several structural changes .
apaf-1 cells are protected from apoptosis stimuli such as irradiation .
a bax-1 knock-out mouse exhibits normal forebrain formation and a decreased programmed cell death in some neuronal populations and in the spinal cord , leading to an increase in motor neurons .
the caspase proteins are integral parts of the apoptosis pathway , so it follows that knock-outs made have varying damaging results .
a caspase *num* knock-out leads to a severe brain malformation .
a caspase *num* knock-out leads to cardiac failure and thus embryonic lethality .
however , with the use of cre-lox technology , a caspase *num* knock-out has been created that exhibits an increase in peripheral t cells , an impaired t cell response , and a defect in neural tube closure .
these mice were found to be resistant to apoptosis mediated by cd95 , tnfr , etc .
but not resistant to apoptosis caused by uv irradiation , chemotherapeutic drugs , and other stimuli .
finally , a caspase *num* knock-out was characterized by ectopic cell masses in the brain and abnormal apoptotic features such as membrane blebbing or nuclear fragmentation .
a remarkable feature of these ko mice is that they have a very restricted phenotype : casp3 , *num* , apaf-1 ko mice have deformations of neural tissue and fadd and casp *num* ko showed defective heart development , however in both types of ko other organs developed normally and some cell types were still sensitive to apoptotic stimuli suggesting that unknown proapoptotic pathways exist .
in order to perform analysis of apoptotic versus necrotic ( necroptotic ) cells , one can do analysis of morphology by time-lapse microscopy , flow fluorocytometry , and transmission electron microscopy .
there are also various biochemical techniques for analysis of cell surface markers ( phosphatidylserine exposure versus cell permeability by flow cytometry ) , cellular markers such as dna fragmentation ( flow cytometry ) , caspase activation , bid cleavage , and cytochrome c release ( western blotting ) .
it is important to know how primary and secondary necrotic cells can be distinguished by analysis of supernatant for caspases , hmgb1 , and release of cytokeratin *num* .
however , no distinct surface or biochemical markers of necrotic cell death have been identified yet , and only negative markers are available .
these include absence of apoptotic markers ( caspase activation , cytochrome c release , and oligonucleosomal dna fragmentation ) and differential kinetics of cell death markers ( phosphatidylserine exposure and cell membrane permeabilization ) .
a selection of techniques that can be used to distinguish apoptosis from necroptotic cells could be found in these references .
the many different types of apoptotic pathways contain a multitude of different biochemical components , many of them not yet understood .
as a pathway is more or less sequential in nature , removing or modifying one component leads to an effect in another .
in a living organism , this can have disastrous effects , often in the form of disease or disorder .
a discussion of every disease caused by modification of the various apoptotic pathways would be impractical , but the concept overlying each one is the same : the normal functioning of the pathway has been disrupted in such a way as to impair the ability of the cell to undergo normal apoptosis .
this results in a cell that lives past its " use-by-date " and is able to replicate and pass on any faulty machinery to its progeny , increasing the likelihood of the cell's becoming cancerous or diseased .
a recently described example of this concept in action can be seen in the development of a lung cancer called nci-h460 .
the " x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein " ( xiap ) is overexpressed in cells of the h460 cell line .
xiaps bind to the processed form of caspase-9 , and suppress the activity of apoptotic activator cytochrome c , therefore overexpression leads to a decrease in the amount of proapoptotic agonists .
as a consequence , the balance of anti-apoptotic and proapoptotic effectors is upset in favour of the former , and the damaged cells continue to replicate despite being directed to die .
defects in regulation of apoptosis in cancer cells occur often at the level of control of transcription factors .
as a particular example , defects in molecules that control transcription factor nf-κb in cancer change the mode of transcriptional regulation and the response to apoptotic signals , to curtail dependence on the tissue that the cell belongs .
this degree of independence from external survival signals , can enable cancer metastasis .
the tumor-suppressor protein p53 accumulates when dna is damaged due to a chain of biochemical factors .
part of this pathway includes alpha-interferon and beta-interferon , which induce transcription of the " p53 " gene , resulting in the increase of p53 protein level and enhancement of cancer cell-apoptosis .
p53 prevents the cell from replicating by stopping the cell cycle at g1 , or interphase , to give the cell time to repair , however it will induce apoptosis if damage is extensive and repair efforts fail .
any disruption to the regulation of the " p53 " or interferon genes will result in impaired apoptosis and the possible formation of tumors .
inhibition of apoptosis can result in a number of cancers , autoimmune diseases , inflammatory diseases , and viral infections .
it was originally believed that the associated accumulation of cells was due to an increase in cellular proliferation , but it is now known that it is also due to a decrease in cell death .
the most common of these diseases is cancer , the disease of excessive cellular proliferation , which is often characterized by an overexpression of iap family members .
as a result , the malignant cells experience an abnormal response to apoptosis induction : cycle-regulating genes ( such as p53 , ras or c-myc ) are mutated or inactivated in diseased cells , and further genes ( such as bcl-2 ) also modify their expression in tumors .
some apoptotic factors are vital during mitochondrial respiration e .
g .
cytochrome c .
pathological inactivation of apoptosis in cancer cells is correlated with frequent respiratory metabolic shifts toward glycolysis ( an observation known as the “warburg hypothesis” .
apoptosis in hela cells is inhibited by proteins produced by the cell ; these inhibitory proteins target retinoblastoma tumor-suppressing proteins .
these tumor-suppressing proteins regulate the cell cycle , but are rendered inactive when bound to an inhibitory protein .
hpv e6 and e7 are inhibitory proteins expressed by the human papillomavirus , hpv being responsible for the formation of the cervical tumor from which hela cells are derived .
hpv e6 causes p53 , which regulates the cell cycle , to become inactive .
hpv e7 binds to retinoblastoma tumor suppressing proteins and limits its ability to control cell division .
these two inhibitory proteins are partially responsible for hela cells ' immortality by inhibiting apoptosis to occur .
cdv ( canine distemper virus ) is able to induce apoptosis despite the presence of these inhibitory proteins .
this is an important oncolytic property of cdv : this virus is capable of killing canine lymphoma cells .
oncoproteins e6 and e7 still leave p53 inactive , but they are not able to avoid the activation of caspases induced from the stress of viral infection .
these oncolytic properties provided a promising link between cdv and lymphoma apoptosis , which can lead to development of alternative treatment methods for both canine lymphoma and human non-hodgkin lymphoma .
defects in the cell cycle are thought to be responsible for the resistance to chemotherapy or radiation by certain tumor cells , so a virus that can induce apoptosis despite defects in the cell cycle is useful for cancer treatment .
the main method of treatment for potential death from signaling-related diseases involves either increasing or decreasing the susceptibility of apoptosis in diseased cells , depending on whether the disease is caused by either the inhibition of or excess apoptosis .
for instance , treatments aim to restore apoptosis to treat diseases with deficient cell death , and to increase the apoptotic threshold to treat diseases involved with excessive cell death .
to stimulate apoptosis , one can increase the number of death receptor ligands ( such as tnf or trail ) , antagonize the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 pathway , or introduce smac mimetics to inhibit the inhibitor ( iaps ) .
the addition of agents such as herceptin , iressa , or gleevec works to stop cells from cycling and causes apoptosis activation by blocking growth and survival signaling further upstream .
finally , adding p53-mdm2 complexes displaces p53 and activates the p53 pathway , leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis .
many different methods can be used either to stimulate or to inhibit apoptosis in various places along the death signaling pathway .
apoptosis is a multi-step , multi-pathway cell-death programme that is inherent in every cell of the body .
in cancer , the apoptosis cell-division ratio is altered .
cancer treatment by chemotherapy and irradiation kills target cells primarily by inducing apoptosis .
on the other hand , loss of control of cell death ( resulting in excess apoptosis ) can lead to neurodegenerative diseases , hematologic diseases , and tissue damage .
it is of interest to note that neurons that rely on mitochondrial respiration undergo apoptosis in neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer’s and parkinson’s ( an observation known as the “inverse warburg hypothesis” ) .
moreover , there is an inverse epidemiological comorbidity between neurodegenerative diseases and cancer .
the progression of hiv is directly linked to excess , unregulated apoptosis .
in a healthy individual , the number of cd4+ lymphocytes is in balance with the cells generated by the bone marrow ; however , in hiv-positive patients , this balance is lost due to an inability of the bone marrow to regenerate cd4+ cells .
in the case of hiv , cd4+ lymphocytes die at an accelerated rate through uncontrolled apoptosis , when stimulated .
at the molecular level , hyperactive apoptosis can be caused by defects in signaling pathways that regulate the bcl-2 family proteins .
increased expression of apoptotic proteins such as bim , or their decreased proteolysis , leads to cell death , and can cause a number of pathologies , depending on the cells where excessive activity of bim occurs .
cancer cells can escape apoptosis through mechanisms that suppress bim expression or by increased proteolysis of bim .
treatments aiming to inhibit works to block specific caspases .
finally , the akt protein kinase promotes cell survival through two pathways .
akt phosphorylates and inhibits bad ( a bcl-2 family member ) , causing bad to interact with the 14-3-3 scaffold , resulting in bcl dissociation and thus cell survival .
akt also activates ikkα , which leads to nf-κb activation and cell survival .
active nf-κb induces the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as bcl-2 , resulting in inhibition of apoptosis .
nf-κb has been found to play both an antiapoptotic role and a proapoptotic role depending on the stimuli utilized and the cell type .
the progression of the human immunodeficiency virus infection into aids is due primarily to the depletion of cd4+ t-helper lymphocytes in a manner that is too rapid for the body's bone marrow to replenish the cells , leading to a compromised immune system .
one of the mechanisms by which t-helper cells are depleted is apoptosis , which results from a series of biochemical pathways : cells may also die as direct consequences of viral infections .
hiv-1 expression induces tubular cell g2 / m arrest and apoptosis .
the progression from hiv to aids is not immediate or even necessarily rapid ; hiv's cytotoxic activity toward cd4+ lymphocytes is classified as aids once a given patient's cd4+ cell count falls below *num* .
researchers from kumamoto university in japan have developed a new method to eradicate hiv in viral reservoir cells , named " lock-in and apoptosis .
" using the synthesized compound heptanoylphosphatidyl l-inositol pentakisphophate ( or l-hippo ) to bind strongly to the hiv protein pr55gag , they were able to suppress viral budding .
by suppressing viral budding , the researchers were able to trap the hiv virus in the cell and allow for the cell to undergo apoptosis ( natural cell death ) .
associate professor mikako fujita has stated that the approach is not yet available to hiv patients because the research team has to conduct further research on combining the drug therapy that currently exists with this " lock-in and apoptosis " approach to lead to complete recovery from hiv .
viral induction of apoptosis occurs when one or several cells of a living organism are infected with a virus , leading to cell death .
cell death in organisms is necessary for the normal development of cells and the cell cycle maturation .
it is also important in maintaining the regular functions and activities of cells .
viruses can trigger apoptosis of infected cells via a range of mechanisms including : canine distemper virus ( cdv ) is known to cause apoptosis in central nervous system and lymphoid tissue of infected dogs in vivo and in vitro .
apoptosis caused by cdv is typically induced via the extrinsic pathway , which activates caspases that disrupt cellular function and eventually leads to the cells death .
in normal cells , cdv activates caspase-8 first , which works as the initiator protein followed by the executioner protein caspase-3 .
however , apoptosis induced by cdv in hela cells does not involve the initiator protein caspase-8 .
hela cell apoptosis caused by cdv follows a different mechanism than that in vero cell lines .
this change in the caspase cascade suggests cdv induces apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway , excluding the need for the initiator caspase-8 .
the executioner protein is instead activated by the internal stimuli caused by viral infection not a caspase cascade .
the oropouche virus ( orov ) is found in the family " bunyaviridae " .
the study of apoptosis brought on by " bunyaviridae " was initiated in *num* , when it was observed that apoptosis was induced by the la crosse virus into the kidney cells of baby hamsters and into the brains of baby mice .
orov is a disease that is transmitted between humans by the biting midge ( " culicoides paraensis " ) .
it is referred to as a zoonotic arbovirus and causes febrile illness , characterized by the onset of a sudden fever known as oropouche fever .
the oropouche virus also causes disruption in cultured cells – cells that are cultivated in distinct and specific conditions .
an example of this can be seen in hela cells , whereby the cells begin to degenerate shortly after they are infected .
with the use of gel electrophoresis , it can be observed that orov causes dna fragmentation in hela cells .
it can be interpreted by counting , measuring , and analyzing the cells of the sub / g1 cell population .
when hela cells are infected with orov , the cytochrome c is released from the membrane of the mitochondria , into the cytosol of the cells .
this type of interaction shows that apoptosis is activated via an intrinsic pathway .
in order for apoptosis to occur within orov , viral uncoating , viral internalization , along with the replication of cells is necessary .
apoptosis in some viruses is activated by extracellular stimuli .
however , studies have demonstrated that the orov infection causes apoptosis to be activated through intracellular stimuli and involves the mitochondria .
many viruses encode proteins that can inhibit apoptosis .
several viruses encode viral homologs of bcl-2 .
these homologs can inhibit proapoptotic proteins such as bax and bak , which are essential for the activation of apoptosis .
examples of viral bcl-2 proteins include the epstein-barr virus bhrf1 protein and the adenovirus e1b 19k protein .
some viruses express caspase inhibitors that inhibit caspase activity and an example is the crma protein of cowpox viruses .
whilst a number of viruses can block the effects of tnf and fas .
for example , the m-t2 protein of myxoma viruses can bind tnf preventing it from binding the tnf receptor and inducing a response .
furthermore , many viruses express p53 inhibitors that can bind p53 and inhibit its transcriptional transactivation activity .
as a consequence , p53 cannot induce apoptosis , since it cannot induce the expression of proapoptotic proteins .
the adenovirus e1b-55k protein and the hepatitis b virus hbx protein are examples of viral proteins that can perform such a function .
viruses can remain intact from apoptosis in particular in the latter stages of infection .
they can be exported in the " apoptotic bodies " that pinch off from the surface of the dying cell , and the fact that they are engulfed by phagocytes prevents the initiation of a host response .
this favours the spread of the virus .
programmed cell death in plants has a number of molecular similarities to that of animal apoptosis , but it also has differences , notable ones being the presence of a cell wall and the lack of an immune system that removes the pieces of the dead cell .
instead of an immune response , the dying cell synthesizes substances to break itself down and places them in a vacuole that ruptures as the cell dies .
whether this whole process resembles animal apoptosis closely enough to warrant using the name " apoptosis " ( as opposed to the more general " programmed cell death " ) is unclear .
the characterization of the caspases allowed the development of caspase inhibitors , which can be used to determine whether a cellular process involves active caspases .
using these inhibitors it was discovered that cells can die while displaying a morphology similar to apoptosis without caspase activation .
later studies linked this phenomenon to the release of aif ( apoptosis-inducing factor ) from the mitochondria and its translocation into the nucleus mediated by its nls ( nuclear localization signal ) .
inside the mitochondria , aif is anchored to the inner membrane .
in order to be released , the protein is cleaved by a calcium-dependent calpain protease .

foreign relations of greece as one of the oldest euro-atlantic member states in the region of southeast europe , greece enjoys a prominent geopolitical role as a middle power , due to its political and geographical proximity to europe , asia , the middle east , and africa .
its main allies are the united states , france , italy , bulgaria , the other nato countries , and the european union .
greece also maintains strong diplomatic relations with cyprus , serbia , armenia , albania , egypt , russia and israel , while at the same time focuses at improving further the good relations with the arab world , caucasus , and china .
as member of both the eu and the union for the mediterranean , greece is a key player in the eastern mediterranean region and has encouraged the collaboration between neighbors , as well as promoting the energy triangle , for gas exports to europe .
greece also has the largest economy in the balkans , where it is an important regional investor .
prominent issues in hellenic foreign policy include the claims in the aegean sea and eastern mediterranean by turkey and the turkish occupation of cyprus .
greece has diplomatic relations with almost all the countries in the world , as shown in the map below .
representation through : embassy – greek embassy in another general consulate – liaison office – no representation – greece greece continues to reject the use of the term macedonia or " republic of macedonia " to refer to its northern neighbour .
the greek government opposes the use of the name without any qualification such as ' republic of northern macedonia ' to the post-1991 constitutional name of its northern neighbour , citing historical and territorial concerns resulting from the ambiguity between the terms republic of macedonia , the greek region of macedonia and the ancient kingdom of macedon , which falls within greek macedonia .
greece also objects to the use of the terms " macedonian " to denote ethnic macedonians and the macedonian language , as these terms have a different meaning in greece ( inhabitants of the greek region of macedonia and the macedonian dialect of greek ) .
the dispute has escalated to the highest level of international mediation , involving numerous attempts to achieve a resolution , notably by the united nations .
the provisional reference " the former yugoslav republic of macedonia " ( fyrom ) is still currently used in relations involving states which do not recognise the constitutional name , republic of macedonia .
nevertheless , all the united nations member-states have agreed to accept any final agreement resulting from negotiations between the two countries .
the ongoing dispute has not prevented the two countries from enjoying close trade links and investment levels ( especially from greece ) , but it has generated a great deal of political and academic debate on both sides .
on *num* september *num* the two countries signed the interim accord , whereby greece recognized the republic of macedonia under its provisional reference .
as of august *num* negotiations aimed at resolving the dispute are ongoing .
under greek pressure , the european union and nato agreed that in order for the republic of macedonia to receive an invitation to join these institutions the name dispute must be resolved first .
this resulted in a case at the international court of justice against greece for violation of the interim accord .
the court deemed greece was wrong to block its neighbour's bid to join nato .
no penalties were imposed but it is now politically more difficult for greece to object to its neighbour's any future application to either nato or the eu .
as the island of cyprus was heading towards independence from the united kingdom the greek ( *num* % ) and turkish ( *num* % ) communities became embroiled in bitter inter-communal fighting , partly sponsored by the two " motherlands " .
eoka-b and the turkish resistance organization ( tmt ) were responsible for many atrocities which resulted in cementing tensions and led to total isolation of the communities with turkish cypriots withdrawn into enclaves .
in *num* the us-backed greek junta – in power since *num* – partly in a move to draw attention away from internal turmoil and partly unsatisfied with makarios ' policy in cyprus , on *num* july attempted a coup to replace him with nikos sampson and declare union with greece .
seven days later , turkey launched an invasion of cyprus allegedly to reinstate the constitution but which resulted in blooded conflict , partition of the island and mass ethnic cleansing .

in addition to greek foreign ministry meetings with turkish officials , greece's supreme court prosecutor yiannis tentes launched an emergency inquiry on *num* december , ordering the investigations into the mid-1990s wildfires blamed on arson to be reopened with regard to the initial claims reportedly made by yılmaz .
former head of greek intelligence service leonidas vasilikopoulos said they had received information from their agents in turkey that turkish agents or others were involved in the forest fires on greek islands .
after making the comments in turkish daily newspaper " birgün " , yilmaz said that his words had been distorted and that he was referring to greek agents causing fires in turkey .
however , on thursday *num* , turkish daily " milliyet " published an article referring to a secret report that seemed to support claims made in the interview by mesut yılmaz that secret agents had caused forest fires in greece in the 1990s .

the greek minority was subject to oppression and harassment during enver hoxha's communist rule and along with the rest of albanians was hit hardly by the isolation that the regime imposed and from the economic hardship that followed the fall of communism as well .
the treatment of the minority by the albanian government is strongly linked with the status of greco-albanian relations .

boogie down productions boogie down productions was a hip hop group , originally composed of krs-one , d-nice , and dj scott la rock .
dj scott la rock was murdered on august *num* , *num* , five months after the release of bdp's debut album , " criminal minded " .
the name of the group , boogie down , derives from a nickname for the south bronx section of the bronx , one of the five boroughs of new york city .
the group pioneered the fusion of dancehall reggae and hip hop music and their debut lp " criminal minded " contained frank descriptions of life in the south bronx during the late 1980s , thus setting the stage for what would eventually become gangsta rap .
the membership of bdp changed continuously throughout its existence , the only constant being krs-one .
the group was founded by krs-one and dj scott la rock , with producer lee smith , who was essential in the production of the songs in the group's first album " criminal minded " , being added as a member shortly after .
from those beginnings , bdp members and collaborators included lee smith , scott la rock , d-nice , kenny parker ( younger brother of krs-one ) , just-ice , icu , mcboo , ms .
melodie , heather b .
, scottie morris , tony rahsan , willie d .
, robocop , harmony , dj red alert , jay kramer , d-square , rebekah foster , scott whitehill , scott king , chris tait and sidney mills .
bdp as a group essentially ended because krs-one began recording and performing under his own name rather than the group name .
original member lee smith , who has co-producer credit on the original 12” " south bronx " single , was the last to be inexplicably jettisoned by krs-one and the future new label after scott's death .
in the liner notes on bdp's *num* album " sex and violence " , krs-one writes : " bdp in *num* is krs-one , willie d , and kenny parker ! bdp is not d-nice , jamal-ski , harmony , ms .
melodie , and scottie morris .
they are not down with bdp so stop frontin ' .
" steve " flash " juon of rapreviews .
com claimed that this initiated the ultimate breakup of the group .
see also : krs-one , scott la rock , and d-nice a conflict arose in the late 1980s about the origins of hip-hop , and bdp made conscious efforts in its early work to establish their interpretation of the issue .
the origins of hip-hop to many , including bdp , are believed to be from the bronx .
a rival hip-hop collective known as the juice crew's lyrics were misunderstood to contain a claim in the song " the bridge " that hip hop was directly a result of artists originating from queensbridge .
boogie down and krs retorted angrily with songs such as “the bridge is over” and “south bronx , ” which started one of the first notable hip hop wars as mc shan , marley marl , roxanne shanté and blaq poet all released songs featuring verses personally attacking krs and scott la rock .
the bridge wars , however , were only short-lived , and after the death of scott la rock prior to the group's second album , krs began to concentrate on socially conscious music .
while " criminal minded " contained vivid descriptions of south bronx street life , bdp changed after scott's death .
producer lee smith was dropped and krs-one adopted the teacha moniker and made a deliberate attempt at creating politically and socially conscious hip-hop .
bdp was influential in provoking political and social consciousness in hip-hop however the group was sometimes overshadowed by the political hip hop group public enemy .
the jamaican influence present in " criminal minded " is well illustrated by the use of the " mad mad " or " diseases " riddim started in *num* with reggae star yellowman's song " zunguzung .
" bdp used this riff in the song " remix for p is free , " and it was later resampled by artists such as black star and dead prez .
as an album regarded by many as the start of the gangsta rap movement , " criminal minded " played an important role in reaffirming the social acceptance of having jamaican roots .
bdp referenced reggae in a way that helped to solidify jamaica's place in modern hip-hop culture .
from its start , bdp was impactful in both the development of hip-hop and giving a sincere voice to the reality of life in the south bronx , a section of new york city that is clouded with poverty and crime .
with its debut album " criminal minded " , this early hip-hop group combined the sounds of larock's harsh , spare , reggae-influenced beats and krs-one's long-winded rhyme style on underground classics such as “9mm goes bang” and “south bronx , ” the album's gritty portrait of life on the streets ( as well as the firearms that adorned its cover ) influenced the gangsta rap movement that began in earnest two years later .
the influence of bdp in the creation and development of gangsta rap highlights the cultural significance and impact of the type of music bdp and other early hip-hop artists like it created .
this subgenre of hip-hop is most closely associated with hard-core hip-hop and is widely misinterpreted as promoting violence and gang activity .
this misinterpretation or stigma is closely related to boogie down productions and the general purpose behind their underlying themes of violence .
for instance , the cover art of " criminal minded " displays the two artists in this group brandishing drawn guns and displaying other firearms .
this is not an encouragement of the violence described in bdp's music , but rather a portrayal or hinting at the violence present in the south bronx as a means of expression , escape , and even condemnation .
this album art is not meant to advocate for violence but to challenge the conception of a criminal , to assert that those who are really criminally minded are those who hold power .
this conflicts with the general stigma surrounding gangsta rap , which thrives off of displaying messages of violence in such a way that it doesn’t challenge these social ills , but rather supports them through the culture of the music .
the music of bdp became significantly more politically astute after the death of disc jockey scott la rock , krs-one's mentor and partner .
la rock's death symbolized all of the injustices that bdp reacted to and lyrically described in their music , and thus inspired krs-one , now the only original member left in the group , to become more passionate about the relevance of the message of bdp's music .
he went on to publish four more albums under the title of boogie down productions , and each one was increasingly innovative and expanded from the thuggish imagery of " criminal minded " and began to explore themes like black-on-black crime , and black radicalism , using a riff on the words of malcolm x , “by any means necessary” , which became the title of the second bdp album , and still remains as one of the most political hip-hop albums to date .
it was in this album where krs defined himself as the “teacha” or “teacher” symbolizing his emphasis on educating his audience members and fans about relevant social issues surrounding the african-american experience .
during his time in association with boogie down productions , krs-one joined with other rappers to create the stop the violence movement , which addressed many of the issues brought about through bdp's music and is the most conscious effort displayed by krs-one and boogie down productions of political activism and engagement .
the movement created the single “self-destruction” in *num* through the collaboration of hip-hop artists boogie down productions ( krs-one , d-nice & ms .
melodie ) , stetsasonic ( delite , daddy-o , wise , and frukwan ) , kool moe dee , mc lyte , doug e .
fresh , just-ice , heavy d , biz markie , public enemy ( chuck d & flavor flav ) with the aim of spreading awareness about violence throughout african-american and hip-hop communities .
all proceeds from this effort went to the national urban league .
circuit zandvoort circuit zandvoort ( ; known as circuit park zandvoort until *num* ) is a motorsport race track located in the dunes north of zandvoort , netherlands , near the north sea coast line .
there were plans for races at zandvoort before world war ii : the first street race was held on *num* june *num* .
however , a permanent race track was not constructed until after the war , using communications roads built by the occupying german army .
contrary to popular belief john hugenholtz cannot be credited with the design of the zandvoort track , although he was involved as the chairman of the nederlandse automobiel ren club ( dutch auto racing club ) before becoming the first track director in *num* .
instead , it was *num* le mans winner , s .
c .
h .
" sammy " davis who was brought in as a track design advisor in july *num* although the layout was partly dictated by the existing roads .
the first race on the circuit , the " prijs van zandvoort " , took place on *num* august *num* .
the race was renamed the " grote prijs van zandvoort " ( zandvoort grand prix ) in *num* , then the " grote prijs van nederland " ( dutch grand prix ) in *num* .
the *num* race was the first to be run as a round of the world drivers ' championship , albeit to formula two regulations rather than formula one regulations like all the championship grands prix that year ; a similar situation also applied to the *num* .
there was no dutch grand prix in *num* , *num* or *num* , but *num* saw the first true formula one race as part of the drivers ' championship .
the dutch grand prix returned in *num* and remained a permanent fixture on the f1 calendar ( with the exception of *num* ) until , when it was held for the last time .
to solve a number of problems that had made it impossible to develop and upgrade the track , the most important one being noise pollution for the inhabitants of the part of zandvoort closest to the track , the track management adopted and developed a plan to move the most southern part of the track away from the housing estate and rebuild a more compact track in the remaining former ' infield ' .
in january *num* this plan got the necessary ' green light ' when it was formally approved by the noord-holland provincial council .
however , only a couple of months later a new problem arose : the company that commercially ran the circuit ( cenav ) , called in the receiver and went out of business , marking the end of " circuit van zandvoort " .
again the track , owned by the municipality of zandvoort , was in danger of being permanently lost for motorsports .
however , a new operating company , the stichting exploitatie circuit park , was formed and started work at the realization of the track's reconstruction plans .
circuit park zandvoort was born and in the summer of *num* the track was remodeled to an interim club circuit of , while the disposed southern part of the track was used to build a vendorado bungalow park and new premises for the local football and hockey clubs .
in *num* , cpz ( " circuit park zandvoort " ) got the " a status " of the dutch government and began building an international grand prix circuit .
this project was finished in *num* when , after the track was redesigned to a long circuit and a new pits building was realized ( by hpg , the development company of john hugenholtz jr , son of the former director ) , a new grandstand was situated along the long straight .
one of the major events that is held at the circuit , along with dtm and a1gp , is the rtl masters of formula *num* , where formula three cars of several national racing series compete with each other ( originally called marlboro masters , before tobacco advertising ban ) .
a noise restriction order was responsible for this event moving to the belgian circuit zolder for *num* and *num* .
however , the race returned to its historical home in *num* .
circuit park zandvoort played host to the first race in the *num* / *num* season of a1 grand prix from *num* september–1 october *num* .
on *num* august *num* , the official a1gp site reported that the *num* / *num* season's first race has moved from the mugello circuit , italy to zandvoort on the 4–5 october *num* due to the delay in the building the new chassis for the new race cars .
the dutch round moved to tt circuit assen in *num* .
a1gp bankrupted before its fifth season and the dutch round was replaced with superleague formula .
in november *num* media brought the news that the formula one racing organisation has invited the owners of the zandvoort race track to make a concrete proposal to stage a grand prix race in *num* .
the circuit gained popularity because of its fast , sweeping corners such as scheivlak as well as the " tarzanbocht " ( tarzan corner ) hairpin at the end of the start / finish straight .
tarzanbocht is the most famous corner in the circuit .
since there is a camber in the corner , it provides excellent overtaking opportunities .
it is possible to pass around the outside as well as the easier inside lane .
this corner is reportedly named after a local character who had earned the nickname of tarzan and only wanted to give up his vegetable garden in the dunes if the track's designers named a nearby corner after him .
on the other hand , many different stories about tarzan corner are known .
the circuit design has been modified and altered several times : the corners are named as follows ( the numbers correspond to the map in this section , starting at the start / finish line ) : the elevation difference is .
in the history of the circuit , several fatal accidents have occurred .
in august *num* a *ord* world championships road race ( men ) was held here .
andré darrigade of france won the race , tom simpson ( britain ) was *ord* .
since *num* , the course has been used as the venue for the runner's world zandvoort circuit run , a 5-kilometre road running competition .
the *num* edition of the race attracted lornah kiplagat , a multiple world champion , who won the ladies *num* km race .

cointelpro cointelpro ( portmanteau derived from counter intelligence program ) ( 1956–1971 ) was a series of covert , and at times illegal , projects conducted by the united states federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) aimed at surveilling , infiltrating , discrediting , and disrupting domestic political organizations .
fbi records show that cointelpro resources targeted groups and individuals that the fbi deemed subversive , including the communist party usa , anti–vietnam war organizers , activists of the civil rights movement or black power movement ( e .
g .
martin luther king jr .
, the nation of islam , and the black panther party ) , feminist organizations , the american indian movement ( aim ) , independence movements ( such as puerto rican independence groups like the young lords ) , and a variety of organizations that were part of the broader new left .
the program also targeted the ku klux klan , though these efforts were later admitted to be disingenuous .
the fbi also financed , armed , and controlled an extreme right-wing group of former members of the minutemen anti-communist para-military organization , transforming it into a group called the secret army organization that targeted groups , activists , and leaders involved in the anti-war movement , using both intimidation and violent acts .
the fbi has used covert operations against domestic political groups since its inception ; however , covert operations under the official cointelpro label took place between *num* and *num* .
cointelpro tactics are still used to this day , and have been alleged to include discrediting targets through psychological warfare ; smearing individuals and groups using forged documents and by planting false reports in the media ; harassment ; wrongful imprisonment ; and illegal violence , including assassination .
the fbi's stated motivation was " protecting national security , preventing violence , and maintaining the existing social and political order .
" beginning in *num* , leaders of the black panther party were targeted by the cointelpro and " neutralized " by being murdered , assassinated , imprisoned , publicly humiliated or falsely charged with crimes .
some of the black panthers affected included fred hampton , mark clark , zayd shakur , geronimo pratt , mumia abu-jamal , and marshall conway .
common tactics used by cointelpro were perjury , witness harassment , witness intimidation , and withholding of evidence .
fbi director j .
edgar hoover issued directives governing cointelpro , ordering fbi agents to " expose , disrupt , misdirect , discredit , or otherwise neutralize " the activities of these movements and especially their leaders .
under hoover , the agent in charge of cointelpro was william c .
sullivan .
attorney general robert f .
kennedy personally authorized some of the programs .
although kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of martin luther king's phones " on a trial basis , for a month or so " , hoover extended the clearance so his men were " unshackled " to look for evidence in any areas of king's life they deemed worthy .
internal documents dated as late as *num* , showed that the fbi had continued to engage in similar programs by surveilling the black lives matter movement .
centralized operations under cointelpro officially began in august *num* with a program designed to " increase factionalism , cause disruption and win defections " inside the communist party usa ( cpusa ) .
tactics included anonymous phone calls , internal revenue service ( irs ) audits , and the creation of documents that would divide the american communist organization internally .
an october *num* memo from hoover reclassified the fbi's ongoing surveillance of black leaders , including it within cointelpro , with the justification that the movement was infiltrated by communists .
in *num* , hoover sent an open letter denouncing dr .
t .
r .
m .
howard , a civil rights leader , surgeon , and wealthy entrepreneur in mississippi who had criticized fbi inaction in solving recent murders of george w .
lee , emmett till , and other african americans in the south .
when the southern christian leadership conference ( sclc ) , an african-american civil rights organization , was founded in *num* , the fbi began to monitor and target the group almost immediately , focusing particularly on bayard rustin , stanley levison , and eventually martin luther king jr .
after the *num* march on washington for jobs and freedom , hoover singled out king as a major target for cointelpro .
under pressure from hoover to focus on king , sullivan wrote : in the light of king's powerful demagogic speech .
.
.
.
we must mark him now if we have not done so before , as the most dangerous negro of the future in this nation from the standpoint of communism , the negro , and national security .
soon after , the fbi was systematically bugging king's home and his hotel rooms , as they were now aware that king was growing in stature daily as the most prominent leader of the civil rights movement .
in the mid-1960s , king began to publicly criticize the bureau for giving insufficient attention to the use of terrorism by white supremacists .
hoover responded by publicly calling king the most " notorious liar " in the united states .
in his *num* memoir , " washington post " journalist carl rowan asserted that the fbi had sent at least one anonymous letter to king encouraging him to commit suicide .
historian taylor branch documents an anonymous november *num* , *num* " suicide package " sent by the fbi that contained audio recordings , which were obtained through tapping king's phone and placing bugs throughout various hotel rooms over the past two years was created two days after the announcement of king's impending nobel peace prize .
the tape , which was prepared by fbi audio technician john matter documented a series of king's sexual indiscretions combined with a letter telling him " there is only one way out for you .
you better take it before your filthy , abnormal , fraudulent self is bared to the nation " .
king was subsequently informed that the audio would be released to the media if he did not acquiesce and commit suicide prior to accepting his nobel peace award .
when king refused to satisfy their coercion tactics , fbi associate director , cartha d .
deloach , commenced a media campaign offering the surveillance transcript to various news organizations including " newsweek " and " newsday " .
and even by *num* , as has been noted elsewhere , " [ fbi ] efforts to ' expose ' martin luther king jr .
had not slackened even though king had been dead for a year .
[ the bureau ] furnished ammunition to conservatives to attack king's memory , and .
.
.
tried to block efforts to honor the slain leader .
" during the same period the program also targeted malcolm x .
while an fbi spokesman has denied that the fbi was " directly " involved in malcolm's murder in *num* , it is documented that the bureau worked to " widen the rift " between malcolm and elijah muhammad through infiltration and the " sparking of acrimonious debates within the organization , " rumor-mongering , and other tactics designed to foster internal disputes , which ultimately led to malcolm's assassination .
the fbi heavily infiltrated malcolm's organization of afro-american unity in the final months of his life .
the pulitzer prize-winning asserts that most of the men who plotted malcolm's assassination were never apprehended and that the full extent of the fbi's involvement in his death cannot be known .
amidst the urban unrest of july–august *num* , the fbi began " cointelpro–black hate " , which focused on king and the sclc as well as the student nonviolent coordinating committee ( sncc ) , the revolutionary action movement ( ram ) , the deacons for defense and justice , congress of racial equality ( core ) , and the nation of islam .
black hate established the ghetto informant program and instructed *num* fbi offices to " disrupt , misdirect , discredit , or otherwise neutralize the activities of black nationalist hate type organizations " .
a march *num* memo stated the program's goal was to " prevent the coalition of militant black nationalist groups " ; to " prevent the rise of a ' messiah ' who could unify .
.
.
the militant black nationalist movement " ; " to pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them before they exercise their potential for violence [ against authorities ] .
" ; to " prevent militant black nationalist groups and leaders from gaining respectability , by discrediting them to .
.
.
both the responsible community and to liberals who have vestiges of sympathy .
.
.
" ; and to " prevent the long-range growth of militant black organizations , especially among youth .
" dr .
king was said to have potential to be the " messiah " figure , should he abandon nonviolence and integrationism , and stokely carmichael was noted to have " the necessary charisma to be a real threat in this way " as he was portrayed as someone who espoused a much more militant vision of " black power .
" while the fbi was particularly concerned with leaders and organizers , they did not limit their scope of target to the heads of organizations .
individuals such as writers were also listed among the targets of operations .
this program coincided with a broader federal effort to prepare military responses for urban riots , and began increased collaboration between the fbi , central intelligence agency , national security agency , and the department of defense .
the cia launched its own domestic espionage project in *num* called operation chaos .
a particular target was the poor people's campaign , a national effort organized by king and the sclc to occupy washington , dc .
the fbi monitored and disrupted the campaign on a national level , while using targeted smear tactics locally to undermine support for the march .
the black panther party was another targeted organization , wherein the fbi collaborated to destroy the party from the inside out .
overall , cointelpro encompassed disruption and sabotage of the socialist workers party ( *num* ) , the ku klux klan ( *num* ) , the nation of islam , the black panther party ( *num* ) , and the entire new left social / political movement , which included antiwar , community , and religious groups ( *num* ) .
a later investigation by the senate's church committee ( see below ) stated that " cointelpro began in *num* , in part because of frustration with supreme court rulings limiting the government's power to proceed overtly against dissident groups .
" official congressional committees and several court cases have concluded that cointelpro operations against communist and socialist groups exceeded statutory limits on fbi activity and violated constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and association .
the program was secret until *num* , when the citizens ' commission to investigate the fbi burgled an fbi field office in media , pennsylvania , took several dossiers , and exposed the program by passing this material to news agencies .
the boxing match , known as the fight of the century , between muhammad ali and joe frazier in march *num* provided cover for the activist group to successfully pull off the burglary ; muhammad ali was himself a cointelpro target due to his involvement with the nation of islam and the anti-war movement .
many news organizations initially refused to publish the information .
within the year , director j .
edgar hoover declared that the centralized cointelpro was over , and that all future counterintelligence operations would be handled on a case-by-case basis .
additional documents were revealed in the course of separate lawsuits filed against the fbi by nbc correspondent carl stern , the socialist workers party , and a number of other groups .
in *num* the select committee to study governmental operations with respect to intelligence activities of the united states senate , commonly referred to as the " church committee " for its chairman , senator frank church of idaho , launched a major investigation of the fbi and cointelpro .
many released documents have been partly , or entirely , redacted .
the final report of the select committee castigated the conduct of the intelligence community in its domestic operations ( including cointelpro ) in no uncertain terms : the church committee documented a history of the fbi exercising political repression as far back as world war i , through the 1920s , when agents were charged with rounding up " anarchists , communists , socialists , reformists and revolutionaries " for deportation .
the domestic operations were increased against political and anti-war groups from *num* through *num* .
the intended effect of the fbi's cointelpro was to " expose , disrupt , misdirect , or otherwise neutralize " groups that the fbi officials believed were " subversive " by instructing fbi field operatives to : *num* .
create a negative public image for target groups by surveiling activists and then releasing negative personal information to the public .
*num* .
break down internal organization by creating conflicts by having agents exacerbate racial tensions , or send anonymous letters to try to create conflicts .
*num* .
create dissension between groups by spreading rumors that other groups were stealing money .
*num* .
restrict access to public resources by pressuring non-profit organizations to cut off funding or material support .
*num* .
restrict the ability to organize protest .
*num* .
restrict the ability of individuals to participate in group activities by character assassinations , false arrests , surveillance .
at its inception , the program's main target was the communist party .
in an interview with the bbc's andrew marr in february *num* , noam chomsky—a political activist and mit professor of linguistics—spoke about the purpose and the targets of cointelpro , saying : cointelpro was a program of subversion carried out not by a couple of petty crooks but by the national political police , the fbi , under four administrations .
.
.
by the time it got through , i won't run through the whole story , it was aimed at the entire new left , at the women's movement , at the whole black movement , it was extremely broad .
its actions went as far as political assassination .
according to the church committee : while the declared purposes of these programs were to protect the " national security " or prevent violence , bureau witnesses admit that many of the targets were nonviolent and most had no connections with a foreign power .
indeed , nonviolent organizations and individuals were targeted because the bureau believed they represented a " potential " for violence—and nonviolent citizens who were against the war in vietnam were targeted because they gave " aid and comfort " to violent demonstrators by lending respectability to their cause .
the imprecision of the targeting is demonstrated by the inability of the bureau to define the subjects of the programs .
the black nationalist program , according to its supervisor , included " a great number of organizations that you might not today characterize as black nationalist but which were in fact primarily black .
" thus , the nonviolent southern christian leadership conference was labeled as a black nationalist-"hate group .
" furthermore , the actual targets were chosen from a far broader group than the titles of the programs would imply .
the cpusa program targeted not only communist party members but also sponsors of the national committee to abolish the house un-american activities committee and civil rights leaders allegedly under communist influence or deemed to be not sufficiently " anti-communist " .
the socialist workers party program included non-swp sponsors of anti-war demonstrations which were cosponsored by the swp or the young socialist alliance , its youth group .
the black nationalist program targeted a range of organizations from the panthers to sncc to the peaceful southern christian leadership conference , and included every black student union and many other black student groups .
new left targets ranged from the sds to the interuniversity committee for debate on foreign policy , from antioch college ( " vanguard of the new left " ) to the new mexico free university and other " alternate " schools , and from underground newspapers to students ' protesting university censorship of a student publication by carrying signs with four-letter words on them .
examples of surveillance , spanning all presidents from fdr to nixon , both legal and illegal , contained in the church committee report : groups that were known to be targets of cointelpro operations include : the cointelpro operators targeted multiple groups at once , and encouraged splintering of these groups from within .
in letter writing campaigns ( wherein false letters were sent on behalf of members of parties ) , the fbi ensured that groups would not unite in their causes .
for instance they , launched a campaign specifically to alienate the black panther party from the mau maus , young lords , young patriots and sds .
these racially diverse groups had been building alliances , in part due to charismatic leaders such as fred hampton and his attempts to create a " rainbow coalition " .
the fbi was concerned with ensuring that groups could not gain traction through unity , specifically across racial lines .
one of the main ways of targeting these groups was to arouse suspicion between the different parties and causes .
in this way the bureau took on a divide and conquer offensive .
the cointelpro documents show numerous cases of the fbi's intentions to prevent and disrupt protests against the vietnam war .
many techniques were used to accomplish this task .
" these included promoting splits among antiwar forces , encouraging red-baiting of socialists , and pushing violent confrontations as an alternative to massive , peaceful demonstrations .
" one *num* cointelpro operation tried to redirect the socialist workers party from their pledge of support for the antiwar movement .
the fbi has said that it no longer undertakes cointelpro or cointelpro-like operations .
however , critics have claimed that agency programs in the spirit of cointelpro targeted groups such as the committee in solidarity with the people of el salvador , the american indian movement , earth first ! , and the anti-globalization movement .
according to attorney brian glick in his book " war at home " , the fbi used five main methods during cointelpro : the fbi specifically developed tactics intended to heighten tension and hostility between various factions in the black power movement , for example between the black panthers and the us organization .
for instance , the fbi sent a fake letter to the us organization exposing a supposed black panther plot to murder the head of the us organization , ron karenga .
they then intensified this by spreading falsely attributed cartoons in the black communities pitting the black panther party against the us organization .
this resulted in numerous deaths , among which were san diego black panther party members john huggins , bunchy carter and sylvester bell .
another example of the fbi's annonymous letter writing campaign is how they turned the blackstone rangers head , jeff fort , against former ally fred hampton , by stating that hampton had a hit on fort .
they also were instrumental in developing the rift between black panther party leaders eldridge cleaver and huey newton , as executed through false letters inciting the two leaders of the black panther party .
dhoruba bin wahad a former black panther , reflects on how these tactics made him feel , saying he had a combat mentality and felt like he was at war with the government .
when asked about why he thinks the black panthers were targeted he said , " in the united states , the equivalent of the military was the local police .
during the early sixties , at the height of the civil rights movement , and the human rights movement , the police in the united states became increasingly militaristic .
they began to train out of military bases in the united states .
the law enforcement assistance act supplied local police with military technology , everything from assault rifles to army personnel carriers .
in his opinion , the counterintelligence program went hand-in-hand with the militarization of the police in the black community , with the militarization of police in america .
" the fbi also conspired with the police departments of many u .
s .
cities ( san diego , los angeles , san francisco , oakland , philadelphia , chicago ) to encourage repeated raids on black panther homes—often with little or no evidence of violations of federal , state , or local laws—which resulted directly in the police killing many members of the black panther party , most notably chicago black panther party chairman fred hampton on december *num* , *num* .
before the death of hampton , long-term infiltrator , william o'neal , shared floor plans of his apartment with the cointelpro team .
he then gave hampton a dose of secobarbital that rendered hampton unconscious during the raid on his home .
in order to eliminate black militant leaders whom they considered dangerous , the fbi is believed to have worked with local police departments to target specific individuals , accuse them of crimes they did not commit , suppress exculpatory evidence and falsely incarcerate them .
elmer " geronimo " pratt , a black panther party leader , was incarcerated for *num* years before a california superior court vacated his murder conviction , ultimately freeing him .
appearing before the court , an fbi agent testified that he believed pratt had been framed , because both the fbi and the los angeles police department knew he had not been in the area at the time the murder occurred .
some sources claim that the fbi conducted more than *num* " black bag jobs " , which were warrantless surreptitious entries , against the targeted groups and their members .
in *num* the fbi special agent in san francisco wrote hoover that his investigation of the black panther party had concluded that in his city , at least , the panthers were primarily engaged in feeding breakfast to children .
hoover fired back a memo implying the agent's career goals would be directly affected by his supplying evidence to support hoover's view that the black panther party was " a violence-prone organization seeking to overthrow the government by revolutionary means " .
hoover supported using false claims to attack his political enemies .
in one memo he wrote : " purpose of counterintelligence action is to disrupt the black panther party and it is immaterial whether facts exist to substantiate the charge .
" in one particularly controversial *num* incident , white civil rights worker viola liuzzo was murdered by ku klux klansmen , who gave chase and fired shots into her car after noticing that her passenger was a young black man ; one of the klansmen was gary thomas rowe , an acknowledged fbi informant .
the fbi spread rumors that liuzzo was a member of the communist party and had abandoned her children to have sexual relationships with african americans involved in the civil rights movement .
fbi records show that j .
edgar hoover personally communicated these insinuations to president johnson .
fbi informant rowe has also been implicated in some of the most violent crimes of the 1960s civil rights era , including attacks on the freedom riders and the *num* birmingham , alabama *ord* street baptist church bombing .
according to noam chomsky , in another instance in san diego , the fbi financed , armed , and controlled an extreme right-wing group of former minutemen , transforming it into a group called the secret army organization that targeted groups , activists , and leaders involved in the anti-war movement , using both intimidation and violent acts .
hoover ordered preemptive action " to pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them before they exercise their potential for violence .
" the final report of the church committee concluded : too many people have been spied upon by too many government agencies and too much information has been illegally collected .
the government has often undertaken the secret surveillance of citizens on the basis of their political beliefs , even when those beliefs posed no threat of violence or illegal acts on behalf of a hostile foreign power .
the government , operating primarily through secret and biased informants , but also using other intrusive techniques such as wiretaps , microphone " bugs " , surreptitious mail opening , and break-ins , has swept in vast amounts of information about the personal lives , views , and associations of american citizens .
investigations of groups deemed potentially dangerous—and even of groups suspected of associating with potentially dangerous organizations—have continued for decades , despite the fact that those groups did not engage in unlawful activity .
groups and individuals have been assaulted , repressed , harassed and disrupted because of their political views , social beliefs and their lifestyles .
investigations have been based upon vague standards whose breadth made excessive collection inevitable .
unsavory , harmful and vicious tactics have been employed—including anonymous attempts to break up marriages , disrupt meetings , ostracize persons from their professions , and provoke target groups into rivalries that might result in deaths .
intelligence agencies have served the political and personal objectives of presidents and other high officials .
while the agencies often committed excesses in response to pressure from high officials in the executive branch and congress , they also occasionally initiated improper activities and then concealed them from officials whom they had a duty to inform .
governmental officials—including those whose principal duty is to enforce the law—have violated or ignored the law over long periods of time and have advocated and defended their right to break the law .
the constitutional system of checks and balances has not adequately controlled intelligence activities .
until recently the executive branch has neither delineated the scope of permissible activities nor established procedures for supervising intelligence agencies .
congress has failed to exercise sufficient oversight , seldom questioning the use to which its appropriations were being put .
most domestic intelligence issues have not reached the courts , and in those cases when they have reached the courts , the judiciary has been reluctant to grapple with them .
while cointelpro was officially terminated in april *num* , domestic espionage continued .
between *num* and *num* , it is documented that the bureau planted over *num* bugs without a warrant and opened over *num* , *num* pieces of personal mail .
more recent targets of covert action include the american indian movement ( aim ) , earth first ! , and committees in solidarity with the people of el salvador .
documents released under the foia show that the fbi tracked the late david halberstam—a pulitzer prize-winning journalist and author—for more than two decades .
" counterterrorism " guidelines implemented during the reagan administration have been described as allowing a return to cointelpro tactics .
some radical groups accuse factional opponents of being fbi informants or assume the fbi is infiltrating the movement .
cointelpro survivor filiberto ojeda rios was killed by the fbi's hostage rescue team in *num* , his death described as an assassination by a united nations special committee .
some authors , lawyers and academics have argued that the outlawed cointelpro program was reinstated in *num* and still exists today under the u .
s .
department of justice community oriented policing program ( " cops " ) written and enacted in the violent crime control and law enforcement act of *num* by then president bill clinton and then senator joseph biden .
the surreptitious reincarnation of cointelpro with the cops gang-stalking program environmentalist eric mcdavid convicted on arson charges was released after documents emerged demonstrating that the fbi informant in his earth liberation front group provided crucial leadership , information , and material without which the crime could not have been committed , repeating the same pattern of behaviour of cointelpro .
it has been claimed these sorts of practices have become widespread in fbi counter-terrorism cases targeting leftwing politics and muslims in the *num* bronx terrorism plot and others .
authors such as ward churchill , rex weyler , and peter matthiessen allege that the federal government intended to acquire uranium deposits on the lakota tribe's reservation land , and that this motivated a larger government conspiracy against aim activists on the pine ridge reservation .
others believe cointelpro continues and similar actions are being taken against activist groups .
caroline woidat says that , with respect to native americans , cointelpro should be understood within a historical context in which " native americans have been viewed and have viewed the world themselves through the lens of conspiracy theory .
" other authors argue that while some conspiracy theories related to cointelpro are unfounded , the issue of ongoing government surveillance and repression is real .
fbi agent richard g .
held is known to have increased fbi support for the guardians of the oglala nation ( goon ) squads accused of the assault and murder of hundreds of aim supporters .
the bureau refused to investigate the *num* cases of homicide directly linked to goon , but committed its resources overwhelmingly to prosecute aim .
in april *num* , the " atlanta black star " characterized the fbi as still engaging in cointelpro behavior by surveilling the black lives matter movement .
in *num* , the fbi tracked an activist of the movement using tactics which " the intercept " found " reminiscent of a rich american history of targeting black americans , " including " fbi's notorious cointelpro program , " which " was aimed at disrupting and infiltrating civil rights and black nationalist movements from *num* to *num* .
" this practice , along with the imprisonment of black activists for their views , has been associated with the new fbi designation of " black identity extremists .

cinema of japan the has a history that spans more than *num* years .

in *num* japan produced *num* feature films that earned *num* .
*num* % of a box office total of us$2 .
*num* billion .
movies have been produced in japan since *num* , when the first foreign cameramen arrived .
in a " sight & sound " list of the best films produced in asia , japanese works made up eight of the top *num* , with " tokyo story " ( *num* ) ranked number one .
japan has won the academy award for the best foreign language film four times , more than any other asian country .
the kinetoscope , first shown commercially by thomas edison in the united states in *num* , was first shown in japan in november *num* .
the vitascope and the lumière brothers ' cinematograph were first presented in japan in early *num* , by businessmen such as inabata katsutaro .
lumière cameramen were the first to shoot films in japan .
moving pictures , however , were not an entirely new experience for the japanese because of their rich tradition of pre-cinematic devices such as " gentō " ( " utsushi-e " ) or the magic lantern .
the first successful japanese film in late *num* showed sights in tokyo .
in *num* some ghost films were made , the shirō asano shorts " bake jizo " ( jizo the spook / 化け地蔵 ) and " shinin no sosei " ( resurrection of a corpse ) .
the first documentary , the short " geisha no teodori " ( 芸者の手踊り ) , was made in june *num* .
tsunekichi shibata made a number of early films , including " momijigari " , an *num* record of two famous actors performing a scene from a well-known kabuki play .
early films were influenced by traditional theater – for example , kabuki and bunraku .
at the dawn of the twentieth century theaters in japan hired benshi , storytellers who sat next to the screen and narrated silent movies .
they were descendants of kabuki jōruri , kōdan storytellers , theater barkers and other forms of oral storytelling .
benshi could be accompanied by music like silent films from cinema of the west .
with the advent of sound in the early 1930s , the benshi gradually declined .
in *num* , shōzō makino , considered the pioneering director of japanese film , began his influential career with " honnōji gassen " ( 本能寺合戦 ) , produced for yokota shōkai .
shōzō recruited matsunosuke onoe , a former kabuki actor , to star in his productions .
onoe became japan's first film star , appearing in over *num* , *num* films , mostly shorts , between *num* and *num* .
the pair pioneered the " jidaigeki " genre .
tokihiko okada was a popular romantic lead of the same era .
the first japanese film production studio was built in *num* by the yoshizawa shōten company in tokyo .
the first female japanese performer to appear in a film professionally was the dancer / actress tokuko nagai takagi , who appeared in four shorts for the american-based thanhouser company between *num* and *num* .
among intellectuals , critiques of japanese cinema grew in the 1910s and eventually developed into a movement that transformed japanese film .
film criticism began with early film magazines such as " katsudō shashinkai " ( begun in *num* ) and a full-length book written by yasunosuke gonda in *num* , but many early film critics often focused on chastising the work of studios like nikkatsu and tenkatsu for being too theatrical ( using , for instance , elements from kabuki and shinpa such as onnagata ) and for not utilizing what were considered more cinematic techniques to tell stories , instead relying on benshi .
in what was later named the pure film movement , writers in magazines such as " kinema record " called for a broader use of such cinematic techniques .
some of these critics , such as norimasa kaeriyama , went on to put their ideas into practice by directing such films as " the glow of life " ( *num* ) , which was one of the first films to use actresses ( in this case , harumi hanayagi ) .
there were parallel efforts elsewhere in the film industry .
in his *num* film " the captain's daughter " , masao inoue started using techniques new to the silent film era , such as the close-up and cut back .
the pure film movement was central in the development of the gendaigeki and scriptwriting .
new studios established around *num* , such as shochiku and taikatsu , aided the cause for reform .
at taikatsu , thomas kurihara directed films scripted by the novelist junichiro tanizaki , who was a strong advocate of film reform .
even nikkatsu produced reformist films under the direction of eizō tanaka .
by the mid-1920s , actresses had replaced onnagata and films used more of the devices pioneered by inoue .
some of the most discussed silent films from japan are those of kenji mizoguchi , whose later works ( e .
g .
, " the life of oharu " ) are still highly regarded .
japanese films gained popularity in the mid-1920s against foreign films , in part fueled by the popularity of movie stars and a new style of jidaigeki .
directors such as daisuke itō and masahiro makino made samurai films like " a diary of chuji's travels " and " roningai " featuring rebellious antiheroes in fast-cut fight scenes that were both critically acclaimed and commercial successes .
some stars , such as tsumasaburo bando , kanjūrō arashi , chiezō kataoka , takako irie and utaemon ichikawa , were inspired by makino film productions and formed their own independent production companies where directors such as hiroshi inagaki , mansaku itami and sadao yamanaka honed their skills .
director teinosuke kinugasa created a production company to produce the experimental masterpiece " a page of madness " , starring masao inoue , in *num* .
many of these companies , while surviving during the silent era against major studios like nikkatsu , shochiku , teikine , and toa studios , could not survive the cost involved in converting to sound .
with the rise of left-wing political movements and labor unions at the end of the 1920s arose so-called tendency films with left-wing " tendencies " , with prominent examples being directed by kenji mizoguchi , daisuke itō , shigeyoshi suzuki , and tomu uchida .
in contrast with these commercially produced *num* mm films , the marxist proletarian film league of japan ( prokino ) made works independently in smaller gauges ( such as *num* .
5mm and 16mm ) , with more radical intentions .
tendency films suffered from severe censorship heading into the 1930s , and prokino members were arrested and the movement effectively crushed .
such moves by the government had profound effects on the expression of political dissent in 1930s cinema .
films from this period include : " sakanaya honda , jitsuroku chushingura , horaijima , orochi , maboroshi , kurutta ippeji , jujiro , " , and " kurama tengu " .
a later version of " the captain's daughter " was one of the first talkie films .
it used the mina talkie system .
the japanese film industry later split into two groups ; one retained the mina talkie system , while the other used the iisutofyon talkie system used to make tojo masaki's films .
the *num* earthquake , the bombing of tokyo during world war ii , and the natural effects of time and japan's humidity on inflammable and unstable nitrate film have resulted in a great dearth of surviving films from this period .
unlike in the west , silent films were still being produced in japan well into the 1930s .
for instance , yasujirō ozu's " an inn in tokyo " ( *num* ) , considered a precursor to the neorealism genre , was a silent film .
a few japanese sound shorts were made in the 1920s and 1930s , but japan's first feature-length talkie was " fujiwara yoshie no furusato " ( *num* ) , which used the " mina talkie system " .
notable talkies of this period include mikio naruse's " wife , be like a rose ! " ( " tsuma yo bara no yoni " , *num* ) , which was one of the first japanese films to gain a theatrical release in the u .
s .
; kenji mizoguchi's " sisters of the gion " ( " gion no shimai " , *num* ) ; " osaka elegy " ( *num* ) ; and " the story of the last chrysanthemums " ( *num* ) ; and sadao yamanaka's " humanity and paper balloons " ( *num* ) .
film criticism shared this vitality , with many film journals such as " kinema junpo " and newspapers printing detailed discussions of the cinema of the day , both at home and abroad .
a cultured " impressionist " criticism pursued by critics such as tadashi iijima , fuyuhiko kitagawa , and matsuo kishi was dominant , but opposed by leftist critics such as akira iwasaki and genjū sasa who sought an ideological critique of films .
the 1930s also saw increased government involvement in cinema , which was symbolized by the passing of the film law , which gave the state more authority over the film industry , in *num* .
the government encouraged some forms of cinema , producing propaganda films and promoting documentary films ( also called " bunka eiga " or " culture films " ) , with important documentaries being made by directors such as fumio kamei .
realism was in favor ; film theorists such as taihei imamura and heiichi sugiyama advocated for documentary or realist drama , while directors such as hiroshi shimizu and tomotaka tasaka produced fiction films that were strongly realistic in style .
because of world war ii and the weak economy , unemployment became widespread in japan , and the cinema industry suffered .
during this period , when japan was expanding its empire , the japanese government saw cinema as a propaganda tool to show the glory and invincibility of the empire of japan .
thus , many films from this period depict patriotic and militaristic themes .
in *num* kajiro yamamoto's film " hawai mare oki kaisen " or " the war at sea from hawaii to malaya " portrayed the attack on pearl harbor ; the film made use of special effects directed by eiji tsuburaya , including a miniature scale model of pearl harbor itself .
akira kurosawa made his feature film debut with " sugata sanshiro " in *num* .
the first collaborations between kurosawa and actor toshiro mifune were " drunken angel " in *num* and " stray dog " in *num* .
yasujirō ozu directed the critically and commercially successful " late spring " in *num* .
the mainichi film award was created in *num* .
with the scap occupation following the end of world war ii , japan was exposed to over a decade's worth of american animation that had been banned under the war-time government .
the 1950s are widely considered the golden age of japanese cinema .
three japanese films from this decade ( " rashomon " , " seven samurai " and " tokyo story " ) appeared in the top ten of " sight & sound"s critics ' and directors ' polls for the best films of all time in *num* .
they also appeared in the *num* polls , with " tokyo story " ( *num* ) dethroning " citizen kane " at the top of the *num* directors ' poll .
the period after the american occupation led to a rise in diversity in movie distribution thanks to the increased output and popularity of the film studios of toho , daiei , shochiku , nikkatsu , and toei .
this period gave rise to the four great artists of japanese cinema : masaki kobayashi , akira kurosawa , kenji mizoguchi , and yasujirō ozu .
each director dealt with the effects the war and subsequent occupation by america in unique and innovative ways .
the decade started with akira kurosawa's " rashomon " ( *num* ) , which won the golden lion at the venice film festival in *num* and the academy honorary award for best foreign language film in *num* , and marked the entrance of japanese cinema onto the world stage .
it was also the breakout role for legendary star toshiro mifune .
in *num* " entotsu no mieru basho " by heinosuke gosho was in competition at the *ord* berlin international film festival .
the first japanese film in color was " carmen comes home " directed by keisuke kinoshita and released in *num* .
there was also a black-and-white version of this film available .
" tokyo file *num* " ( *num* ) was the first american feature film to be shot entirely in japan .
the lead roles were played by florence marly and robert peyton .
it featured the geisha ichimaru in a short cameo .
suzuki ikuzo's tonichi enterprises company co-produced the film .
" gate of hell " , a *num* film by teinosuke kinugasa , was the first movie that filmed using eastmancolor film , " gate of hell " was both daiei's first color film and the first japanese color movie to be released outside japan , receiving an academy honorary award in *num* for best costume design by sanzo wada and an honorary award for best foreign language film .
it also won the palme d'or at the cannes film festival , the first japanese film to achieve that honour .
the year *num* saw two of japan's most influential films released .
the first was the kurosawa epic " seven samurai " , about a band of hired samurai who protect a helpless village from a rapacious gang of thieves .
the same year , ishirō honda directed the anti-nuclear monster-drama " godzilla " , which was released in america as " godzilla , king of the monsters " .
though edited for its western release , godzilla became an international icon of japan and spawned an entire subgenre of " kaiju " films , as well as the longest-running film franchise in history .
also in *num* , another kurosawa film , " ikiru " was in competition at the *ord* berlin international film festival .
in *num* , hiroshi inagaki won an academy honorary award for best foreign language film for of his " samurai " trilogy and in *num* won the golden lion at the venice film festival for " rickshaw man " .
kon ichikawa directed two anti-war dramas : " the burmese harp " ( *num* ) , which was nominated for best foreign language film at the academy awards , and " fires on the plain " ( *num* ) , along with " enjo " ( *num* ) , which was adapted from yukio mishima's novel " temple of the golden pavilion " .
masaki kobayashi made three films which would collectively become known as " the human condition trilogy " : " no greater love " ( *num* ) , and " the road to eternity " ( *num* ) .
the trilogy was completed in *num* , with " a soldier's prayer " .
kenji mizoguchi , who died in *num* , ended his career with a series of masterpieces including " the life of oharu " ( *num* ) , " ugetsu " ( *num* ) and " sansho the bailiff " ( *num* ) .
he won the silver bear at the venice film festival for " ugetsu " .
mizoguchi's films often deal with the tragedies inflicted on women by japanese society .
mikio naruse made " repast " ( *num* ) , " late chrysanthemums " ( *num* ) , " the sound of the mountain " ( *num* ) and " floating clouds " ( *num* ) .
yasujirō ozu began directing color films beginning with " equinox flower " ( *num* ) , and later " good morning " ( *num* ) and " floating weeds " ( *num* ) , which was adapted from his earlier silent " a story of floating weeds " ( *num* ) , and was shot by " rashomon " and " sansho the bailiff " cinematographer kazuo miyagawa .
the blue ribbon awards were established in *num* .
the first winner for best film was " until we meet again " by tadashi imai .
the number of films produced , and the cinema audience reached a peak in the 1960s .
most films were shown in double bills , with one half of the bill being a " program picture " or b-movie .
a typical program picture was shot in four weeks .
the demand for these program pictures in quantity meant the growth of film series such as " the hoodlum soldier " or " akumyo " .
the huge level of activity of 1960s japanese cinema also resulted in many classics .
akira kurosawa directed the *num* classic " yojimbo " .
yasujirō ozu made his final film , " an autumn afternoon " , in *num* .
mikio naruse directed the wide screen melodrama " when a woman ascends the stairs " in *num* ; his final film was 1967's " scattered clouds " .
kon ichikawa captured the watershed *num* olympics in his three-hour documentary " tokyo olympiad " ( *num* ) .
seijun suzuki was fired by nikkatsu for " making films that don't make any sense and don't make any money " after his surrealist yakuza flick " branded to kill " ( *num* ) .
the 1960s were the peak years of the " japanese new wave " movement , which began in the 1950s and continued through the early 1970s .
nagisa oshima , kaneto shindo , masahiro shinoda , susumu hani and shohei imamura emerged as major filmmakers during the decade .
oshima's " cruel story of youth " , " night and fog in japan " and " death by hanging " , along with shindo's " onibaba " , hani's " kanojo to kare " and imamura's " the insect woman " , became some of the better-known examples of japanese new wave filmmaking .
documentary played a crucial role in the new wave , as directors such as hani , kazuo kuroki , toshio matsumoto , and hiroshi teshigahara moved from documentary into fiction film , while feature filmmakers like oshima and imamura also made documentaries .
shinsuke ogawa and noriaki tsuchimoto became the most important documentarists : " two figures [ that ] tower over the landscape of japanese documentary .
" teshigahara's " woman in the dunes " ( *num* ) won the special jury prize at the cannes film festival , and was nominated for best director and best foreign language film oscars .
masaki kobayashi's " kwaidan " ( *num* ) also picked up the special jury prize at cannes and received a nomination for best foreign language film at the academy awards .
" bushido , samurai saga " by tadashi imai won the golden bear at the *ord* berlin international film festival .
" immortal love " by keisuke kinoshita and " twin sisters of kyoto " and " portrait of chieko " , both by noboru nakamura , also received nominations for best foreign language film at the academy awards .
" lost spring " , also by nakamura , was in competition for the golden bear at the *ord* berlin international film festival .
the 1970s saw the cinema audience drop due to the spread of television .
total audience declined from *num* .
*num* billion in *num* to *num* .
*num* billion in *num* .
film companies fought back in various ways , such as the bigger budget films of kadokawa pictures , or including increasingly sexual or violent content and language which could not be shown on television .
the resulting pink film industry became the stepping stone for many young independent filmmakers .
the seventies also saw the start of the " idol eiga " , films starring young " idols " , who would bring in audiences due to their fame and popularity .
toshiya fujita made the revenge film " lady snowblood " in *num* .
in the same year , yoshishige yoshida made the film " coup d'état " , a portrait of ikki kita , the leader of the japanese coup of february *num* .
its experimental cinematography and mise-en-scène , as well as its avant-garde score by ichiyanagi sei , garnered it wide critical acclaim within japan .

"dodes'ka-den " by akira kurosawa and " sandakan no .
*num* " by kei kumai were nominated to the academy award for best foreign language film .
the 1980s saw the decline of the major japanese film studios and their associated chains of cinemas , with major studios toho and toei barely staying in business , shochiku supported almost solely by the " otoko wa tsurai " films , and nikkatsu declining even further .

graphite graphite ( ) , archaically referred to as plumbago , is a crystalline form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a hexagonal structure .
it occurs naturally in this form and is the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions .
under high pressures and temperatures it converts to diamond .
graphite is used in pencils and lubricants .
its high conductivity makes it useful in electronic products such as electrodes , batteries , and solar panels .
the principal types of natural graphite , each occurring in different types of ore deposits , are graphite occurs in metamorphic rocks as a result of the reduction of sedimentary carbon compounds during metamorphism .
it also occurs in igneous rocks and in meteorites .
minerals associated with graphite include quartz , calcite , micas and tourmaline .
the principal export sources of mined graphite are in order of tonnage : china , mexico , canada , brazil , and madagascar .
in meteorites , graphite occurs with troilite and silicate minerals .
small graphitic crystals in meteoritic iron are called cliftonite .
some microscopic grains have distinctive isotopic compositions , indicating that they were formed before the solar system .
they are one of about *num* known types of mineral that predate the solar system and have also been detected in molecular clouds .
these minerals were formed in the ejecta when supernovae exploded or low- to intermediate-sized stars expelled their outer envelopes late in their lives .
graphite may be the second or third oldest mineral in the universe .
graphite is one of the allotropes of carbon along with diamond and buckminsterfullerene .
graphite has a layered , planar structure .
the individual layers are called graphene .
in each layer , the carbon atoms are arranged in a honeycomb lattice with separation of *num* .
*num* nm , and the distance between planes is *num* .
*num* nm .
atoms in the plane are bonded covalently , with only three of the four potential bonding sites satisfied .
the fourth electron is free to migrate in the plane , making graphite electrically conductive .
however , it does not conduct in a direction at right angles to the plane .
bonding between layers is via weak van der waals bonds , which allows layers of graphite to be easily separated , or to slide past each other .
the two known forms of graphite , " alpha " ( hexagonal ) and " beta " ( rhombohedral ) , have very similar physical properties , except that the graphene layers stack slightly differently .
the alpha graphite may be either flat or buckled .
the alpha form can be converted to the beta form through mechanical treatment and the beta form reverts to the alpha form when it is heated above *num* °c .
the equilibrium pressure and temperature conditions for a transition between graphite and diamond is well established theoretically and experimentally .
the pressure changes linearly between at and at ( the diamond / graphite / liquid triple point ) .
however , the phases have a wide region about this line where they can coexist .
at normal temperature and pressure , and , the stable phase of carbon is graphite , but diamond is metastable and its rate of conversion to graphite is negligible .
however , at temperatures above about , diamond rapidly converts to graphite .
rapid conversion of graphite to diamond requires pressures well above the equilibrium line : at , a pressure of is needed .
the acoustic and thermal properties of graphite are highly anisotropic , since phonons propagate quickly along the tightly bound planes , but are slower to travel from one plane to another .
graphite's high thermal stability and electrical and thermal conductivity facilitate its widespread use as electrodes and refractories in high temperature material processing applications .
however , in oxygen-containing atmospheres graphite readily oxidizes to form carbon dioxide at temperatures of *num* °c and above .
graphite is an electrical conductor , hence useful in such applications as arc lamp electrodes .
it can conduct electricity due to the vast electron delocalization within the carbon layers ( a phenomenon called aromaticity ) .
these valence electrons are free to move , so are able to conduct electricity .
however , the electricity is primarily conducted within the plane of the layers .
the conductive properties of powdered graphite allow its use as pressure sensor in carbon microphones .
graphite and graphite powder are valued in industrial applications for their self-lubricating and dry lubricating properties .
there is a common belief that graphite's lubricating properties are solely due to the loose interlamellar coupling between sheets in the structure .
however , it has been shown that in a vacuum environment ( such as in technologies for use in space ) , graphite degrades as a lubricant , due to the hypoxic conditions .
this observation led to the hypothesis that the lubrication is due to the presence of fluids between the layers , such as air and water , which are naturally adsorbed from the environment .
this hypothesis has been refuted by studies showing that air and water are not absorbed .
recent studies suggest that an effect called superlubricity can also account for graphite's lubricating properties .
the use of graphite is limited by its tendency to facilitate pitting corrosion in some stainless steel , and to promote galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals ( due to its electrical conductivity ) .
it is also corrosive to aluminium in the presence of moisture .
for this reason , the us air force banned its use as a lubricant in aluminium aircraft , and discouraged its use in aluminium-containing automatic weapons .
even graphite pencil marks on aluminium parts may facilitate corrosion .
another high-temperature lubricant , hexagonal boron nitride , has the same molecular structure as graphite .
it is sometimes called " white graphite " , due to its similar properties .
when a large number of crystallographic defects bind these planes together , graphite loses its lubrication properties and becomes what is known as pyrolytic graphite .
it is also highly anisotropic , and diamagnetic , thus it will float in mid-air above a strong magnet .
if it is made in a fluidized bed at 1000–1300 °c then it is isotropic turbostratic , and is used in blood contacting devices like mechanical heart valves and is called pyrolytic carbon , and is not diamagnetic .
pyrolytic graphite and pyrolytic carbon are often confused but are very different materials .
natural and crystalline graphites are not often used in pure form as structural materials , due to their shear-planes , brittleness , and inconsistent mechanical properties .
in the *ord* millennium bc , during the neolithic age in southeastern europe , the marița culture used graphite in a ceramic paint for decorating pottery .
some time before *num* ( some sources say as early as *num* ) , an enormous deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to grey knotts from the hamlet of seathwaite in borrowdale parish , cumbria , england , which the locals found useful for marking sheep .
during the reign of elizabeth i ( 1558–1603 ) , borrowdale graphite was used as a refractory material to line moulds for cannonballs , resulting in rounder , smoother balls that could be fired farther , contributing to the strength of the english navy .
this particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and soft , and could easily be cut into sticks .
because of its military importance , this unique mine and its production were strictly controlled by the crown .
during the *ord* century , graphite's uses greatly expanded to include stove polish , lubricants , paints , crucibles , foundry facings , and pencils , a major factor in the expansion of educational tools during the first great rise of education for the masses .
the british empire controlled most of the world's production ( especially from ceylon ) , but production from austrian , german and american deposits expanded by mid-century .
for example , the dixon crucible company of jersey city , new jersey , founded by joseph dixon ( inventor ) and partner orestes cleveland in *num* , opened mines in the lake ticonderoga district of new york , built a processing plant there , and a factory to manufacture pencils , crucibles and other products in new jersey , described in the " engineering & mining journal " *num* december *num* .
the dixon pencil is still in production .
the beginnings of the revolutionary froth flotation process are associated with graphite mining .
included in the " e&mj " article on the dixon crucible company is a sketch of the " floating tanks " used in the age-old process of extracting graphite .
because graphite is so light , the mix of graphite and waste was sent through a final series of water tanks where a cleaner graphite “floated” off , which left waste to drop out .
in an *num* patent , the two brothers bessel ( adolph and august ) of dresden , germany , took this " floating " process a step further and added a small amount of oil to the tanks and boiled the mix – an agitation or frothing step – to collect the graphite , the first steps toward the future flotation process .
adolph bessel received the wohler medal for the patented process that upgraded the recovery of graphite to *num* % from the german deposit .
in *num* , the german society of mining engineers and metallurgists organized a special symposium dedicated to their discovery and , thus , the *ord* anniversary of flotation .
in the united states , in *num* , hezekiah bradford of philadelphia patented a similar process , but it is uncertain if his process was used successfully in the nearby graphite deposits of chester county , pennsylvania , a major producer by the 1890s .
the bessel process was limited in use , primarily because of the abundant cleaner deposits found around the globe , which needed not much more than hand-sorting to gather the pure graphite .
the state of the art , ca .
*num* , is described in the canadian department of mines report on graphite mines and mining , when canadian deposits began to become important producers of graphite .
historically , graphite was called black lead or plumbago .
plumbago was commonly used in its massive mineral form .
both of these names arise from confusion with the similar-appearing lead ores , particularly galena .
the latin word for lead , " plumbum " , gave its name to the english term for this grey metallic-sheened mineral and even to the leadworts or plumbagos , plants with flowers that resemble this colour .
the term " black lead " usually refers to a powdered or processed graphite , matte black in color .
abraham gottlob werner coined the name " graphite " ( " writing stone " ) in *num* .
he attempted to clear up the confusion between molybdena , plumbago and black lead after carl wilhelm scheele in *num* proved that there are at least three different minerals .
scheele's analysis showed that the chemical compounds molybdenum sulfide ( molybdenite ) , lead ( ii ) sulfide ( galena ) and graphite were three different soft black minerals .
natural graphite is mostly used for refractories , batteries , steelmaking , expanded graphite , brake linings , foundry facings and lubricants .
the use of graphite as a refractory material began before *num* with the graphite crucible used to hold molten metal ; this is now a minor part of refractories .
in the mid-1980s , the carbon-magnesite brick became important , and a bit later the alumina-graphite shape .
the order of importance is : alumina-graphite shapes , carbon-magnesite brick , monolithics ( gunning and ramming mixes ) , and then crucibles .
crucibles began using very large flake graphite , and carbon-magnesite brick requiring not quite so large flake graphite ; for these and others there is now much more flexibility in the size of flake required , and amorphous graphite is no longer restricted to low-end refractories .
alumina-graphite shapes are used as continuous casting ware , such as nozzles and troughs , to convey the molten steel from ladle to mold , and carbon magnesite bricks line steel converters and electric-arc furnaces to withstand extreme temperatures .
graphite blocks are also used in parts of blast furnace linings where the high thermal conductivity of the graphite is critical .
high-purity monolithics are often used as a continuous furnace lining instead of carbon-magnesite bricks .
the us and european refractories industry had a crisis in 2000–2003 , with an indifferent market for steel and a declining refractory consumption per tonne of steel underlying firm buyouts and many plant closures .
many of the plant closures resulted from the acquisition of harbison-walker refractories by rhi ag and some plants had their equipment auctioned off .
since much of the lost capacity was for carbon-magnesite brick , graphite consumption within the refractories area moved towards alumina-graphite shapes and monolithics , and away from brick .
the major source of carbon-magnesite brick is now imports from china .
almost all of the above refractories are used to make steel and account for *num* % of refractory consumption ; the rest is used by a variety of industries , such as cement .
according to the usgs , us natural graphite consumption in refractories comprised *num* , *num* tonnes in *num* .
the use of graphite in batteries has increased in the last *num* years .
natural and synthetic graphite are used to construct electrodes in major battery technologies .
the lithium-ion battery utilizes roughly twice the amount of graphite as lithium carbonate .
the demand for batteries , primarily nickel–metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries , caused a growth in demand for graphite in the late 1980s and early 1990s – a growth driven by portable electronics , such as portable cd players and power tools .
laptops , mobile phones , tablets , and smartphone products have increased the demand for batteries .
electric-vehicle batteries are anticipated to increase graphite demand .
as an example , a lithium-ion battery in a fully electric nissan leaf contains nearly *num* kg of graphite .
natural graphite in steelmaking mostly goes into raising the carbon content in molten steel , and can also be used to lubricate the dies used to extrude hot steel .
carbon additives are subject to competitive pricing from alternatives such as synthetic graphite powder , petroleum coke , and other forms of carbon .
a carbon raiser is added to increase the carbon content of the steel to the specified level .
an estimate based on usgs's graphite consumption statistics indicates that *num* , *num* tonnes were used in this fashion in the us in *num* .
natural amorphous and fine flake graphite are used in brake linings or brake shoes for heavier ( nonautomotive ) vehicles , and became important with the need to substitute for asbestos .
this use has been important for quite some time , but nonasbestos organic ( nao ) compositions are beginning to reduce graphite's market share .
a brake-lining industry shake-out with some plant closures has not been beneficial , nor has an indifferent automotive market .
according to the usgs , us natural graphite consumption in brake linings was *num* , *num* tonnes in *num* .
a foundry facing mold wash is a water-based paint of amorphous or fine flake graphite .
painting the inside of a mold with it and letting it dry leaves a fine graphite coat that will ease separation of the object cast after the hot metal has cooled .
graphite lubricants are specialty items for use at very high or very low temperatures , as forging die lubricant , an antiseize agent , a gear lubricant for mining machinery , and to lubricate locks .
having low-grit graphite , or even better , no-grit graphite ( ultra high purity ) , is highly desirable .
it can be used as a dry powder , in water or oil , or as colloidal graphite ( a permanent suspension in a liquid ) .
an estimate based on usgs graphite consumption statistics indicates that *num* , *num* tonnes was used in this fashion in *num* .
the ability to leave marks on paper and other objects gave graphite its name , given in *num* by german mineralogist abraham gottlob werner .
it stems from " graphein " , meaning " to write " or " draw " in ancient greek .
from the *ord* century , all pencils were made with leads of english natural graphite , but modern pencil lead is most commonly a mix of powdered graphite and clay ; it was invented by nicolas-jacques conté in *num* .
it is chemically unrelated to the metal lead , whose ores had a similar appearance , hence the continuation of the name .
plumbago is another older term for natural graphite used for drawing , typically as a lump of the mineral without a wood casing .
the term plumbago drawing is normally restricted to *ord* and *ord* century works , mostly portraits .
today , pencils are still a small but significant market for natural graphite .
around *num* % of the *num* .
*num* million tonnes produced in *num* was used to make pencils .
low-quality amorphous graphite is used and sourced mainly from china .
natural graphite has found uses in zinc-carbon batteries , in electric motor brushes , and various specialized applications .
graphite of various hardness or softness results in different qualities and tones when used as an artistic medium .
railroads would often mix powdered graphite with waste oil or linseed oil to create a heat-resistant protective coating for the exposed portions of a steam locomotive's boiler , such as the smokebox or lower part of the firebox .
expanded graphite is made by immersing natural flake graphite in a bath of chromic acid , then concentrated sulfuric acid , which forces the crystal lattice planes apart , thus expanding the graphite .
the expanded graphite can be used to make graphite foil or used directly as " hot top " compound to insulate molten metal in a ladle or red-hot steel ingots and decrease heat loss , or as firestops fitted around a fire door or in sheet metal collars surrounding plastic pipe ( during a fire , the graphite expands and chars to resist fire penetration and spread ) , or to make high-performance gasket material for high-temperature use .
after being made into graphite foil , the foil is machined and assembled into the bipolar plates in fuel cells .
the foil is made into heat sinks for laptop computers which keeps them cool while saving weight , and is made into a foil laminate that can be used in valve packings or made into gaskets .
old-style packings are now a minor member of this grouping : fine flake graphite in oils or greases for uses requiring heat resistance .
a gan estimate of current us natural graphite consumption in this end use is *num* , *num* tonnes .
graphite forms intercalation compounds with some metals and small molecules .
in these compounds , the host molecule or atom gets " sandwiched " between the graphite layers , resulting in a type of compound with variable stoichiometry .
a prominent example of an intercalation compound is potassium graphite , denoted by the formula kc .
some graphite intercalation compounds are superconductors .
the highest transition temperature ( by june *num* ) " t " = *num* .
*num* k is achieved in cac , and it further increases under applied pressure ( *num* .
*num* k at *num* gpa ) .
graphite's ability to intercalate lithium ions without significant damage from swelling is what makes it the dominant anode material in lithium-ion batteries .
in *num* , charles street of le carbone discovered a process for making artificial graphite .
another process to make synthetic graphite was invented accidentally by edward goodrich acheson ( 1856–1931 ) .
in the mid-1890s , acheson discovered that overheating carborundum ( silicon carbide or sic ) produced almost pure graphite .
while studying the effects of high temperature on carborundum , he had found that silicon vaporizes at about *num* , *num* °c ( *num* , *num* °f ) , leaving the carbon behind in graphitic carbon .
this graphite was another major discovery for him , and it became extremely valuable and helpful as a lubricant .
in *num* , acheson received a patent for his method of synthesizing graphite , and in *num* started commercial production .
the acheson graphite co .
was formed in *num* .
highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) is the highest-quality synthetic form of graphite .
it is used in scientific research , in particular , as a length standard for scanner calibration of scanning probe microscope .
graphite electrodes carry the electricity that melts scrap iron and steel , and sometimes direct-reduced iron ( dri ) , in electric arc furnaces , which are the vast majority of steel furnaces .
they are made from petroleum coke after it is mixed with coal tar pitch .
they are then extruded and shaped , baked to carbonize the binder ( pitch ) , and finally graphitized by heating it to temperatures approaching *num* °c , at which the carbon atoms arrange into graphite .
they can vary in size up to long and in diameter .
an increasing proportion of global steel is made using electric arc furnaces , and the electric arc furnace itself is becoming more efficient , making more steel per tonne of electrode .
an estimate based on usgs data indicates that graphite electrode consumption was *num* , *num* tonnes in *num* .
electrolytic aluminium smelting also uses graphitic carbon electrodes .
on a much smaller scale , synthetic graphite electrodes are used in electrical discharge machining ( edm ) , commonly to make injection molds for plastics .
the powder is made by heating powdered petroleum coke above the temperature of graphitization , sometimes with minor modifications .
the graphite scrap comes from pieces of unusable electrode material ( in the manufacturing stage or after use ) and lathe turnings , usually after crushing and sizing .
most synthetic graphite powder goes to carbon raising in steel ( competing with natural graphite ) , with some used in batteries and brake linings .
according to the usgs , us synthetic graphite powder and scrap production was *num* , *num* tonnes in *num* ( latest data ) .
special grades of synthetic graphite , such as gilsocarbon , also find use as a matrix and neutron moderator within nuclear reactors .
its low neutron cross-section also recommends it for use in proposed fusion reactors .
care must be taken that reactor-grade graphite is free of neutron absorbing materials such as boron , widely used as the seed electrode in commercial graphite deposition systems – this caused the failure of the germans ' world war ii graphite-based nuclear reactors .
since they could not isolate the difficulty they were forced to use far more expensive heavy water moderators .
graphite used for nuclear reactors is often referred to as nuclear graphite .
graphite ( carbon ) fiber and carbon nanotubes are also used in carbon fiber reinforced plastics , and in heat-resistant composites such as reinforced carbon-carbon ( rcc ) .
commercial structures made from carbon fiber graphite composites include fishing rods , golf club shafts , bicycle frames , sports car body panels , the fuselage of the boeing *num* dreamliner and pool cue sticks and have been successfully employed in reinforced concrete , the mechanical properties of carbon fiber graphite-reinforced plastic composites and grey cast iron are strongly influenced by the role of graphite in these materials .
in this context , the term " ( *num* % ) graphite " is often loosely used to refer to a pure mixture of carbon reinforcement and resin , while the term " composite " is used for composite materials with additional ingredients .
modern smokeless powder is coated in graphite to prevent the buildup of static charge .
graphite has been used in at least three radar absorbent materials .
it was mixed with rubber in sumpf and schornsteinfeger , which were used on u-boat snorkels to reduce their radar cross section .
it was also used in tiles on early f-117 nighthawk stealth strike fighters .
graphite composites are used as absorber for high-energy particles ( e .
g .
in the lhc beam dump ) .
graphite is mined by both open pit and underground methods .
graphite usually needs beneficiation .
this may be carried out by hand-picking the pieces of gangue ( rock ) and hand-screening the product or by crushing the rock and floating out the graphite .
beneficiation by flotation encounters the difficulty that graphite is very soft and " marks " ( coats ) the particles of gangue .
this makes the " marked " gangue particles float off with the graphite , yielding impure concentrate .
there are two ways of obtaining a commercial concentrate or product : repeated regrinding and floating ( up to seven times ) to purify the concentrate , or by acid leaching ( dissolving ) the gangue with hydrofluoric acid ( for a silicate gangue ) or hydrochloric acid ( for a carbonate gangue ) .
in milling , the incoming graphite products and concentrates can be ground before being classified ( sized or screened ) , with the coarser flake size fractions ( below *num* mesh , 8–20 mesh , 20–50 mesh ) carefully preserved , and then the carbon contents are determined .
some standard blends can be prepared from the different fractions , each with a certain flake size distribution and carbon content .
custom blends can also be made for individual customers who want a certain flake size distribution and carbon content .
if flake size is unimportant , the concentrate can be ground more freely .
typical end products include a fine powder for use as a slurry in oil drilling and coatings for foundry molds , carbon raiser in the steel industry ( synthetic graphite powder and powdered petroleum coke can also be used as carbon raiser ) .
environmental impacts from graphite mills consist of air pollution including fine particulate exposure of workers and also soil contamination from powder spillages leading to heavy metal contamination of soil .
according to the united states geological survey ( usgs ) , world production of natural graphite in *num* was *num* , *num* , *num* tonnes , of which the following major exporters are : china ( *num* , *num* t ) , india ( *num* , *num* t ) , brazil ( *num* , *num* t ) , turkey ( *num* , *num* t ) and north korea ( *num* , *num* t ) .
graphite is not mined in the united states , but u .
s .
production of synthetic graphite in *num* was *num* , *num* t valued at $1 .
*num* billion .
people can be exposed to graphite in the workplace by breathing it in , skin contact , and eye contact .
the occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) has set the legal limit ( permissible exposure limit ) for graphite exposure in the workplace as a time weighted average ( twa ) of *num* million particles per cubic foot ( *num* .
*num* mg / m ) over an 8-hour workday .
the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) has set a recommended exposure limit ( rel ) of twa *num* .
*num* mg / m respirable dust over an 8-hour workday .
at levels of *num* mg / m , graphite is immediately dangerous to life and health .
the most common way of recycling graphite occurs when synthetic graphite electrodes are either manufactured and pieces are cut off or lathe turnings are discarded , or the electrode ( or other ) are used all the way down to the electrode holder .
a new electrode replaces the old one , but a sizeable piece of the old electrode remains .
this is crushed and sized , and the resulting graphite powder is mostly used to raise the carbon content of molten steel .
graphite-containing refractories are sometimes also recycled , but often not because of their graphite : the largest-volume items , such as carbon-magnesite bricks that contain only 15–25 % graphite , usually contain too little graphite .
however , some recycled carbon–magnesite brick is used as the basis for furnace-repair materials , and also crushed carbon–magnesite brick is used in slag conditioners .
while crucibles have a high graphite content , the volume of crucibles used and then recycled is very small .
a high-quality flake graphite product that closely resembles natural flake graphite can be made from steelmaking kish .
kish is a large-volume near-molten waste skimmed from the molten iron feed to a basic oxygen furnace , and consists of a mix of graphite ( precipitated out of the supersaturated iron ) , lime-rich slag , and some iron .
the iron is recycled on site , leaving a mixture of graphite and slag .
the best recovery process uses hydraulic classification ( which utilizes a flow of water to separate minerals by specific gravity : graphite is light and settles nearly last ) to get a *num* % graphite rough concentrate .
leaching this concentrate with hydrochloric acid gives a *num* % graphite product with a flake size ranging from *num* mesh down .
claus sluter claus sluter ( 1340s in haarlem – *num* or *num* in dijon ) was a sculptor of dutch origin .
he was the most important northern european sculptor of his age and is considered a pioneer of the " northern realism " of the early netherlandish painting that came into full flower with the work of jan van eyck and others in the next generation .
the name " claes de slutere van herlam " is inscribed in the register of the corporation of stonemasons and sculptors of brussels around the years *num* / *num* .
he then moved to the burgundian capital of dijon , where from *num* to *num* he was the assistant of jean de marville , court sculptor to philip the bold , duke of burgundy .
from *num* to his death he was court sculptor himself , with the rank of " valet de chambre " .
he was succeeded by his nephew claus de werve .
sluter's most significant work is the so-called " well of moses " ( 1395–1403 ) , or the great cross was created for the carthusian monastery of champmol , which was founded by philip the bold right outside dijon in *num* .
for many years , the top portion was thought to have included ( along with christ on a cross ) , sculptures of the virgin and john the evangelist .
however it was more likely just christ , with mary magdalene kneeling at the foot of the cross .
the cross , and whatever was on the terrace below , was destroyed at some point after *num* and before *num* , probable because the roof of the building protecting the monument collapsed .
some fragments from the original cross are preserved in the musée archéologique de dijon .
life-sized figures representing old testament prophets and kings ( moses , david , daniel , jeremiah , zachariah , and isaiah ) stand around the base , holding phylacteries and books inscribed with verses from their respective texts , which were interpreted in the middle ages as typological prefigurations of the sacrifice of christ .
the work's physical structure , in which the old testament figures support those of the new dispensation , literalizes the typological iconography .
the pedestal surmounts a hexagonal fountain .
the entire monument is executed in limestone quarried from tonnerre and asnières .
a few steps away from the well of moses one finds the portal of the former mortuary chapel of champmol .
the portal consists of three sculptural groups by sluter : a standing madonna and child at the trumeau ; the duke and st .
john , his patron saint , at the left jamb and the duchess and her patron saint , catherine , at the right one .
sluter was also responsible for the main part of the work on philip's tomb , which ( restored and partly reconstructed ) has been moved to the museum of fine arts which is housed in the former ducal palace in dijon .
sluter was one of the sculptors of the pleurants , or mourners , which occupy niches below the tombs of philip the bold , his wife margaret , and john the fearless .
denaturation ( biochemistry ) denaturation is a process in which proteins or nucleic acids lose the quaternary structure , tertiary structure , and secondary structure which is present in their native state , by application of some external stress or compound such as a strong acid or base , a concentrated inorganic salt , an organic solvent ( e .
g .
, alcohol or chloroform ) , radiation or heat .
if proteins in a living cell are denatured , this results in disruption of cell activity and possibly cell death .
protein denaturation is also a consequence of cell death .
denatured proteins can exhibit a wide range of characteristics , from conformational change and loss of solubility to aggregation due to the exposure of hydrophobic groups .
denatured proteins lose their 3d structure and therefore cannot function .
protein folding is key to whether a globular or membrane protein can do its job correctly ; it must be folded into the right shape to function .
however , hydrogen bonds , which play a big part in folding , are rather weak and thus easily affected by heat , acidity , varying salt concentrations , and other stressors which can denature the protein .
this is one reason why tight homeostasis is physiologically necessary in many life forms .
this concept is unrelated to denatured alcohol , which is alcohol that has been mixed with additives to make it unsuitable for human consumption .
when food is cooked , some of its proteins become denatured .
this is why boiled eggs become hard and cooked meat becomes firm .
a classic example of denaturing in proteins comes from egg whites , which are typically largely egg albumins in water .
fresh from the eggs , egg whites are transparent and liquid .
cooking the thermally unstable whites turns them opaque , forming an interconnected solid mass .
the same transformation can be effected with a denaturing chemical .
pouring egg whites into a beaker of acetone will also turn egg whites translucent and solid .
the skin that forms on curdled milk is another common example of denatured protein .
the cold appetizer known as ceviche is prepared by chemically " cooking " raw fish and shellfish in an acidic citrus marinade , without heat .
denatured proteins can exhibit a wide range of characteristics , from loss of solubility to protein aggregation .
proteins or polypeptides are polymers of amino acids .
a protein is created by ribosomes that " read " rna that is encoded by codons in the gene and assemble the requisite amino acid combination from the genetic instruction , in a process known as translation .
the newly created protein strand then undergoes posttranslational modification , in which additional atoms or molecules are added , for example copper , zinc , or iron .
once this post-translational modification process has been completed , the protein begins to fold ( sometimes spontaneously and sometimes with enzymatic assistance ) , curling up on itself so that hydrophobic elements of the protein are buried deep inside the structure and hydrophilic elements end up on the outside .
the final shape of a protein determines how it interacts with its environment .
protein folding consists of a balance between a substantial amount of weak intra-molecular interactions within a protein ( hydrophobic , electrostatic , and van der waals interactions ) and protein-solvent interactions .
as a result , this process is heavily reliant on environmental state that the protein resides in .
these environmental conditions include , and are not limited to , temperature , salinity , pressure , and the solvents that happen to be involved .
consequently , any exposure to extreme stresses ( e .
g .
heat or radiation , high inorganic salt concentrations , strong acids and bases ) can disrupt a protein's interaction and inevitably lead to denaturation .
when a protein is denatured , secondary and tertiary structures are altered but the peptide bonds of the primary structure between the amino acids are left intact .
since all structural levels of the protein determine its function , the protein can no longer perform its function once it has been denatured .
this is in contrast to intrinsically unstructured proteins , which are unfolded in their native state , but still functionally active and tend to fold upon binding to their biological target .
most biological substrates lose their biological function when denatured .
for example , enzymes lose their activity , because the substrates can no longer bind to the active site , and because amino acid residues involved in stabilizing substrates ' transition states are no longer positioned to be able to do so .
the denaturing process and the associated loss of activity can be measured using techniques such as dual polarization interferometry , cd , qcm-d and mp-spr .
by targeting proteins , heavy metals have been known to disrupt the function and activity carried out by proteins .
it is important to note that heavy metals fall into categories consisting of transition metals as well as a select amount of metalloid .
these metals , when interacting with native , folded proteins , tend to play a role in obstructing their biological activity .
this interference can be carried out in a different number of ways .
these heavy metals can form a complex with the functional side chain groups present in a protein or form bonds to free thiols .
heavy metals also play a role in oxidizing amino acid side chains present in protein .
along with this , when interacting with metalloproteins , heavy metals can dislocate and replace key metal ions .
as a result , heavy metals can interfere with folded proteins , which can strongly deter protein stability and activity .
in many cases , denaturation is reversible ( the proteins can regain their native state when the denaturing influence is removed ) .
this process can be called renaturation .
this understanding has led to the notion that all the information needed for proteins to assume their native state was encoded in the primary structure of the protein , and hence in the dna that codes for the protein , the so-called " anfinsen's thermodynamic hypothesis " .
denaturation can also be irreversible .
this irreversibility is typically a kinetic , not thermodynamic irreversibility , as generally when a protein is folded it has lower free energy .
through kinetic irreversibility , the fact that the protein is stuck in a local minimum can stop it from ever refolding after it has been irreversibly denatured .
denaturation can also be caused by changes in the ph which can affect the chemistry of the amino acids and their residues .
the ionizable groups in amino acids are able to become ionized when changes in ph occur .
a ph change to more acidic or more basic conditions can induce unfolding .
acid-induced unfolding often occurs between ph *num* and *num* , base-induced unfolding usually requires ph *num* or higher .
nucleic acids ( including rna and dna ) are nucleotide polymers synthesized by polymerase enzymes during either transcription or dna replication .
following 5'-3 ' synthesis of the backbone , individual nitrogenous bases are capable of interacting with one another via hydrogen bonding , thus allowing for the formation of higher-order structures .
nucleic acid denaturation occurs when hydrogen bonding between nucleotides is disrupted , and results in the separation of previously annealed strands .
for example , denaturation of dna due to high temperatures results in the disruption of base pairs and the separation of the double stranded helix into two single strands .
nucleic acid strands are capable of re-annealling when " normal " conditions are restored , but if restoration occurs too quickly , the nucleic acid strands may re-anneal imperfectly resulting in the improper pairing of bases .
the non-covalent interactions between antiparallel strands in dna can be broken in order to " open " the double helix when biologically important mechanisms such as dna replication , transcription , dna repair or protein binding are set to occur .
the area of partially separated dna is known as the denaturation bubble , which can be more specifically defined as the opening of a dna double helix through the coordinated separation of base pairs .
the first model that attempted to describe the thermodynamics of the denaturation bubble was introduced in *num* and called the poland-scheraga model .
this model describes the denaturation of dna strands as a function of temperature .
as the temperature increases , the hydrogen bonds between the watson and crick base pairs are increasingly disturbed and " denatured loops " begin to form .
however , the poland-scheraga model is now considered elementary because it fails to account for the confounding implications of dna sequence , chemical composition , stiffness and torsion .
recent thermodynamic studies have inferred that the lifetime of a singular denaturation bubble ranges from *num* microsecond to *num* millisecond .
this information is based on established timescales of dna replication and transcription .
currently , biophysical and biochemical research studies are being performed to more fully elucidate the thermodynamic details of the denaturation bubble .
with polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) being among the most popular contexts in which dna denaturation is desired , heating is the most frequent method of denaturation .
other than denaturation by heat , nucleic acids can undergo the denaturation process through various chemical agents such as formamide , guanidine , sodium salicylate , dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ) , propylene glycol , and urea .
these chemical denaturing agents lower the melting temperature ( t ) by competing for hydrogen bond donors and acceptors with pre-existing nitrogenous base pairs .
some agents are even able to induce denaturation at room temperature .
for example , alkaline agents ( e .
g .
naoh ) have been shown to denature dna by changing ph and removing hydrogen-bond contributing protons .
these denaturants have been employed to make denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis gel ( dgge ) , which promotes denaturation of nucleic acids in order to eliminate the influence of nucleic acid shape on their electrophoretic mobility .
the optical activity ( absorption and scattering of light ) and hydrodynamic properties ( translational diffusion , sedimentation coefficients , and rotational correlation times ) of formamide denatured nucleic acids are similar to those of heat-denatured nucleic acids .
therefore , depending on the desired effect , chemically denaturing dna can provide a gentler procedure for denaturing nucleic acids than denaturation induced by heat .
studies comparing different denaturation methods such as heating , beads mill of different bead sizes , probe sonification , and chemical denaturation show that chemical denaturation can provide quicker denaturation compared to the other physical denaturation methods described .
particularly in cases where rapid renaturation is desired , chemical denaturation agents can provide an ideal alternative to heating .
for example , dna strands denatured with alkaline agents such as naoh renature as soon as phosphate buffer is added .
small , electronegative molecules such as nitrogen and oxygen , which are the primary gases in air , significantly impact the ability of surrounding molecules to participate in hydrogen bonding .
these molecules compete with surrounding hydrogen bond acceptors for hydrogen bond donors , therefore acting as " hydrogen bond breakers " and weakening interactions between surrounding molecules in the environment .
antiparellel strands in dna double helices are non-covalently bound by hydrogen bonding between watson and crick base pairs ; nitrogen and oxygen therefore maintain the potential to weaken the integrity of dna when exposed to air .
as a result , dna strands exposed to air require less force to separate and exemplify lower melting temperatures .
many laboratory techniques rely on the ability of nucleic acid strands to separate .
by understanding the properties of nucleic acid denaturation , the following methods were created : acidic protein denaturants include : bases work similarly to acids in denaturation .
food food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism .
it is usually of plant or animal origin , and contains essential nutrients , such as carbohydrates , fats , proteins , vitamins , or minerals .
the substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy , maintain life , or stimulate growth .
historically , humans secured food through two methods : hunting and gathering and agriculture .
today , the majority of the food energy required by the ever increasing population of the world is supplied by the food industry .
food safety and food security are monitored by agencies like the international association for food protection , world resources institute , world food programme , food and agriculture organization , and international food information council .
they address issues such as sustainability , biological diversity , climate change , nutritional economics , population growth , water supply , and access to food .
the right to food is a human right derived from the international covenant on economic , social and cultural rights ( icescr ) , recognizing the " right to an adequate standard of living , including adequate food " , as well as the " fundamental right to be free from hunger " .
most food has its origin in plants .
some food is obtained directly from plants ; but even animals that are used as food sources are raised by feeding them food derived from plants .
cereal grain is a staple food that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop .
corn ( maize ) , wheat , and rice – in all of their varieties – account for *num* % of all grain production worldwide .
most of the grain that is produced worldwide is fed to livestock .
some foods not from animal or plant sources include various edible fungi , especially mushrooms .
fungi and ambient bacteria are used in the preparation of fermented and pickled foods like leavened bread , alcoholic drinks , cheese , pickles , kombucha , and yogurt .
another example is blue-green algae such as spirulina .
inorganic substances such as salt , baking soda and cream of tartar are used to preserve or chemically alter an ingredient .
many plants and plant parts are eaten as food and around *num* , *num* plant species are cultivated for food .
many of these plant species have several distinct cultivars .
seeds of plants are a good source of food for animals , including humans , because they contain the nutrients necessary for the plant's initial growth , including many healthful fats , such as omega fats .
in fact , the majority of food consumed by human beings are seed-based foods .
edible seeds include cereals ( corn , wheat , rice , et cetera ) , legumes ( beans , peas , lentils , et cetera ) , and nuts .
oilseeds are often pressed to produce rich oils - sunflower , flaxseed , rapeseed ( including canola oil ) , sesame , et cetera .
seeds are typically high in unsaturated fats and , in moderation , are considered a health food .
however , not all seeds are edible .
large seeds , such as those from a lemon , pose a choking hazard , while seeds from cherries and apples contain cyanide which could be poisonous only if consumed in large volumes .
fruits are the ripened ovaries of plants , including the seeds within .
many plants and animals have coevolved such that the fruits of the former are an attractive food source to the latter , because animals that eat the fruits may excrete the seeds some distance away .
fruits , therefore , make up a significant part of the diets of most cultures .
some botanical fruits , such as tomatoes , pumpkins , and eggplants , are eaten as vegetables .
( for more information , see list of fruits .
) vegetables are a second type of plant matter that is commonly eaten as food .
these include root vegetables ( potatoes and carrots ) , bulbs ( onion family ) , leaf vegetables ( spinach and lettuce ) , ( bamboo shoots and asparagus ) , and ( globe artichokes and broccoli and other vegetables such as cabbage or cauliflower ) .
animals are used as food either directly or indirectly by the products they produce .
meat is an example of a direct product taken from an animal , which comes from muscle systems or from organs .
food products produced by animals include milk produced by mammary glands , which in many cultures is drunk or processed into dairy products ( cheese , butter , etc .
) .
in addition , birds and other animals lay eggs , which are often eaten , and bees produce honey , a reduced nectar from flowers , which is a popular sweetener in many cultures .
some cultures consume blood , sometimes in the form of blood sausage , as a thickener for sauces , or in a cured , salted form for times of food scarcity , and others use blood in stews such as jugged hare .
some cultures and people do not consume meat or animal food products for cultural , dietary , health , ethical , or ideological reasons .
vegetarians choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees .
vegans do not consume any foods that are or contain ingredients from an animal source .
adulteration is a legal term meaning that a food product fails to meet the legal standards .
one form of adulteration is an addition of another substance to a food item in order to increase the quantity of the food item in raw form or prepared form , which may result in the loss of actual quality of food item .
these substances may be either available food items or non-food items .
among meat and meat products some of the items used to adulterate are water or ice , carcasses , or carcasses of animals other than the animal meant to be consumed .
camping food includes ingredients used to prepare food suitable for backcountry camping and backpacking .
the foods differ substantially from the ingredients found in a typical home kitchen .
the primary differences relate to campers ' and backpackers ' special needs for foods that have appropriate cooking time , perishability , weight , and nutritional content .
to address these needs , camping food is often made up of either freeze-dried , precooked or dehydrated ingredients .
many campers use a combination of these foods .
freeze-drying requires the use of heavy machinery and is not something that most campers are able to do on their own .
freeze-dried ingredients are often considered superior to dehydrated ingredients however , because they rehydrate at camp faster and retain more flavor than their dehydrated counterparts .
freeze-dried ingredients take so little time to rehydrate that they can often be eaten without cooking them first and have a texture similar to a crunchy chip .
dehydration can reduce the weight of the food by sixty to ninety percent by removing water through evaporation .
some foods dehydrate well , such as onions , peppers , and tomatoes .
dehydration often produces a more compact , albeit slightly heavier , end result than freeze-drying .
surplus precooked military meals , meals , ready-to-eat ( mres ) are sometimes used by campers .
these meals contain precooked foods in retort pouches .
a retort pouch is a plastic and metal foil laminate pouch that is used as an alternative to traditional industrial canning methods .
diet food ( or " dietetic food " ) refers to any food or beverage whose recipe is altered to reduce fat , carbohydrates , abhor / adhore sugar in order to make it part of a weight loss program or diet .
such foods are usually intended to assist in weight loss or a change in body type , although bodybuilding supplements are designed to aid in gaining weight or muscle .
the process of making a diet version of a food usually requires finding an acceptable low-food-energy substitute for some high-food-energy ingredient .
this can be as simple as replacing some or all of the food's sugar with a sugar substitute as is common with diet soft drinks such as coca-cola ( for example diet coke ) .
in some snacks , the food may be baked instead of fried thus reducing the food energy .
in other cases , low-fat ingredients may be used as replacements .
in whole grain foods , the higher fiber content effectively displaces some of the starch component of the flour .
since certain fibers have no food energy , this results in a modest energy reduction .
another technique relies on the intentional addition of other reduced-food-energy ingredients , such as resistant starch or dietary fiber , to replace part of the flour and achieve a more significant energy reduction .
finger food is food meant to be eaten directly using the hands , in contrast to food eaten with a knife and fork , spoon , chopsticks , or other utensils .
in some cultures , food is almost always eaten with the hands ; for example , ethiopian cuisine is eaten by rolling various dishes up in " injera " bread .
foods considered street foods are frequently , though not exclusively , finger foods .
in the western world , finger foods are often either appetizers ( hors d'œuvres ) or entree / main course items .
examples of these are miniature meat pies , sausage rolls , sausages on sticks , cheese and olives on sticks , chicken drumsticks or wings , spring rolls , miniature quiches , samosas , sandwiches , merenda or other such based foods , such as pitas or items in buns , bhajjis , potato wedges , vol au vents , several other such small items and risotto balls ( arancini ) .
other well-known foods that are generally eaten with the hands include hamburgers , pizza , chips , hot dogs , fruit and bread .
in east asia , foods like pancakes or flatbreads ( " bing " 饼 ) and street foods such as chuan ( 串 , also pronounced " chuan " ) are often eaten with the hands .
fresh food is food which has not been preserved and has not spoiled yet .
for vegetables and fruits , this means that they have been recently harvested and treated properly postharvest ; for meat , it has recently been slaughtered and butchered ; for fish , it has been recently caught or harvested and kept cold .
dairy products are fresh and will spoil quickly .
thus , fresh cheese is cheese which has not been dried or salted for aging .
soured cream may be considered " fresh " ( crème fraîche ) .
fresh food has not been dried , smoked , salted , frozen , canned , pickled , or otherwise preserved .
freezing food preserves it from the time it is prepared to the time it is eaten .
since early times , farmers , fishermen , and trappers have preserved grains and produce in unheated buildings during the winter season .
freezing food slows down decomposition by turning residual moisture into ice , inhibiting the growth of most bacterial species .
in the food commodity industry , there are two processes : mechanical and cryogenic ( or flash freezing ) .
the freezing kinetics is important to preserve the food quality and texture .
quicker freezing generates smaller ice crystals and maintains cellular structure .
cryogenic freezing is the quickest freezing technology available due to the ultra low liquid nitrogen temperature .
preserving food in domestic kitchens during modern times is achieved using household freezers .
accepted advice to householders was to freeze food on the day of purchase .
an initiative by a supermarket group in *num* ( backed by the uk's waste & resources action programme ) promotes the freezing of food " as soon as possible up to the product's ' use by ' date " .
the food standards agency was reported as supporting the change , providing the food had been stored correctly up to that time .
a functional food is a food given an additional function ( often one related to health-promotion or disease prevention ) by adding new ingredients or more of existing ingredients .
the term may also apply to traits purposely bred into existing edible plants , such as purple or gold potatoes having enriched anthocyanin or carotenoid contents , respectively .
functional foods may be " designed to have physiological benefits and / or reduce the risk of chronic disease beyond basic nutritional functions , and may be similar in appearance to conventional food and consumed as part of a regular diet " .
the term was first used in japan in the 1980s where there is a government approval process for functional foods called foods for specified health use ( foshu ) .
health food is food marketed to provide human health effects beyond a normal healthy diet required for human nutrition .
foods marketed as health foods may be part of one or more categories , such as natural foods , organic foods , whole foods , vegetarian foods or dietary supplements .
these products may be sold in health food stores or in the health food or organic sections of grocery stores .
a healthy diet is a diet that helps to maintain or improve overall health .
a healthy diet provides the body with essential nutrition : fluid , macronutrients , micronutrients , and adequate calories .
for people who are healthy , a healthy diet is not complicated and contains mostly fruits , vegetables , and whole grains , and includes little to no processed food and sweetened beverages .
the requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods , although a non-animal source of vitamin b12 is needed for those following a vegan diet .
various nutrition guides are published by medical and governmental institutions to educate individuals on what they should be eating to be healthy .
nutrition facts labels are also mandatory in some countries to allow consumers to choose between foods based on the components relevant to health .
a healthy lifestyle includes getting exercise every day along with eating a healthy diet .
a healthy lifestyle may lower disease risks , such as obesity , heart disease , type *num* diabetes , hypertension and cancer .
there are specialized healthy diets , called medical nutrition therapy , for people with various diseases or conditions .
there are also prescientific ideas about such specialized diets , as in dietary therapy in traditional chinese medicine .
the world health organization ( who ) makes the following *num* recommendations with respect to both populations and individuals : kosher foods are those that conform to the jewish dietary regulations of " kashrut " ( dietary law ) , primarily derived from leviticus and deuteronomy .
food that may be consumed according to " halakha " ( law ) is termed " kosher " ( ) in english , from the ashkenazi pronunciation of the hebrew term " kashér " ( ) , meaning " fit " ( in this context , fit for consumption ) .
food that is not in accordance with law is called " treif " ( ; , derived from " trāfáh " ) meaning " torn .
" live food is living food for carnivorous or omnivorous animals kept in captivity ; in other words , small animals such as insects or mice fed to larger carnivorous or omnivorous species kept in either in a zoo or as pet .
live food is commonly used as feed for a variety of species of exotic pets and zoo animals , ranging from alligators to various snakes , frogs and lizards , but also including other , non-reptile , non-amphibian carnivores and omnivores ( for instance , skunks , which are omnivorous mammals , can be technically be fed a limited amount of live food , though this is not known to be a common practice ) .
common live food ranges from crickets ( used as an inexpensive form of feed for carnivorous and omnivorous reptiles such as bearded dragons and commonly available in pet stores for this reason ) , waxworms , mealworms and to a lesser extent cockroaches and locusts , to small birds and mammals such as mice or chickens .
medical foods are foods that are specially formulated and intended for the dietary management of a disease that has distinctive nutritional needs that cannot be met by normal diet alone .
in the united states they were defined in the food and drug administration's *num* orphan drug act amendments and are subject to the general food and safety labeling requirements of the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act .
in europe the european food safety authority established definitions for " foods for special medical purposes " ( fsmps ) in *num* .
medical foods , called " food for special medical purposes " in europe , are distinct from the broader category of foods for special dietary use , from traditional foods that bear a health claim , and from dietary supplements .
in order to be considered a medical food the product must , at a minimum : medical foods can be classified into the following categories : natural foods and " all natural foods " are widely used terms in food labeling and marketing with a variety of definitions , most of which are vague .
the term is often assumed to imply foods that are not processed and whose ingredients are all natural products ( in the chemist's sense of that term ) , thus conveying an appeal to nature .
but the lack of standards in most jurisdictions means that the term assures nothing .
in some countries , the term " natural " is defined and enforced .
in others , such as the united states , it is not enforced .
“natural foods” are often assumed to be foods that are not processed , or do not contain any food additives , or do not contain particular additives such as hormones , antibiotics , sweeteners , food colors , or flavorings that were not originally in the food .
in fact , many people ( *num* % ) when surveyed showed a preference for products labeled " natural " compared to the unmarked counterparts , based on the common belief ( *num* % of polled consumers ) that the term " natural " indicated that the food does not contain any artificial ingredients .
the terms are variously used and misused on labels and in advertisements .
the international food and agriculture organization’s " codex alimentarius " does not recognize the term “natural” but does have a standard for organic foods .
a negative-calorie food is food that supposedly requires more food energy to be digested than the food provides .
its thermic effect or specific dynamic action – the caloric " cost " of digesting the food – would be greater than its food energy content .
despite its recurring popularity in dieting guides , there is no scientific evidence supporting the idea that any food is calorically negative .
while some chilled beverages are calorically negative , the effect is minimal and drinking large amounts of water can be dangerous .
organic food is food produced by methods that comply with the standards of organic farming .
standards vary worldwide , but organic farming in general features practices that strive to cycle resources , promote ecological balance , and conserve biodiversity .
organizations regulating organic products may restrict the use of certain pesticides and fertilizers in farming .
in general , organic foods are also usually not processed using irradiation , industrial solvents or synthetic food additives .
currently , the european union , the united states , canada , mexico , japan , and many other countries require producers to obtain special certification in order to market food as organic within their borders .
in the context of these regulations , organic food is produced in a way that complies with organic standards set by regional organizations , national governments and international organizations .
although the produce of kitchen gardens may be organic , selling food with an organic label is regulated by governmental food safety authorities , such as the us department of agriculture ( usda ) or european commission ( ec ) .
fertilizing and the use of pesticides in conventional farming has caused , and is causing , enormous damage worldwide to local ecosystems , biodiversity , groundwater and drinking water supplies , and sometimes farmer health and fertility .
these environmental , economic and health issues are intended to be minimized or avoided in organic farming .
from a consumers perspective , there is not sufficient evidence in scientific and medical literature to support claims that organic food is safer or healthier to eat than conventionally grown food .
while there may be some differences in the nutrient and antinutrient contents of organically- and conventionally-produced food , the variable nature of food production and handling makes it difficult to generalize results .
claims that organic food tastes better are generally not supported by tests .
peasant foods are dishes specific to a particular culture , made from accessible and inexpensive ingredients , and usually prepared and seasoned to make them more palatable .
they often form a significant part of the diets of people who live in poverty , or have a lower income compared to the average for their society or country .
peasant foods have been described as being the diet of peasants , that is , tenant or poorer farmers and their farm workers , and by extension , of other cash-poor people .
they may use ingredients , such as offal and less-tender cuts of meat , which are not as marketable as a cash crop .
characteristic recipes often consist of hearty one-dish meals , in which chunks of meat and various vegetables are eaten in a savory broth , with bread or other staple food .
sausages are also amenable to varied readily available ingredients , and they themselves tend to contain offal and grains .
peasant foods often involve skilled preparation by knowledgeable cooks using inventiveness and skills passed down from earlier generations .
such dishes are often prized as ethnic foods by other cultures and by descendants of the native culture who still desire these traditional dishes .
prison food is the term for meals served to prisoners while incarcerated in correctional institutions .
while some prisons prepare their own food , many use staff from on-site catering companies .
many prisons today support the requirements of specific religions , as well as vegetarianism .
it is said that prison food of many developed countries is adequate to maintain health and dieting .
"seasonal " here refers to the times of year when the harvest or the flavour of a given type food is at its peak .
this is usually the time when the item is harvested , with some exceptions ; an example being sweet potatoes which are best eaten quite a while after harvest .
it also appeals to people who prefer a low carbon diet that reduces the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from food consumption ( food miles ) .
shelf-stable food ( sometimes ambient food ) is food of a type that can be safely stored at room temperature in a sealed container .
this includes foods that would normally be stored refrigerated but which have been processed so that they can be safely stored at room or ambient temperature for a usefully long shelf life .
various food preservation and packaging techniques are used to extend a food's shelf life .
decreasing the amount of available water in a product , increasing its acidity , or irradiating or otherwise sterilizing the food and then sealing it in an air-tight container are all ways of depriving bacteria of suitable conditions in which to thrive .
all of these approaches can all extend a food's shelf life without unacceptably changing its taste or texture .
for some foods alternative ingredients can be used .
common oils and fats become rancid relatively quickly if not refrigerated ; replacing them with hydrogenated oils delays the onset of rancidity , increasing shelf life .
this is a common approach in industrial food production , but recent concerns about health hazards associated with trans fats have led to their strict control in several jurisdictions .
even where trans fats are not prohibited , in many places there are new labeling laws ( or rules ) , which require information to be printed on packages , or to be published elsewhere , about the amount of trans fat contained in certain products .
space food is a type of food product created and processed for consumption by astronauts in outer space .
the food has specific requirements of providing balanced nutrition for individuals working in space , while being easy and safe to store , prepare and consume in the machinery-filled weightless environments of manned spacecraft .
in recent years , space food has been used by various nations engaging on space programs as a way to share and show off their cultural identity and facilitate intercultural communication .
although astronauts consume a wide variety of foods and beverages in space , the initial idea from the man in space committee of the space science board in *num* was to supply astronauts with a formula diet that would supply all the needed vitamins and nutrients .
traditional foods are foods and dishes that are passed through generations or which have been consumed many generations .
traditional foods and dishes are traditional in nature , and may have a historic precedent in a national dish , regional cuisine or local cuisine .
traditional foods and beverages may be produced as homemade , by restaurants and small manufacturers , and by large food processing plant facilities .
some traditional foods have geographical indications and traditional specialities in the european union designations per european union schemes of geographical indications and traditional specialties : protected designation of origin ( pdo ) , protected geographical indication ( pgi ) and traditional specialities guaranteed ( tsg ) .
these standards serve to promote and protect names of quality agricultural products and foodstuffs .
this article also includes information about traditional beverages .
whole foods are plant foods that are unprocessed and unrefined , or processed and refined as little as possible , before being consumed .
examples of whole foods include whole grains , tubers , legumes , fruits , vegetables .
there is some confusion over the usage of the term surrounding the inclusion of certain foods , in particular animal foods .
the modern usage of the term whole foods diet is now widely synonymous with " whole foods plant-based diet " with animal products , oil and salt no longer constituting whole foods .
the earliest use of the term in the post-industrial age appears to be in *num* in the farmer , a quarterly magazine published and edited from his farm by f .
newman turner , a writer and pioneering organic farmer .
the magazine sponsored the establishment of the producer consumer whole food society ltd , with newman turner as president and derek randal as vice-president .
whole food was defined as " mature produce of field , orchard , or garden without subtraction , addition , or alteration grown from seed without chemical dressing , in fertile soil manured solely with animal and vegetable wastes , and composts therefrom , and ground , raw rock and without chemical manures , sprays , or insecticides , " having intent to connect suppliers and the growing public demand for such food .
such diets are rich in whole and unrefined foods , like whole grains , dark green and yellow / orange-fleshed vegetables and fruits , legumes , nuts and seeds .
most food has always been obtained through agriculture .
with increasing concern over both the methods and products of modern industrial agriculture , there has been a growing trend toward sustainable agricultural practices .
this approach , partly fueled by consumer demand , encourages biodiversity , local self-reliance and organic farming methods .
major influences on food production include international organizations ( e .
g .
the world trade organization and common agricultural policy ) , national government policy ( or law ) , and war .
in popular culture , the mass production of food , specifically meats such as chicken and beef , has come under fire from various documentaries , most recently food , inc , documenting the mass slaughter and poor treatment of animals , often for easier revenues from large corporations .
along with a current trend towards environmentalism , people in western culture have had an increasing trend towards the use of herbal supplements , foods for a specific group of people ( such as dieters , women , or athletes ) , functional foods ( fortified foods , such as omega-3 eggs ) , and a more ethnically diverse diet .
several organisations have begun calling for a new kind of agriculture in which agroecosystems provide food but also support vital ecosystem services so that soil fertility and biodiversity are maintained rather than compromised .
according to the international water management institute and unep , well-managed agroecosystems not only provide food , fiber and animal products , they also provide services such as flood mitigation , groundwater recharge , erosion control and habitats for plants , birds , fish and other animals .
animals , specifically humans , have five different types of tastes : sweet , sour , salty , bitter , and umami .
as animals have evolved , the tastes that provide the most energy ( sugar and fats ) are the most pleasant to eat while others , such as bitter , are not enjoyable .
water , while important for survival , has no taste .
fats , on the other hand , especially saturated fats , are thicker and rich and are thus considered more enjoyable to eat .
generally regarded as the most pleasant taste , sweetness is almost always caused by a type of simple sugar such as glucose or fructose , or disaccharides such as sucrose , a molecule combining glucose and fructose .
complex carbohydrates are long chains and thus do not have the sweet taste .
artificial sweeteners such as sucralose are used to mimic the sugar molecule , creating the sensation of sweet , without the calories .
other types of sugar include raw sugar , which is known for its amber color , as it is unprocessed .
as sugar is vital for energy and survival , the taste of sugar is pleasant .
the stevia plant contains a compound known as steviol which , when extracted , has *num* times the sweetness of sugar while having minimal impact on blood sugar .
sourness is caused by the taste of acids , such as vinegar in alcoholic beverages .
sour foods include citrus , specifically lemons , limes , and to a lesser degree oranges .
sour is evolutionarily significant as it is a sign for a food that may have gone rancid due to bacteria .
many foods , however , are slightly acidic , and help stimulate the taste buds and enhance flavor .
saltiness is the taste of alkali metal ions such as sodium and potassium .
it is found in almost every food in low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor , although to eat pure salt is regarded as highly unpleasant .
there are many different types of salt , with each having a different degree of saltiness , including sea salt , fleur de sel , kosher salt , mined salt , and grey salt .
other than enhancing flavor , its significance is that the body needs and maintains a delicate electrolyte balance , which is the kidney's function .
salt may be iodized , meaning iodine has been added to it , a necessary nutrient that promotes thyroid function .
some canned foods , notably soups or packaged broths , tend to be high in salt as a means of preserving the food longer .
historically salt has long been used as a meat preservative as salt promotes water excretion .
similarly , dried foods also promote food safety .
bitterness is a sensation often considered unpleasant characterized by having a sharp , pungent taste .
unsweetened dark chocolate , caffeine , lemon rind , and some types of fruit are known to be bitter .
umami , the japanese word for delicious , is the least known in western popular culture but has a long tradition in asian cuisine .
umami is the taste of glutamates , especially monosodium glutamate ( msg ) .
it is characterized as savory , meaty , and rich in flavor .
salmon and mushrooms are foods high in umami .
many scholars claim that the rhetorical function of food is to represent the culture of a country , and that it can be used as a form of communication .
according to goode , curtis and theophano , food " is the last aspect of an ethnic culture to be lost " .
many cultures have a recognizable cuisine , a specific set of cooking traditions using various spices or a combination of flavors unique to that culture , which evolves over time .
other differences include preferences ( hot or cold , spicy , etc .
) and practices , the study of which is known as gastronomy .
many cultures have diversified their foods by means of preparation , cooking methods , and manufacturing .
this also includes a complex food trade which helps the cultures to economically survive by way of food , not just by consumption .
some popular types of ethnic foods include italian , french , japanese , chinese , american , cajun , thai , african , indian and nepalese .
various cultures throughout the world study the dietary analysis of food habits .
while evolutionarily speaking , as opposed to culturally , humans are omnivores , religion and social constructs such as morality , activism , or environmentalism will often affect which foods they will consume .
food is eaten and typically enjoyed through the sense of taste , the perception of flavor from eating and drinking .
certain tastes are more enjoyable than others , for evolutionary purposes .
aesthetically pleasing and eye-appealing food presentations can encourage people to consume foods .
a common saying is that people " eat with their eyes " .
food presented in a clean and appetizing way will encourage a good flavor , even if unsatisfactory .
texture plays a crucial role in the enjoyment of eating foods .
contrasts in textures , such as something crunchy in an otherwise smooth dish , may increase the appeal of eating it .
common examples include adding granola to yogurt , adding croutons to a salad or soup , and toasting bread to enhance its crunchiness for a smooth topping , such as jam or butter .
another universal phenomenon regarding food is the appeal of contrast in taste and presentation .
for example , such opposite flavors as sweetness and saltiness tend to go well together , as in kettle corn and nuts .
while many foods can be eaten raw , many also undergo some form of preparation for reasons of safety , palatability , texture , or flavor .
at the simplest level this may involve washing , cutting , trimming , or adding other foods or ingredients , such as spices .
it may also involve mixing , heating or cooling , pressure cooking , fermentation , or combination with other food .
in a home , most food preparation takes place in a kitchen .
some preparation is done to enhance the taste or aesthetic appeal ; other preparation may help to preserve the food ; others may be involved in cultural identity .
a meal is made up of food which is prepared to be eaten at a specific time and place .
the preparation of animal-based food usually involves slaughter , evisceration , hanging , portioning , and rendering .
in developed countries , this is usually done outside the home in slaughterhouses , which are used to process animals en masse for meat production .
many countries regulate their slaughterhouses by law .
for example , the united states has established the humane slaughter act of *num* , which requires that an animal be stunned before killing .
this act , like those in many countries , exempts slaughter in accordance to religious law , such as kosher , shechita , and dhabīḥah halal .
strict interpretations of kashrut require the animal to be fully aware when its carotid artery is cut .
on the local level , a butcher may commonly break down larger animal meat into smaller manageable cuts , and pre-wrap them for commercial sale or wrap them to order in butcher paper .
in addition , fish and seafood may be fabricated into smaller cuts by a fish monger .
however , fish butchery may be done on board a fishing vessel and quick-frozen for preservation of quality .
the term " cooking " encompasses a vast range of methods , tools , and combinations of ingredients to improve the flavor or digestibility of food .
cooking technique , known as culinary art , generally requires the selection , measurement , and combining of ingredients in an ordered procedure in an effort to achieve the desired result .
constraints on success include the variability of ingredients , ambient conditions , tools , and the skill of the individual cook .
the diversity of cooking worldwide is a reflection of the myriad nutritional , aesthetic , agricultural , economic , cultural , and religious considerations that affect it .
cooking requires applying heat to a food which usually , though not always , chemically changes the molecules , thus changing its flavor , texture , appearance , and nutritional properties .
cooking certain proteins , such as egg whites , meats , and fish , denatures the protein , causing it to firm .
there is archaeological evidence of roasted foodstuffs at " homo erectus " campsites dating from *num* , *num* years ago .
boiling as a means of cooking requires a container , and has been practiced at least since the *ord* millennium bc with the introduction of pottery .
there are many different types of equipment used for cooking .
ovens are mostly hollow devices that get very hot ( up to ) and are used for baking or roasting and offer a dry-heat cooking method .
different cuisines will use different types of ovens .
for example , indian culture uses a tandoor oven , which is a cylindrical clay oven which operates at a single high temperature .
western kitchens use variable temperature convection ovens , conventional ovens , toaster ovens , or non-radiant heat ovens like the microwave oven .
classic italian cuisine includes the use of a brick oven containing burning wood .
ovens may be wood-fired , coal-fired , gas , electric , or oil-fired .
various types of cook-tops are used as well .
they carry the same variations of fuel types as the ovens mentioned above .
cook-tops are used to heat vessels placed on top of the heat source , such as a sauté pan , sauce pot , frying pan , or pressure cooker .
these pieces of equipment can use either a moist or dry cooking method and include methods such as steaming , simmering , boiling , and poaching for moist methods , while the dry methods include sautéing , pan frying , and deep-frying .
in addition , many cultures use grills for cooking .
a grill operates with a radiant heat source from below , usually covered with a metal grid and sometimes a cover .
an open pit barbecue in the american south is one example along with the american style outdoor grill fueled by wood , liquid propane , or charcoal along with soaked wood chips for smoking .
a mexican style of barbecue is called barbacoa , which involves the cooking of meats such as whole sheep over an open fire .
in argentina , an asado ( spanish for " grilled " ) is prepared on a grill held over an open pit or fire made upon the ground , on which a whole animal or smaller cuts are grilled .
certain cultures highlight animal and vegetable foods in a raw state .
salads consisting of raw vegetables or fruits are common in many cuisines .
sashimi in japanese cuisine consists of raw sliced fish or other meat , and sushi often incorporates raw fish or seafood .
steak tartare and salmon tartare are dishes made from diced or ground raw beef or salmon , mixed with various ingredients and served with baguettes , brioche , or frites .
in italy , carpaccio is a dish of very thinly sliced raw beef , drizzled with a vinaigrette made with olive oil .
the health food movement known as raw foodism promotes a mostly vegan diet of raw fruits , vegetables , and grains prepared in various ways , including juicing , food dehydration , sprouting , and other methods of preparation that do not heat the food above .
an example of a raw meat dish is ceviche , a latin american dish made with raw meat that is " cooked " from the highly acidic citric juice from lemons and limes along with other aromatics such as garlic .
restaurants employ chefs to prepare the food , and waiters to serve customers at the table .
the term restaurant comes from an old term for a restorative meat broth ; this broth ( or bouillon ) was served in elegant outlets in paris from the mid *ord* century .
these refined " restaurants " were a marked change from the usual basic eateries such as inns and taverns , and some had developed from early parisian cafés , such as café procope , by first serving bouillon , then adding other cooked food to their menus .
commercial eateries existed during the roman period , with evidence of *num* " thermopolia " , a form of fast food restaurant , found in pompeii , and urban sales of prepared foods may have existed in china during the song dynasty .
in *num* , the population of the united states spent $496 billion on out-of-home dining .
expenditures by type of out-of-home dining were as follows : *num* % in full-service restaurants , *num* .
*num* % in limited service restaurants ( fast food ) , *num* .
*num* % in schools or colleges , *num* .
*num* % in bars and vending machines , *num* .
*num* % in hotels and motels , *num* .
*num* % in recreational places , and *num* .
*num* % in others , which includes military bases .
packaged foods are manufactured outside the home for purchase .
this can be as simple as a butcher preparing meat , or as complex as a modern international food industry .
early food processing techniques were limited by available food preservation , packaging , and transportation .
this mainly involved salting , curing , curdling , drying , pickling , fermenting , and smoking .
food manufacturing arose during the industrial revolution in the *ord* century .
this development took advantage of new mass markets and emerging technology , such as milling , preservation , packaging and labeling , and transportation .
it brought the advantages of pre-prepared time-saving food to the bulk of ordinary people who did not employ domestic servants .
at the start of the *ord* century , a two-tier structure has arisen , with a few international food processing giants controlling a wide range of well-known food brands .
there also exists a wide array of small local or national food processing companies .
advanced technologies have also come to change food manufacture .
computer-based control systems , sophisticated processing and packaging methods , and logistics and distribution advances can enhance product quality , improve food safety , and reduce costs .
the world bank reported that the european union was the top food importer in *num* , followed at a distance by the us and japan .
britain's need for food was especially well illustrated in world war ii .
despite the implementation of food rationing , britain remained dependent on food imports and the result was a long term engagement in the battle of the atlantic .
food is traded and marketed on a global basis .
the variety and availability of food is no longer restricted by the diversity of locally grown food or the limitations of the local growing season .
between *num* and *num* , there was a *num* % increase in worldwide food exports .
some countries are now economically dependent on food exports , which in some cases account for over *num* % of all exports .
in *num* , over *num* countries became signatories to the uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade in a dramatic increase in trade liberalization .
this included an agreement to reduce subsidies paid to farmers , underpinned by the wto enforcement of agricultural subsidy , tariffs , import quotas , and settlement of trade disputes that cannot be bilaterally resolved .
where trade barriers are raised on the disputed grounds of public health and safety , the wto refer the dispute to the codex alimentarius commission , which was founded in *num* by the united nations food and agriculture organization and the world health organization .
trade liberalization has greatly affected world food trade .
food marketing brings together the producer and the consumer .
the marketing of even a single food product can be a complicated process involving many producers and companies .
for example , fifty-six companies are involved in making one can of chicken noodle soup .
these businesses include not only chicken and vegetable processors but also the companies that transport the ingredients and those who print labels and manufacture cans .
the food marketing system is the largest direct and indirect non-government employer in the united states .
in the pre-modern era , the sale of surplus food took place once a week when farmers took their wares on market day into the local village marketplace .
here food was sold to grocers for sale in their local shops for purchase by local consumers .
with the onset of industrialization and the development of the food processing industry , a wider range of food could be sold and distributed in distant locations .
typically early grocery shops would be counter-based shops , in which purchasers told the shop-keeper what they wanted , so that the shop-keeper could get it for them .
in the *ord* century , supermarkets were born .
supermarkets brought with them a self service approach to shopping using shopping carts , and were able to offer quality food at lower cost through economies of scale and reduced staffing costs .
in the latter part of the *ord* century , this has been further revolutionized by the development of vast warehouse-sized , out-of-town supermarkets , selling a wide range of food from around the world .
unlike food processors , food retailing is a two-tier market in which a small number of very large companies control a large proportion of supermarkets .
the supermarket giants wield great purchasing power over farmers and processors , and strong influence over consumers .
nevertheless , less than *num* % of consumer spending on food goes to farmers , with larger percentages going to advertising , transportation , and intermediate corporations .
it is rare for price spikes to hit all major foods in most countries at once , but food prices suffered all-time peaks in *num* and *num* , posting a *num* % and *num* % deflated increase year-over-year , representing prices higher than any data collected .
in december *num* , *num* countries faced food crises , and *num* had imposed some sort of food-price controls .
in china , the price of pork jumped *num* % in *num* .
in the 1980s and 1990s , farm subsidies and support programs allowed major grain exporting countries to hold large surpluses , which could be tapped during food shortages to keep prices down .
however , new trade policies had made agricultural production much more responsive to market demands , putting global food reserves at their lowest since *num* .
rising food prices in those years have been linked with social unrest around the world , including rioting in bangladesh and mexico , and the arab spring .
food prices worldwide increased in *num* .
one cause of rising food prices is wealthier asian consumers are westernizing their diets , and farmers and nations of the third world are struggling to keep up the pace .
the past five years have seen rapid growth in the contribution of asian nations to the global fluid and powdered milk manufacturing industry , which in *num* accounted for more than *num* % of production , while china alone accounts for more than *num* % of both production and consumption in the global fruit and vegetable processing and preserving industry .
in *num* overseas development institute researchers showed that rice has more than doubled in price since *num* , rising by *num* % in real terms .
this was as a result of shifts in trade policy and restocking by major producers .
more fundamental drivers of increased prices are the higher costs of fertiliser , diesel and labour .
parts of asia see rural wages rise with potential large benefits for the *num* .
*num* billion ( *num* estimate ) of asia's poor in reducing the poverty they face .
however , this negatively impacts more vulnerable groups who don't share in the economic boom , especially in asian and african coastal cities .
the researchers said the threat means social-protection policies are needed to guard against price shocks .
the research proposed that in the longer run , the rises present opportunities to export for western african farmers with high potential for rice production to replace imports with domestic production .
most recently , global food prices have been more stable and relatively low , after a sizable increase in late *num* , they are back under *num* % of the nominal value seen during the all-time high in the *num* food crisis .
institutions such as hedge funds , pension funds and investment banks like barclays capital , goldman sachs and morgan stanley have been instrumental in pushing up prices in the last five years , with investment in food commodities rising from $65bn to $126bn ( £41bn to £79bn ) between *num* and *num* , contributing to 30-year highs .
this has caused price fluctuations which are not strongly related to the actual supply of food , according to the united nations .
financial institutions now make up *num* % of all investment in wheat futures .
according to olivier de schutter , the un special rapporteur on food , there was a rush by institutions to enter the food market following george w bush's commodities futures modernization act of *num* .
de schutter told the independent in march *num* : " what we are seeing now is that these financial markets have developed massively with the arrival of these new financial investors , who are purely interested in the short-term monetary gain and are not really interested in the physical thing – they never actually buy the ton of wheat or maize ; they only buy a promise to buy or to sell .
the result of this financialisation of the commodities market is that the prices of the products respond increasingly to a purely speculative logic .
this explains why in very short periods of time we see prices spiking or bubbles exploding , because prices are less and less determined by the real match between supply and demand .
" in *num* , *num* economists from around the world called on the g20 to regulate the commodities market more .
some experts have said that speculation has merely aggravated other factors , such as climate change , competition with bio-fuels and overall rising demand .
however , some such as jayati ghosh , professor of economics at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi , have pointed out that prices have increased irrespective of supply and demand issues : ghosh points to world wheat prices , which doubled in the period from june to december *num* , despite there being no fall in global supply .
food deprivation leads to malnutrition and ultimately starvation .
this is often connected with famine , which involves the absence of food in entire communities .
this can have a devastating and widespread effect on human health and mortality .
rationing is sometimes used to distribute food in times of shortage , most notably during times of war .
starvation is a significant international problem .
approximately *num* million people are undernourished , and over *num* , *num* children die per day from hunger-related causes .
food deprivation is regarded as a deficit need in maslow's hierarchy of needs and is measured using famine scales .
food aid can benefit people suffering from a shortage of food .
it can be used to improve peoples ' lives in the short term , so that a society can increase its standard of living to the point that food aid is no longer required .
conversely , badly managed food aid can create problems by disrupting local markets , depressing crop prices , and discouraging food production .
sometimes a cycle of food aid dependence can develop .
its provision , or threatened withdrawal , is sometimes used as a political tool to influence the policies of the destination country , a strategy known as food politics .
sometimes , food aid provisions will require certain types of food be purchased from certain sellers , and food aid can be misused to enhance the markets of donor countries .
international efforts to distribute food to the neediest countries are often coordinated by the world food programme .
foodborne illness , commonly called " food poisoning " , is caused by bacteria , toxins , viruses , parasites , and prions .
roughly *num* million people die of food poisoning each year , with about *num* times as many suffering from a non-fatal version .
the two most common factors leading to cases of bacterial foodborne illness are cross-contamination of ready-to-eat food from other uncooked foods and improper temperature control .
less commonly , acute adverse reactions can also occur if chemical contamination of food occurs , for example from improper storage , or use of non-food grade soaps and disinfectants .
food can also be adulterated by a very wide range of articles ( known as " foreign bodies " ) during farming , manufacture , cooking , packaging , distribution , or sale .
these foreign bodies can include pests or their droppings , hairs , cigarette butts , wood chips , and all manner of other contaminants .
it is possible for certain types of food to become contaminated if stored or presented in an unsafe container , such as a ceramic pot with lead-based glaze .
food poisoning has been recognized as a disease since as early as hippocrates .
the sale of rancid , contaminated , or adulterated food was commonplace until the introduction of hygiene , refrigeration , and vermin controls in the *ord* century .
discovery of techniques for killing bacteria using heat , and other microbiological studies by scientists such as louis pasteur , contributed to the modern sanitation standards that are ubiquitous in developed nations today .
this was further underpinned by the work of justus von liebig , which led to the development of modern food storage and food preservation methods .
in more recent years , a greater understanding of the causes of food-borne illnesses has led to the development of more systematic approaches such as the hazard analysis and critical control points ( haccp ) , which can identify and eliminate many risks .
recommended measures for ensuring food safety include maintaining a clean preparation area with foods of different types kept separate , ensuring an adequate cooking temperature , and refrigerating foods promptly after cooking .
foods that spoil easily , such as meats , dairy , and seafood , must be prepared a certain way to avoid contaminating the people for whom they are prepared .
as such , the rule of thumb is that cold foods ( such as dairy products ) should be kept cold and hot foods ( such as soup ) should be kept hot until storage .
cold meats , such as chicken , that are to be cooked should not be placed at room temperature for thawing , at the risk of dangerous bacterial growth , such as " salmonella " or " e .
coli " .
some people have allergies or sensitivities to foods which are not problematic to most people .
this occurs when a person's immune system mistakes a certain food protein for a harmful foreign agent and attacks it .
about *num* % of adults and *num* % of children have a food allergy .
the amount of the food substance required to provoke a reaction in a particularly susceptible individual can be quite small .
in some instances , traces of food in the air , too minute to be perceived through smell , have been known to provoke lethal reactions in extremely sensitive individuals .
common food allergens are gluten , corn , shellfish ( mollusks ) , peanuts , and soy .
allergens frequently produce symptoms such as diarrhea , rashes , bloating , vomiting , and regurgitation .
the digestive complaints usually develop within half an hour of ingesting the allergen .
rarely , food allergies can lead to a medical emergency , such as anaphylactic shock , hypotension ( low blood pressure ) , and loss of consciousness .
an allergen associated with this type of reaction is peanut , although latex products can induce similar reactions .
initial treatment is with epinephrine ( adrenaline ) , often carried by known patients in the form of an epi-pen or twinject .
human diet was estimated to cause perhaps around *num* % of cancers in a human epidemiological analysis by richard doll and richard peto in *num* .
these cancer may be caused by carcinogens that are present in food naturally or as contaminants .
food contaminated with fungal growth may contain mycotoxins such as aflatoxins which may be found in contaminated corn and peanuts .
other carcinogens identified in food include heterocyclic amines generated in meat when cooked at high temperature , polyaromatic hydrocarbons in charred meat and smoked fish , and nitrosamines generated from nitrites used as food preservatives in cured meat such as bacon .
anticarcinogens that may help prevent cancer can also be found in many food especially fruit and vegetables .
antioxidants are important groups of compounds that may help remove potentially harmful chemicals .
it is however often difficult to identify the specific components in diet that serve to increase or decrease cancer risk since many food , such as beef steak and broccoli , contain low concentrations of both carcinogens and anticarcinogens .
there are many international certifications in cooking field , such as monde selection、a .
a .
certification、itqi .
they use the high quality evaluation methods to make the food become more safe .
many cultures hold some food preferences and some food taboos .
dietary choices can also define cultures and play a role in religion .
for example , only kosher foods are permitted by judaism , halal foods by islam , and in hinduism beef is restricted .
in addition , the dietary choices of different countries or regions have different characteristics .
this is highly related to a culture's cuisine .
dietary habits play a significant role in the health and mortality of all humans .
imbalances between the consumed fuels and expended energy results in either starvation or excessive reserves of adipose tissue , known as body fat .
poor intake of various vitamins and minerals can lead to diseases that can have far-reaching effects on health .
for instance , *num* % of the world's population either has , or is at risk for developing , iodine deficiency .
it is estimated that at least *num* million children are blind due to vitamin a deficiency .
vitamin c deficiency results in scurvy .
calcium , vitamin d , and phosphorus are inter-related ; the consumption of each may affect the absorption of the others .
kwashiorkor and marasmus are childhood disorders caused by lack of dietary protein .
many individuals limit what foods they eat for reasons of morality , or other habit .
for instance , vegetarians choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees .
others choose a healthier diet , avoiding sugars or animal fats and increasing consumption of dietary fiber and antioxidants .
obesity , a serious problem in the western world , leads to higher chances of developing heart disease , diabetes , cancer and many other diseases .
more recently , dietary habits have been influenced by the concerns that some people have about possible impacts on health or the environment from genetically modified food .
further concerns about the impact of industrial farming ( grains ) on animal welfare , human health , and the environment are also having an effect on contemporary human dietary habits .
this has led to the emergence of a movement with a preference for organic and local food .
between the extremes of optimal health and death from starvation or malnutrition , there is an array of disease states that can be caused or alleviated by changes in diet .
deficiencies , excesses , and imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health , which may lead to various health problems such as scurvy , obesity , or osteoporosis , diabetes , cardiovascular diseases as well as psychological and behavioral problems .
the science of nutrition attempts to understand how and why specific dietary aspects influence health .
nutrients in food are grouped into several categories .
macronutrients are fat , protein , and carbohydrates .
micronutrients are the minerals and vitamins .
additionally , food contains water and dietary fiber .
as previously discussed , the body is designed by natural selection to enjoy sweet and fattening foods for evolutionary diets , ideal for hunters and gatherers .
thus , sweet and fattening foods in nature are typically rare and are very pleasurable to eat .
in modern times , with advanced technology , enjoyable foods are easily available to consumers .
unfortunately , this promotes obesity in adults and children alike .
some countries list a legal definition of food , often referring them with the word " foodstuff " .
these countries list food as any item that is to be processed , partially processed , or unprocessed for consumption .
the listing of items included as food include any substance intended to be , or reasonably expected to be , ingested by humans .
in addition to these foodstuffs , drink , chewing gum , water , or other items processed into said food items are part of the legal definition of food .
items not included in the legal definition of food include animal feed , live animals ( unless being prepared for sale in a market ) , plants prior to harvesting , medicinal products , cosmetics , tobacco and tobacco products , narcotic or psychotropic substances , and residues and contaminants .
actinopterygii actinopterygii ( ) , or the ray-finned fishes , constitute a class or subclass of the bony fishes .
the ray-finned fishes are so called because their fins are webs of skin supported by bony or horny spines ( " rays " ) , as opposed to the fleshy , lobed fins that characterize the class sarcopterygii ( lobe-finned fish ) .
these actinopterygian fin rays attach directly to the proximal or basal skeletal elements , the radials , which represent the link or connection between these fins and the internal skeleton ( e .
g .
, pelvic and pectoral girdles ) .
numerically , actinopterygians are the dominant class of vertebrates , comprising nearly *num* % of the over *num* , *num* species of fish .
they are ubiquitous throughout freshwater and marine environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain streams .
extant species can range in size from " paedocypris " , at , to the massive ocean sunfish , at , and the long-bodied oarfish , at .
ray-finned fishes occur in many variant forms .
the main features of a typical ray-finned fish are shown in the adjacent diagram .
in nearly all ray-finned fish , the sexes are separate , and in most species the females spawn eggs that are fertilized externally , typically with the male inseminating the eggs after they are laid .
development then proceeds with a free-swimming larval stage .
however other patterns of ontogeny exist , with one of the commonest being sequential hermaphroditism .
in most cases this involves protogyny , fish starting life as females and converting to males at some stage , triggered by some internal or external factor .
protandry , where a fish converts from male to female , is much less common than protogyny .
most families use external rather than internal fertilization .
of the oviparous teleosts , most ( *num* % ) do not provide parental care .
viviparity , ovoviviparity , or some form of parental care for eggs , whether by the male , the female , or both parents is seen in a significant fraction ( *num* % ) of the *num* teleost families ; no care is likely the ancestral condition .
viviparity is relatively rare and is found in about *num* % of teleost species ; male care is far more common than female care .
male territoriality " preadapts " a species for evolving male parental care .
there are a few examples of fish that self-fertilise .
the mangrove rivulus is an amphibious , simultaneous hermaphrodite , producing both eggs and spawn and having internal fertilisation .
this mode of reproduction may be related to the fish's habit of spending long periods out of water in the mangrove forests it inhabits .
males are occasionally produced at temperatures below and can fertilise eggs that are then spawned by the female .
this maintains genetic variability in a species that is otherwise highly inbred .
the earliest known fossil actinopterygiian is " andreolepis hedei " , dating back *num* million years ( late silurian ) .
remains have been found in russia , sweden , and estonia .
actinopterygians are divided into the subclasses chondrostei and neopterygii .
the neopterygii , in turn , are divided into the infraclasses holostei and teleostei .
during the mesozoic and cenozoic the teleosts in particular diversified widely , and as a result , *num* % of all known fish species are teleosts .
the cladogram shows the major groups of actinopterygians and their relationship to the terrestrial vertebrates ( tetrapods ) that evolved from a related group of fish .
approximate dates are from near et al .
, *num* .
the polypterids ( bichirs and ropefish ) are the sister lineage of all other actinopterygians , the acipenseriformes ( sturgeons and paddlefishes ) are the sister lineage of neopterygii , and holostei ( bowfin and gars ) are the sister lineage of teleosts .
the elopomorpha ( eels and tarpons ) appears to be the most basic teleosts .
the listing below follows phylogenetic classification of bony fishes with notes when this differs from nelson , itis and fishbase and extinct groups from van der laan *num* .
books of samuel the books of samuel , *num* samuel and *num* samuel , form part of the narrative history of israel in the nevi'im or " prophets " section of the hebrew bible / old testament , called the deuteronomistic history , a series of books ( joshua , judges , samuel and kings ) that constitute a theological history of the israelites and aim to explain god's law for israel under the guidance of the prophets .
according to jewish tradition , the book was written by samuel , with additions by the prophets gad and nathan .
modern scholarly thinking is that the entire deuteronomistic history was composed in the period c .
630–540 bc by combining a number of independent texts of various ages .
samuel begins with the prophet samuel's birth and god's call to him as a boy .
the story of the ark of the covenant that follows tells of israel's oppression by the philistines , which brought about samuel's anointing of saul as israel's first king .
but saul proved unworthy and god's choice turned to david , who defeated israel's enemies and brought the ark to jerusalem .
god then promised david and his successors an everlasting dynasty .
the childless hannah vows to yahweh of hosts that if she has a son , he will be dedicated to him .
eli , the priest of shiloh ( where the ark of the covenant is located ) , blesses her , and a child named samuel is born .
samuel is dedicated to the lord as a nazirite – the only one besides samson to be identified in the bible .
eli's sons , hophni and phinehas , prove unworthy of the priesthood and are killed in battle during the battle of aphek , but the child samuel grows up " in the presence of the lord .
" the philistines capture the ark of the covenant from shiloh and take it to the temple of their god dagon , who recognizes the supremacy of yahweh .
the philistines are afflicted with plagues and return the ark to the israelites , but to the territory of the tribe of benjamin rather than to shiloh .
the philistines attack the israelites gathered at mizpah in benjamin .
samuel appeals to yahweh , the philistines are decisively beaten , and the israelites reclaim their lost territory .
in samuel's old age , he appoints his sons joel and abijah as judges , but they are unworthy , and so the people clamor for a king .
god directs samuel to grant them a king despite his concerns and gives them saul of the tribe of benjamin .
saul defeats the enemies of the israelites , but sins against yahweh .
yahweh tells samuel to anoint david of bethlehem as king , and david enters saul's court as his armor-bearer and harpist .
saul's son and heir jonathan befriends david and recognizes him as the rightful king .
saul plots david's death , but david flees into the wilderness , where he becomes a champion of the hebrews .
david joins the philistines but continues secretly to champion his own people , until saul and jonathan are killed in battle at mount gilboa .
at this point , david offers a majestic eulogy , where he praises the bravery and magnificence of both his friend jonathan and king saul .
the elders of judah anoint david as king , but in the north saul's son ish-bosheth , or ishbaal , rules over the northern tribes .
after a long war , ishbaal is murdered by rechab and baanah , two of his captains who hope for a reward from david ; but david has them killed for killing god's anointed .
david is then anointed king of all israel .
david captures jerusalem and brings the ark there .
david wishes to build a temple , but nathan tells him that one of his sons will be the one to build the temple .
david defeats the enemies of israel , slaughtering philistines , moabites , edomites , syrians and arameans .
david commits adultery with bathsheba , who becomes pregnant .
when her husband , uriah the hittite returns from battle , david encourages him to go home and see his wife but uriah declines in case david might need him .
david thus deliberately sends uriah on a suicide mission ; and for this , yahweh sends disasters against his house .
nathan tells david that the sword shall never depart from his house .
for the remainder of his reign there are problems .
amnon ( one of david's sons ) rapes his half-sister tamar ( one of david's daughters ) .
absalom ( another son of david ) kills amnon , rebels against his father , and david flees from jerusalem .
absalom is killed following the battle of the wood of ephraim , david is restored as king , and he returns to his palace .
finally only two contenders for the succession remain , adonijah , son of david and haggith , and solomon , son of david and bathsheba .
the second book of samuel concludes with four chapters ( chapters *num* to *num* ) which lie outside the chronological narrative of saul and david .
the narrative is resumed with the first book of kings , which relates how , as david lies dying , bathsheba and nathan ensure solomon's elevation to the throne .
the four supplementary chapters cover a great famine during david's reign , the execution of seven of saul's remaining descendants , only mephibosheth being saved , david's song of thanksgiving , which is almost identical to psalm *num* , his last words , a list of david's " mighty warriors " , an offering made by david using water from the well of bethlehem , david's sinful census , a plague over israel which david opted for as preferable to either famine or oppression , and the construction of an altar on land he purchased from araunah the jebusite .
what it is now commonly known as *num* samuel and *num* samuel are called by the vulgate , in imitation of the septuagint , *num* kings and *num* kings respectively .
then , what it is now commonly known as *num* kings and *num* kings would be *num* kings and *num* kings in old bibles before the year *num* .
it was in *num* that use of the division we know now today used by protestant bibles and adopted by catholics began .
some bibles still preserve the old denomination , for example , the douay-rheims bible .
*num* and *num* samuel were originally ( and , in some jewish bibles , still are ) a single book , but the first greek translation , called septuagint and produced around the second century bc , divided it into two ; this was adopted by the latin translations used in the early christian church of the west , and finally introduced into jewish bibles around the early *ord* century .
the hebrew text , that is used by jews today , called the masoretic text , differs considerably from the hebrew text that was the basis of the first greek translation , and scholars are still working at finding the best solutions to the many problems this presents .
according to passages 14b and 15a of the bava basra tractate of the talmud , the book was written by samuel up until *num* samuel *num* , which notes the death of samuel , and the remainder by the prophets gad and nathan .
critical scholars from the *ord* century onward have rejected this idea .
martin noth in *num* theorized that samuel was composed by a single author as part of a history of israel : the deuteronomistic history ( made up of deuteronomy , joshua , judges , samuel and kings ) .
although noth's belief that the entire history was composed by a single individual has been largely abandoned , his theory in its broad outline has been adopted by most scholars .
the most common view today is that an early version of the history was composed in the time of king hezekiah ( *ord* century bc ) ; the bulk of the first edition dates from his grandson josiah at the end of the *ord* bc , with further sections added during the babylonian exile ( *ord* century bc ) and the work was substantially complete by about *num* bc .
further editing was apparently done even after then : for example , the silver quarter-shekel which saul's servant offers to samuel in *num* samuel *num* almost certainly fixes the date of this story in the persian or hellenistic periods .
the *ord* century bc authors and editors responsible for the bulk of the history drew on many earlier sources , including ( but not limited to ) an " ark narrative " ( *num* samuel *num* : 1–7 : *num* and perhaps part of *num* samuel *num* ) , a " saul cycle " ( parts of *num* samuel 9–11 and 13–14 ) , the " history of david's rise " ( *num* samuel *num* : 14-2 samuel *num* : *num* ) , and the " succession narrative " ( *num* samuel 9–20 and *num* kings 1–2 ) .
the oldest of these , the " ark narrative , " may even predate the davidic era .
the sources used to construct *num* and *num* samuel are believed to include the following : the book of samuel is a theological evaluation of kingship in general and of dynastic kingship and david in particular .
the main themes of the book are introduced in the opening poem ( the " song of hannah " ) : ( *num* ) the sovereignty of yahweh , god of israel ; ( *num* ) the reversal of human fortunes ; and ( *num* ) kingship .
these themes are played out in the stories of the three main characters , samuel , saul and david .
samuel answers the description of the " prophet like moses " predicted in deuteronomy *num* : 15–22 : like moses , he has direct contact with yahweh , acts as a judge , and is a perfect leader who never makes mistakes .
samuel's successful defense of the israelites against their enemies demonstrates that they have no need for a king ( who will , moreover , introduce inequality ) , yet despite this the people demand a king .
but the king they are given is yahweh's gift , and samuel explains that kingship can be a blessing rather than a curse if they remain faithful to their god .
on the other hand , total destruction of both king and people will result if they turn to wickedness .
saul is the chosen one , tall , handsome and " goodly " , a king appointed by yahweh , and anointed by samuel , yahweh's prophet , and yet he is ultimately rejected .
saul has two faults which make him unfit for the office of king : carrying out a sacrifice in place of samuel ( *num* samuel *num* : 8–14 ) , and failing to exterminate the amalekites , in accordance to god's commands , and trying to compensate by claiming that he reserved the surviving amalekite livestock for sacrifice ( *num* samuel *num* ) .
one of the main units within samuel is the " history of david's rise " , the purpose of which is to justify david as the legitimate successor to saul .
the narrative stresses that he gained the throne lawfully , always respecting " the lord's anointed " ( i .
e .
saul ) and never taking any of his numerous chances to seize the throne by violence .
as god's chosen king over israel , david is also the son of god ( " i will be a father to him , and he shall be a son to me .
.
.
" – *num* samuel *num* : *num* ) .
god enters into an eternal covenant ( treaty ) with david and his line , promising divine protection of the dynasty and of jerusalem through all time .
*num* samuel *num* contains a prophetic statement described as the " last words of david " ( verses 1-7 ) and details of the *num* " mighty men " who were david's chief warriors ( verses 8-38 ) .
the jerusalem bible states that last words were attributed to david in the style of jacob ( see jacob's blessing , genesis *num* ) and moses ( see blessing of moses , deuteronomy *num* ) .
its editors note that " the text has suffered considerably and reconstructions are conjectural " .
ansible an ansible is a category of fictional device or technology capable of near-instantaneous or superluminal communication .
it can send and receive messages to and from a corresponding device over any distance or obstacle whatsoever with no delay , even between star systems .
as a name for such a device , the word " ansible " first appeared in a *num* novel by ursula k .
le guin .
since that time , the term has been broadly used in the works of numerous science fiction authors , across a variety of settings and continuities .
ursula k .
le guin coined the word " ansible " in her *num* novel " rocannon's world " .
the word was a contraction of " answerable " , as the device would allow its users to receive answers to their messages in a reasonable amount of time , even over interstellar distances .
although le guin invented the name " ansible " for this type of device , fleshed out with specific details in her fictional works , the broader concept of instantaneous or faster-than-light communication had previously existed in science fiction .
for example , similar communication functions were included in a device called an interocitor in the *num* novel " this island earth " by raymond f .
jones , and the *num* film based on that novel , and in the " dirac communicator " , which first appeared in james blish's short story " beep " ( *num* ) , which was later expanded into the novel " the quincunx of time " ( *num* ) .
in her subsequent works , le guin continued to develop the concept of the ansible : any ansible may be used to communicate through any other , by setting its coordinates to those of the receiving ansible .
they have a limited bandwidth which only allows for at most a few hundred characters of text to be communicated in any transaction of a dialog session , and are attached to a keyboard and small display to perform text messaging .
since le guin's conception of the ansible , the name of the device has been borrowed by numerous authors .
while le guin's ansible was said to communicate " instantaneously " , the name has also been adopted for devices capable of communication at finite speeds that are faster than light .
orson scott card , in his *num* novelette and *num* novel " ender's game " and its sequels , used the term " ansible " for his own fictitious communication device .
in " ender's game " , a character stated that " somebody dredged the name " ansible " out of an old book somewhere .
" in the universe of the " ender's game " series , the ansible's functions involved a fictional subatomic particle , the philote .
the two quarks inside a pi meson can be separated by an arbitrary distance , while remaining connected by " philotic rays " .
this concept is similar to quantum teleportation due to entanglement ; however , in reality , quark confinement prevents quarks from being separated by any observable distance .
card's version of the ansible was also featured in the video game " advent rising " , for which card helped write the story , and in the movie " ender's game " , which was based on the book .
numerous other writers have included ansibles in their fictional works , using that word to refer to a faster-than-light communication device .
bass guitar the bass guitar ( also known as electric bass , or simply bass ) is a plucked string instrument similar in appearance and construction to an electric guitar , except with a longer neck and scale length , and four to six strings or courses .
the four-string bass is usually tuned the same as the double bass , which corresponds to pitches one octave lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of a guitar ( e , a , d , and g ) .
it is played primarily with the fingers or thumb , or striking with a pick .
the electric bass guitar has pickups and must be connected to an amplifier and speaker to be loud enough to compete with other instruments .
since the 1960s , the bass guitar has largely replaced the double bass in popular music as the bass instrument in the rhythm section .
while types of basslines vary widely from one style of music to another , the bassist usually plays a similar role : anchoring the harmonic framework and establishing the beat .
many styles of music include the bass guitar , and it is occasionally a soloing instrument .
according to the " new grove dictionary of music and musicians " , an " electric bass guitar [ is ] a guitar , usually with four heavy strings tuned e'-a'-d-g .
" it also defines " bass " as " bass ( iv ) .
a contraction of double bass or electric bass guitar .
" according to some authors the proper term is " electric bass " .
common names for the instrument are " bass guitar " , " electric bass guitar " , and " electric bass " and some authors claim that they are historically accurate .
the bass guitar is a transposing instrument , as it is notated in bass clef an octave higher than it sounds .
in the 1930s , musician and inventor paul tutmarc of seattle , washington , developed the first electric bass guitar in its modern form , a fretted instrument designed to be played horizontally .
the *num* sales catalog for tutmarc's electronic musical instrument company , audiovox , featured his " model *num* bass fiddle " , a four-stringed , solid-bodied , fretted electric bass guitar with a scale length , and a single pick up .
the adoption of a guitar's body shape made the instrument easier to hold and transport than any of the existing stringed bass instruments .
the addition of frets enabled bassists to play in tune more easily than on fretless acoustic or electric upright basses .
around *num* of these instruments were made during this period .
audiovox also sold their “model 236” bass amplifier .
around *num* , tutmarc's son , bud , began marketing a similar bass under the serenader brand name , prominently advertised in the nationally distributed l .
d .
heater music company wholesale jobber catalogue of *num* .
however , the tutmarc family inventions did not achieve market success .
in the 1950s , leo fender and george fullerton developed the first mass-produced electric bass guitar .
the fender electric instrument manufacturing company began producing the precision bass in october *num* .
the " p-bass " evolved from a simple , un-contoured " slab " body design and a single coil pickup similar to that of a telecaster , to something more like a fender stratocaster , with a contoured body design , edges beveled for comfort , and a split single coil pickup .
the " fender bass " was a revolutionary new instrument for gigging musicians .
in comparison with the large , heavy upright bass , which had been the main bass instrument in popular music from the early 1900s to the 1940s , the bass guitar could be easily transported to shows .
when amplified , the bass guitar was also less prone than acoustic basses to unwanted audio feedback .
in *num* monk montgomery became the first bassist to tour with the fender bass guitar , in lionel hampton's postwar big band .
montgomery was also possibly the first to record with the bass guitar , on july *num* , *num* with the art farmer septet .
roy johnson ( with lionel hampton ) , and shifty henry ( with louis jordan & his tympany five ) , were other early fender bass pioneers .
bill black , playing with elvis presley , switched from upright bass to the fender precision bass around *num* .
the bass guitar was intended to appeal to guitarists as well as upright bass players , and many early pioneers of the instrument , such as carol kaye , joe osborn , and paul mccartney were originally guitarists .
in *num* , following fender's lead , gibson released the first short-scale violin-shaped electric bass , with an extendable end pin so a bassist could play it upright or horizontally .
gibson renamed the bass the eb-1 in *num* .
also in *num* , gibson released the maple arched-top eb-2 described in the gibson catalogue as a " hollow-body electric bass that features a bass / baritone pushbutton for two different tonal characteristics " .
in *num* these were followed by the more conventional-looking eb-0 bass .
the eb-0 was very similar to a gibson sg in appearance ( although the earliest examples have a slab-sided body shape closer to that of the double-cutaway les paul special ) .
whereas fender basses had pickups mounted in positions in between the base of the neck and the top of the bridge , many of gibson's early basses featured one humbucking pickup mounted directly against the neck pocket .
the eb-3 , introduced in *num* , also had a " mini-humbucker " at the bridge position .
gibson basses tended to be smaller , sleeker instruments with a shorter scale length than the precision ; gibson did not produce a -scale bass until *num* with the release of the thunderbird , which was also the first gibson bass to use two humbucking pickups in a more traditional position , about halfway between the neck and bridge .
a number of other companies also began manufacturing bass guitars during the 1950s : kay in *num* , hofner and danelectro in *num* , rickenbacker in *num* and burns / supersound in *num* .
*num* saw the appearance at the german trade fair " musikmesse frankfurt " of the distinctive höfner *num* / *num* violin-shaped bass made using violin construction techniques by walter höfner , a second-generation violin luthier .
the design was eventually known popularly as the " beatle bass " , due to its endorsement and use by beatles bassist paul mccartney .
in *num* , rickenbacker introduced the model *num* , the first bass to feature a neck-through-body design in which the neck is part of the body wood .
the fender and gibson versions used bolt-on and glued-on necks .
with the explosion of the popularity of rock music in the 1960s , many more manufacturers began making electric basses , including yamaha , teisco and guyatone .
introduced in *num* , the fender jazz bass was first known as the " deluxe bass , " intended to accompany the jazzmaster guitar .
the " j-bass " featured two single-coil pickups , one close to the bridge and one in the precision bass's split coil pickup position .
the earliest production jazz basses had a " stacked " volume and tone control for each pickup ; this was soon changed to the familiar configuration of a volume control for each pickup , and a single passive tone control .
the jazz bass's neck was narrower at the nut than the precision bass — versus — allowing for easier access to the lower strings and an overall spacing and feel closer to that of an electric guitar , allowing trained guitarists to transition to the bass guitar more easily .
another visual difference that set the jazz bass apart from the precision is its " offset-waist " body .
pickup shapes on electric basses are often referred to as " p " or " j " pickups in reference to the visual and electrical differences between the precision bass and jazz bass pickups .
in the 1950s and 1960s , all bass guitars were often called the " fender bass " , due to fender's early dominance in the market .
providing a more " gibson-scale " instrument , rather than the jazz and precision , fender produced the mustang bass , a scale-length instrument .
the fender vi , a baritone guitar , was tuned one octave lower than standard guitar tuning .
it was released in *num* , and was briefly favored by jack bruce of cream .
gibson introduced its short-scale eb-3 in *num* , also used by jack bruce .
in *num* , alembic established what became known as " boutique " or " high-end " electric bass guitars .
these expensive , custom-tailored instruments , as used by phil lesh , jack casady , and stanley clarke , featured unique designs , premium hand-finished wood bodies , and innovative construction techniques such as multi-laminate neck-through-body construction and graphite necks .
alembic also pioneered the use of onboard electronics for pre-amplification and equalization .
active electronics increase the output of the instrument , and allow more options for controlling tonal flexibility , giving the player the ability to amplify as well as to attenuate certain frequency ranges while improving the overall frequency response ( including more low-register and high-register sounds ) .
*num* saw the uk company wal begin production of a their own range of active basses , and in *num* music man instruments , founded by tom walker , forrest white and leo fender , introduced the stingray , the first widely produced bass with active ( powered ) electronics built into the instrument .
basses with active electronics can include a preamplifier and knobs for boosting and cutting the low and high frequencies .
specific bass brands / models became identified with particular styles of music , such as the rickenbacker *num* series , which became identified with progressive rock bassists like chris squire of yes , and geddy lee of rush , while the stingray was used by funk / disco players such louis johnson of the funk band the brothers johnson and bernard edwards of chic .
the *num* stereo bass was introduced in the late 1960s ; it can be heard on the beatles ' " i am the walrus " .
in the mid-1970s , alembic and other high-end manufacturers , such as tobias , began offering five-string basses , with a very low " b " string .
in *num* , bassist anthony jackson commissioned luthier carl thompson to build a six-string bass tuned ( low to high ) b0 , e1 , a1 , d2 , g2 , c3 , adding a low b string and a high c string .
these five- and six-string " extended-range basses " would become popular with session bassists , reducing the need for re-tuning to alternate detuned configurations like " drop d " , and also allowing the bassist to play more notes from the same fretting position with fewer shifts up and down the fingerboard , a crucial benefit for a session player sightreading basslines at a recording session .
in the 1980s , bass designers continued to explore new approaches .
ned steinberger introduced a headless bass in *num* and continued his innovations in the 1980s , using graphite and other new materials and ( in *num* ) introducing the transtrem tremolo bar .
in *num* , hans-peter wilfer founded warwick , to make a european bass , as the market at the time was dominated by asian and american basses .
their first bass was the streamer bass , which is similar to the spector ns .
in *num* , the guild guitar corporation launched the fretless ashbory bass , which used silicone rubber strings and a piezoelectric pickup to achieve an " upright bass " sound with a short scale length .
in the late 1980s , mtv's " unplugged " show , which featured bands performing with acoustic instruments , helped to popularize hollow-bodied acoustic bass guitars amplified with piezoelectric pickups built into the bridge of the instrument .
during the 1990s , as five-string basses became more widely available and more affordable , an increasing number of bassists in genres ranging from metal to gospel began using five-string instruments for added lower range—a low " b " string .
as well , onboard battery-powered electronics such as preamplifiers and equalizer circuits , which were previously only available on expensive " boutique " instruments , became increasingly available on mid-priced basses .
from *num* to the 2010s , some bass manufacturers included digital modelling circuits inside the instrument on more costly instruments to recreate tones and sounds from many models of basses ( e .
g .
, line 6's variax bass ) .
a modelling bass can digitally emulate the tone and sound of many famous basses , ranging from a vintage fender precision to a rickenbacker .
however , as with the electric guitar , traditional " passive " bass designs , which include only pickups , tone and volume knobs ( without a preamp or other electronics ) remained popular .
reissued versions of vintage instruments such as the fender precision bass and fender jazz bass remained popular amongst new instrument buyers up to the 2010s .
in *num* , a *ord* anniversary p-bass was introduced by fender , along with the re-introduction of the short-scale fender jaguar bass .
bass bodies are typically made of wood , although other materials such as graphite ( for example , some of the steinberger designs ) and other lightweight composite materials have been used .
while a wide variety of woods are suitable for the body , neck , and fretboard , the most common woods used are those used for solid-body electric guitars : alder , ash or mahogany for the body , maple for the neck , and rosewood or ebony for the fretboard .
for tonal or aesthetic reasons , luthiers more commonly experiment with different woods on basses than with electric guitars , and less-common woods like walnut and figured maple , as well as exotic woods like bubinga , wenge , koa , and purpleheart , are often used as accent woods in the neck or on the face of mid- to high-priced production basses .
more expensive basses often feature exotic woods .
for example , alembic uses cocobolo as a body or top layer material because of its attractive grain .
warwick bass guitars are well known for exotic hardwoods , making most necks out of ovangkol , and fingerboards from wenge or ebony .
some makers use solid bubinga bodies for their tonal and aesthetic qualities .
other design options include finishes , such as lacquer , wax and oil ; flat and carved designs ; luthier-produced custom-designed instruments ; headless basses , which have tuning machines in the bridge of the instrument ( e .
g .
, steinberger and hohner designs ) and artificial materials such as luthite and ebonol .
the use of artificial materials allows for production techniques such as die-casting , to produce complex body shapes .
while most basses have solid bodies , they can also include hollow chambers to increase the resonance or reduce the weight of the instrument .
some basses are built with entirely hollow bodies , which change the tone and resonance of the instrument .
acoustic bass guitars have a hollow wooden body constructed similarly to an acoustic guitar , and are typically equipped with piezoelectric or magnetic pickups and amplified .
some makers have used graphite composite to make lightweight necks e .
g .
, status brand basses , which are made from graphite .
a common feature of more expensive basses is " neck-through " construction .
instead of milling the body from a single piece of wood ( or " bookmatched " halves ) and then attaching the neck into a pocket ( so-called " bolt-on " design ) , neck-through basses are constructed first by assembling the neck , which may comprise one , three , five or more layers of wood in vertical stripes , which are longer than the length of the fretboard .
to this elongated neck , the body is attached as two " wings , " which may also be made up of several layers .
the entire bass is then milled and shaped .
" neck-through " construction advertisements claim this approach provides better sustain and a mellower tone than " bolt-on " neck construction .
while neck-through construction is most common in handmade " boutique " basses , some models of mass-produced basses such as ibanez's btb series also have neck-through construction .
bolt-on neck construction does not necessarily imply a cheaply made instrument ; virtually all traditional fender designs still use bolt-on necks , including its high-end instruments costing thousands of dollars , and many boutique luthiers such as sadowsky build bolt-on basses as well as neck-through instruments .
the number of frets installed on a bass guitar neck may vary .
the original fender basses had *num* frets , and most bass guitars have between *num* and *num* frets or fret positions .
instruments with between *num* and *num* frets ( *num* and *num* octaves ) also exist .
instruments with more frets are used by bassists who play bass solos , as more frets gives them additional upper range notes .
when a bass has a large number of frets , such as a *num* fret instrument , the bass may have a deeper " cutaway " to enable the performer to reach the higher pitches .
like electric guitars , fretted basses typically have markers on the fingerboard and on the side of the neck to assist the player in determining where notes and important harmonic points are .
the markers indicate the *ord* , *ord* , *ord* , *ord* fret and *ord* fret ( the *ord* fret being the octave of the open string ) and on the octave-or-more equivalents of the *ord* fret and as many additional positions as an instrument has frets for .
typically , one marker is on the *ord* , *ord* , *ord* and *ord* fret positions and two markers on the *ord* fret .
the " long scale necks " on the first fender basses— — set the standard for electric basses , although " short scale " instruments , such as the höfner *num* / *num* " violin bass " played by paul mccartney , and the fender mustang bass are common .
short-scale instruments use the same e-a-d-g tuning as a regular long scale instrument .
while , , and scale lengths were once only available in " boutique " instruments , these " extra long " scale lengths became somewhat more common in the 2000s .
this extra-long scale provides a higher string tension , which may yield a more defined , deep tone on the low " b " string of five- and six-stringed instruments ( or detuned four-string basses ) .
another design consideration for the bass is whether to use frets on the fingerboard .
on a fretted bass , the metal frets divide the fingerboard into semitone divisions ( as on an electric guitar or acoustic guitar ) .
fretless basses have a distinct sound , because the absence of frets means that the string must be pressed down directly onto the wood of the fingerboard with the fingers , as with the double bass .
the string buzzes against the wood and is somewhat muted because the sounding portion of the string is in direct contact with the flesh of the player's finger .
the fretless bass lets players use expressive approaches such as glissando ( sliding up or down in pitch , with all of the pitches in between sounding ) , and vibrato ( in which the player rocks a finger that is stopping a string to oscillate the pitch slightly ) .
fretless players can also play microtones , or temperaments other than equal temperament , such as just intonation .
while fretless basses are often associated with jazz and jazz fusion , bassists from other genres have used fretless basses , such as freebo ( country ) , rick danko ( rock / blues ) , rod clements ( folk ) , steve digiorgio , jeroen paul thesseling ( metal ) , tony franklin ( rock ) , colin edwin ( progressive rock ) , and mick karn ( new wave ) .
some bassists alternate between fretted and fretless basses in performances , according to the type of material or tunes they are performing , e .
g .
, pino palladino or tony levin .
the first known fretless bass guitar was made by bill wyman in *num* when he converted a used uk-built ‘dallas tuxedo’ bass by removing the frets and filling in the slots with wood putty .
wyman's early fretless bass can be heard on the rolling stones songs such as " paint it , black " and " mother's little helper " from *num* .
he is seen recording with the instrument in the *num* film " one plus one " a .
k .
a .
" sympathy for the devil " .
the first production fretless bass was the ampeg aub-1 introduced in *num* , and fender introduced a fretless precision bass in *num* .
around *num* , rick danko from the band began to use an ampeg fretless , which he modified with fender pickups—as heard on the *num* " cahoots " studio album and the " rock of ages " album recorded live in *num* .
danko said , " it's a challenge to play fretless because you have to really use your ear .
" in the early 1970s , fusion-jazz bassist jaco pastorius coated the fingerboard of his de-fretted fender jazz bass in epoxy resin , allowing him to use roundwound strings for a brighter sound .
pastorius used epoxy rather than varnish to obtain a glass-like finish suitable for the use of roundwound strings , which are otherwise much harder on the wood of the fingerboard .
some fretless basses have " fret line " markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide , while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck .
tapewound ( double bass type ) and flatwound strings are sometimes used with the fretless bass so the metal string windings do not wear down the fingerboard .
tapewound and flatwound strings have a distinctive tone and sound .
some fretless basses have epoxy-coated fingerboards , or fingerboards made of an epoxy composite like micarta , to increase the fingerboard's durability , enhance sustain , and give a brighter tone .
the standard design for the electric bass guitar has four strings , tuned e , a , d and g , in fourths such that the open highest string , g , is an eleventh ( an octave and a fourth ) below middle c , making the tuning of all four strings the same as that of the double bass ( e–a–d–g ) .
this tuning is also the same as the standard tuning on the lower-pitched four strings on a six-string guitar , only an octave lower .
there is a range of different string types , which are available in many various metals , windings , and finishes .
each combination has specific tonal characteristics , interaction with pickups , and " feel " to the player's hands .
variables include wrap finish ( roundwound , flatwound , halfwound , ground wound , and pressure wound ) , as well as metal strings with different coverings ( tapewound or plastic covered ) .
in the 1950s and early 1960s , bassists mostly used flatwound strings with a smooth surface , which have a smooth , damped sound reminiscent of a double bass .
in the late 1960s and 1970s , players began using roundwound bass strings , which produce a brighter tone similar to steel guitar strings , snd a brighter timbre ( tone ) with longer sustain than flatwounds .
a variety of tuning options and number of string courses ( courses are when strings are put together in groups of two , often at the unison or octave ) have been used to extend the range of the instrument , or facilitate different modes of playing , or allow for different playing sounds .
some bassists use unusual tunings to extend the range or get other benefits , such as providing multiple octaves of notes at any given position , or a larger tonal range .
instrument types or tunings used for this purpose include basses with fewer than four strings ( one-string bass guitars ( japanese manufacturer atlansia offers one- , two- and three-stringed instruments ) , two-string bass guitars , three-string bass guitars [ tuned to e–a–d ] ) ( session bassist tony levin commissioned music man to build a three-string version of his favorite stingray bass ) and alternative tunings ( e .
g .
, tenor bass ) .
tuned a–d–g–c , like the top *num* strings of a six-string bass , or simply a standard four-string with the strings each tuned up an additional perfect fourth .
tenor bass is a tuning used by stanley clarke , victor wooten , and stu hamm .
extended-range basses ( erbs ) are basses with six to twelve strings—with the additional strings used for range rather than unison or octave pairs .
a seven-string bass ( b–e–a–d–g–c–f ) was built by luthier michael tobias in *num* for bassist garry goodman .
in *num* , south american bassist igor saavedra designed one of the first eight-string erbs , and asked luthier alfonso iturra to build it for him .
conklin builds custom erb basses .
these have a low f string below the b string , and the nine-string bass adds a low f and a high b string .
the guitarbass is a ten-string instrument with four bass strings ( tuned e–a–d–g ) and six guitar strings ( tuned e–a–d–g–b–e ) .
the guitarbass has *num* strings on the same neck and body , but with separate scale lengths , bridges , fretboards , and pickups .
it was created by john woolley in *num* , based on a prototype built by david minnieweather .
luthier michael adler built the first eleven-string bass in *num* and completed the first single-course 12-string bass in *num* .
adler's 11- and 12-string instruments have the same range as a grand piano .
the adler twelve-string has the same range as the bösendorfer *num* grand piano with *num* notes .
this was made possible by goodman developing an a string for the scale .
subcontrabasses , such as c–f–b–e ( the lowest string , c being at *num* .
*num* hz at around the limit of human hearing ) ( ( e .
g .
, the jauqo iii-x from *num* or the subbass guitar , e–a–d–g one octave below standard ( e being at *num* .
*num* hz ) ) have been created .
ibanez had released sr7viisc in *num* , featuring a scale and narrower width , and tuned as b–e–a–d–g–c–e ; the company dubbed it a cross between bass and guitar .
since *num* , german bass luthier warwick built several fretless thumb nt *num* basses for jeroen paul thesseling , featuring a scale with subcontra tuning f–b–e–a–d–g–c .
yves carbonne developed ten- and twelve-string fretless subbass guitars .
these extended range subbasses , legend x yc and legend xii yc , were built by luthier from barcelona .
the twelve-string legend xii yc uses a new b string tuned at b ( *num* .
*num* hz ) .
in *num* , a *num* string bass tuned ab–gb–db–b–e–a–d–g–c–f–bb–eb–ab was built by prometeus guitars giving the fullest range to a string instrument allowable by current string technology .
a piccolo bass resembles a four-stringed electric bass guitar , but usually tuned one full octave higher than a normal bass .
the first piccolo bass was constructed by luthier carl thompson for stanley clarke .
to allow for the raised tuning , the strings are thinner , and the length of the neck ( the scale ) may be shorter .
several companies manufacture " piccolo " string sets that , with a different nut , can be put on any regular bass .
joey demaio ( manowar ) plays with four strings on his piccolo bass .
jazz bassist john patitucci used a six-string piccolo bass , unaccompanied , on his song " sachi's eyes " on his album " one more angel " .
michael manring has used a five-string piccolo bass in several altered tunings .
michael uses d'addario exl *num* piccolo bass strings on his four-string hyperbass , made by zon guitars .
a multi-scale fingerboard for guitars and bass guitars has the lower-pitched strings longer than the higher-pitched strings , with the frets set radially rather than parallel .
some players find that these " fanned " frets are more ergonomic , easier and more comfortable to play , lining up more naturally with the fretting hand as the player's shoulder rotates .
other bassists believe that it evens out the tension across all of the strings , it evens the timbre across the strings , and extending the lower strings allows the string to produce harmonics that are closer to the fundamental .
.
torzal natural twist is a bass guitar body and neck style invented by luthier jerome little from amherst , massachusetts .
it consists of a neck rotated by a total of *num* degrees , with ( + ) *num* degrees at the bridge and ( - ) *num* at the nut .
the designer claims that the ergonomic design increases efficiency of the hands , wrists and arms , which reduces the risk of developing repetitive strain injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome or tendonitis .
this design is also beneficial to players who have already suffered from such injuries .
this patented design differs from traditional bass guitar design by twisting the neck , and bringing the strings toward a more natural hand position at either end of the instrument .
the rotation at either side of the instrument in the direction of the hand creates a neck plane that models the natural motion of the hand as it reaches outward .
the fretboard also forms a straight line at the location of each string , which should improve the ease of performance .
a lot of electric bass guitars use magnetic pickups .
the vibrations of the instrument's ferrous metal strings within the magnetic field of the permanent magnets in magnetic pickups produce small variations in the magnetic flux threading the coils of the pickups .
this in turn produces small electrical voltages in the coils .
many bass players connect the signal from the bass guitar's pickups to a bass amplifier and loudspeaker using a *num* / *num* " patch cord .
these low-level signals are then strengthened by the bass amp's preamplifier electronic circuits , and then amplified with the bass amp's power amplifier and played through one or more speaker ( s ) in a cabinet .
most basses have a volume potentiometer ( " pot " or " knob " ) , and a tone potentiometer that reduces ( attenuates ) the higher frequencies as it is turned .
basses with more than one pickup may have a selector switch or a " blend " potentiometer .
since the 1980s , basses are often available with battery-powered " active " electronics that boost the signal with a preamplifier and provide equalization controls to boost or cut bass and treble frequencies , or both .
some expensive basses have even more equalization options , such as bass , middle and treble .
many basses have just one pickup , typically a " p " or " mm " pickup , though single soapbars are not unheard of .
multiple pickups are also quite common , two of the most common configurations being two " j " pickups ( as on the stock fender jazz ) , or a " p " near the neck and a " j " near the bridge ( e .
g .
, fender precision bass special , fender precision bass plus ) .
a two-"soapbar " configuration is also very common , especially on basses by makes such as ibanez and yamaha .
a combination of a j or other single-coil pickup at the neck and a music man-style humbucker in the bridge has become popular among boutique instrument builders , giving a very bright , focused tone that is good for jazz , funk and thumbstyle .
some basses , particularly expensive boutique instruments or custom-made guitars , use more unusual pickup configurations .
examples include a soapbar and a " p " pickup ( found on some fender basses ) , bassist stu hamm's " urge " basses , which have a " p " pickup sandwiched between two " j " pickups , and some of funk bassist bootsy collins ' custom basses , which had as many as five j pickups .
another unusual pickup configuration is found on some of the custom basses that virtuoso bassist billy sheehan uses , in which there is one humbucker at the neck and a split-coil pickup at the middle position .
the placement of the pickup greatly affects the sound , timbre and tone of the instrument .
a pickup near the neck joint emphasizes the fundamental and low-order harmonics and thus produces a deeper , bassier sound , while a pickup near the bridge emphasizes higher-order harmonics and makes a " tighter " or " sharper " sound .
usually basses with multiple pickups allow blending of the output from the pickups , with electrical and acoustical interactions between the two pickups ( such as partial phase cancellations ) allowing a range of tonal and timbral effects .
the use of non-magnetic pickups allows bassists to use non-ferrous strings such as nylon , brass , polyurethane and silicone rubber .
these materials produce different tones and , in the case of the polyurethane or silicone rubber strings , allow much shorter scale lengths .
like the electric guitar , the electric bass guitar is almost always connected to an amplifier and a speaker with a patch cord for live performances .
electric bassists use either a " combo " amplifier , which combines an amplifier and a speaker in a single cabinet , or an amplifier and one or more speaker cabinets ( typically stacked , with the amplifier sitting on the speaker cabinets , leading to the term " half-stack " for one cabinet setups and " full stack " for two ) .
in most genres , a " clean " bass tone ( without any amplifier-induced " overdrive " or " distortion " ) is desirable , and so while guitarists often prefer the more desirable distorted tones of tube-transistor amplifiers , bassists commonly use solid-state amplifier circuitry to achieve the necessary high output wattages with less weight than tubes ( though smaller tubes can often still be found in the low-power " preamplifier " sections of the system , where they provide a warmer , smoother character to the bass tone for relatively little additional weight ) .
a few all-tube bass amplifiers are still available , notably from the ampeg brand .
in some cases , to play the bass through pa amplification , it is plugged into a " direct box " or " di " , which routes the signal to the bass amp while also sending the signal directly into a mixing console , and thence to the main and monitor speakers .
when a recording of bass is being made , engineers may use a microphone set up in front of the amplifier's speaker cabinet for the amplified signal , a direct box signal that feeds the recording console , or a mix of both .
various electronic bass effects such as preamplifiers , " stomp box"-style pedals and signal processors and the configuration of the amplifier and speaker can be used to alter the basic sound of the instrument .
in the 1990s and early 2000s ( decade ) , signal processors such as equalizers , overdrive devices ( sometimes referred to as " fuzz bass " ( the beatles ' *num* album " rubber soul " uses the term " fuzz bass " ) ) , and compressors or limiters became increasingly popular .
modulation effects like chorus , flanging , phase shifting , and time effects such as delay and looping are less commonly used with bass than with electric guitar , but they are used in some styles of music .
in contrast to the upright bass ( " double bass " ) , the electric bass guitar is played horizontally across the body , like a guitar .
when the strings are plucked with the fingers ( pizzicato ) , the index and middle fingers ( and sometimes the thumb , ring , and little fingers as well ) are used .
james jamerson , an influential bassist from the motown era , played intricate bass lines using only his index finger , which he called " the hook " .
there are also variations in how a bassist chooses to rest the right-hand thumb ( or left thumb in the case of left-handed players ) .
a player may rest his or her thumb on the top edge of one of the pickups or on the side of the fretboard , which is especially common among bassists who have an upright bass influence .
some bassists anchor their thumbs on the lowest string and move it off the lowest string when they need to play on the low string .
alternatively , the thumb can be rested loosely on the strings to mute the unused strings .
the string can be plucked ( or picked ) at any point between the bridge and the point where the fretting hand is holding down the string on the fingerboard ; different timbres ( tones ) are produced depending on where along the string it is plucked .
when plucked closer to the bridge , the string's harmonics are more pronounced , giving a brighter tone .
closer to the middle of the string , these harmonics are less pronounced , giving a more mellow , darker tone .
bassists trying to emulate the sound of a double bass sometimes pluck the strings with their thumb and use palm-muting to create a short , " thumpy " tone .
monk montgomery ( who played in lionel hampton's big band ) and bruce palmer ( who performed with buffalo springfield ) use thumb downstrokes .
the use of the thumb was acknowledged by early fender models , which came with a " thumbrest " or " tug bar " attached to the pickguard below the strings .
contrary to its name , this was not used to rest the thumb , but to provide leverage while using the thumb to pluck the strings .
the thumbrest was moved above the strings in 1970s models ( as a true thumbrest ) and eliminated in the 1980s .
nevertheless , some reissued versions of vintage fender basses in the 2010s do include a thumbrest .
the slap and pop method , or " thumbstyle " , most associated with funk , uses tones and percussive sounds achieved by striking , thumping , or " slapping " a string with the thumb and snapping ( or " popping " ) a string or strings with the index or middle fingers .
bassists often interpolate left hand-muted " ghost notes " between the slaps and pops to achieve a rapid percussive effect , and after a note is slapped or popped , the fretting hand may cause other notes to sound by using " hammer-ons " , " pull-offs " , or a left-hand glissando ( slide ) .
larry graham of sly and the family stone and graham central station was an early innovator of the slap style , and louis johnson of the brothers johnson is also credited as an early slap bass player .
slap and pop style is also used by many bassists in other genres , such as rock ( e .
g .
, j j burnel and les claypool ) , metal ( e .
g .
, eric langlois , martin mendez , fieldy and ryan martinie ) , and jazz fusion ( e .
g .
, marcus miller , victor wooten and alain caron ) .
slap style playing was popularized throughout the 1980s and early 1990s by pop bass players such as mark king ( from level *num* ) and rock bassists such as with pino palladino ( currently a member of the john mayer trio and bassist for the who ) , flea ( from the red hot chili peppers ) , billy gould ( from faith no more ) and alex katunich ( from incubus ) .
spank bass developed from the slap and pop style and treats the electric bass as a percussion instrument , striking the strings above the pickups with an open palmed hand .
wooten popularized the " double thump , " in which the string is slapped twice , on the upstroke and a downstroke ( for more information , see classical thump ) .
a rarely used playing technique related to slapping is the use of wooden dowel " funk fingers " , an approach popularized by tony levin .
a pick ( or plectrum ) produces a more pronounced attack , for speed , or personal preference .
bass with a pick is primarily associated with rock and punk rock , but players in other styles also use them .
picks can be used with alternating downstrokes and upstrokes , or with all downstrokes for a more consistent attack .
the pick is usually held with the index and thumb , with the up-and-down plucking motion supplied by the wrist .
there are many varieties of picks available , but due to the thicker , heavier strings of the electric bass , bassists tend to use heavier picks than those used for electric guitar , typically ranging from *num* .
*num* mm–3 .
*num* mm ( *num* .
*num* is unusual ) .
different materials are used for picks , including plastic , nylon , rubber , and felt , all of which produce different tones .
felt and rubber picks sound closer to a fingerstyle tone .
palm-muting is a widely used bass technique .
the outer edge of the palm of the picking hand is rested on the bridge while picking , and " mutes " the strings , shortening the sustain time .
the harder the palm presses , or the more string area that is contacted by the palm , the shorter the string's sustain .
the sustain of the picked note can be varied for each note or phrase .
the shorter sustain of a muted note on an electric bass can be used to imitate the shorter sustain and character of an upright bass .
palm-muting is commonly done while using a pick , but can also be done without a pick , as when doing down-strokes with the thumb .
one prominent example of the pick / palm-muting combination is paul mccartney , who has used this technique for decades .
sting also uses palm-muting , but often without a pick , using the thumb and first finger to pluck .
the fretting hand—the left hand for right-handed bass players and right hand for left-handed bass players—presses down the strings to play different notes and shape the tone or timbre of a plucked or picked note .
one fretting technique is " a finger per fret , " where each finger in the fretting hand plays one fret in a given position , giving the advantage that full chromatic scale of over an octave and a half can be played with no up-down wrist movement .
also , the double bass-style technique can be used for fretting .
this technique involves using four fingers in the space of three frets , especially in the lower positions ( i .
e .
, the fretting positions closer to the nut , where the space between notes is the widest ) .
when considering the spacing between notes , this is a comfortable distance for the average person's hand size , however it requires more up-down hand movements .
the main advantage of the " "four fingers in three frets " technique is less tendon strain , leading to a diminished likelihood of repetitive strain injury ( rsi ) .
the image below ( of a bassist performing tapping ) shows the four-in-three .
a player can use the fretting hand to change a sounded note , either by fully muting it after plucking it , or by partially muting it near the bridge to reduce volume , or make the note fade faster .
the fretting hand often mutes strings that are not being played to stop sympathetic vibrations , particularly when the player wants a " dry " or " focused " sound .
on the other hand , the sympathetic resonance of harmonically related strings are sometimes desirable .
in these cases , a bassist can fret harmonically related notes .
for example , while fretting a sustained " f " ( on the third fret of the " d " string ) , underneath an f major chord being played by a piano player , a bassist might hold down the " c " and low " f " below this note so their harmonics sound sympathetically .
the fretting hand can add vibrato to a plucked or picked note , either a gentle , narrow vibrato or a more exaggerated , wide vibrato with bigger pitch variations .
for fretted basses , vibrato is always an alternation between the pitch of the note and a slightly higher pitch .
for fretless basses , the player can use this style of vibrato , or they can alternate between the note and a slightly lower pitch , as is done with the double bass and on other unfretted stringed instruments .
while vibrato is mostly done on " stopped " notes—that is , notes that are pressed down on the fingerboard—open strings can also be vibratoed by pressing down on the string behind the nut .
as well , the fretting hand can be used to " bend " a plucked or picked note up in pitch , by pushing or pulling the string so that the note sounds at a higher pitch .
to create the opposite effect , a " bend down " , the string is pushed to a higher pitch before being plucked or picked and then allowed to fall to the lower , regular pitch after it is sounded .
though rare , some bassists may use a tremolo bar-equipped bass to produce the same effect .
in addition to pressing down one note at a time , bassists can also press down several notes at one time with their fretting hand to perform a double stop ( two notes at once ) or a chord .
while double stops and chords are used less often by bassists than by electric guitarists playing rhythm guitar , a variety of double stops and chords can be performed on the electric bass .
some double stops used by bassists include octaves .
chords can be especially with effective on instruments with higher ranges such as six-string basses .
another variation to fully pressing down a string is to gently graze the string with the finger at the harmonic node points on the string , which creates chime-like upper partials ( also called " overtones " ) .
glissando is an effect in which the fretting hand slides up or down the neck , which can be used to create a slide in pitch up or down .
a subtle glissando can be performed by moving the fretting hand without plucking or picking the string ; for a more pronounced effect , the string is plucked or picked first , or , in a metal or hardcore punk context , a pick may be scraped along the sides of the lower strings .
the fretting hand can also be used to sound notes , either by plucking an open string with the fretting hand , or , in the case of a string that has already been plucked or picked , by " hammering on " a higher pitch or " pulling off " a finger to pluck a lower fretted or open stringed note .
jazz bassists use a subtle form of fretting hand pizzicato by plucking a very brief open string grace note with the fretting hand right before playing the string with the plucking hand .
when a string is rapidly hammered on , the note can be prolonged into a trill .
in the two-handed tapping styles , bassists use both hands to play notes on the fretboard by rapidly pressing and holding the string to the fret .
instead of plucking or picking the string to create a sound , in this technique , the action of striking the string against the fret or the fretboard creates the sound .
since two hands can be used to play on the fretboard , this makes it possible to play interweaving contrapuntal lines , to simultaneously play a bass line and a simple chord , or play chords and arpeggios .
bassist john entwistle of the who tapped percussively on the strings , causing them to strike the fretboard with a twangy sound to create drum-style fills .
players noted for this technique include cliff burton , billy sheehan , stuart hamm , john myung , victor wooten , les claypool , mark king , and michael manring .
the chapman stick and warr guitars are string instruments specifically designed to play using two-handed tapping .
strumming , usually with finger nails , is a common technique on acoustic guitar , but it is not a commonly used technique for bass .
however , notable examples are stanley clarke's bass playing on the introduction to " school days " , on the album of the same name , and lemmy who was noted for his use of chords , often playing the bass like a rhythm guitar .
bernard edwards ( chic ) sometimes used a technique he called " chucking " to pluck the bass strings with the forefinger of his right hand , in a manner similar to how strings are plucked with a plectrum .
chucking uses the soft part of the forefinger and the nail of the forefinger to alternately strike the string in an up-down manner .
the thumb supports the forefinger at the first joint , as though using an invisible plectrum .
with a flexible wrist action , chucking facilitates rapid rhythmic sequences of notes played on different strings , particular notes that are an octave apart .
chucking is distinguished from plucking in that the attack is softer with a sound closer to that produced by the use of fingers .
chucking allows a mix of plucking and finger techniques on a given song , without having to take up or put down a plectrum .
examples of edwards’ use of chucking on his music man stingray bass can be heard on the intro and solo section of " everybody dance " and the foundation bass line of " dance dance dance " .
popular music bands and rock groups use the bass guitar as a member of the rhythm section , which provides the chord sequence or " progression " and sets out the " beat " for the song .
the rhythm section typically consists of a rhythm guitarist or electric keyboard player , or both , a bass guitarist and a drummer ; larger groups may add additional guitarists , keyboardists , or percussionists .
bassists often play a bass line composed by an arranger , songwriter or composer of a song—or , in the case of a cover song , the bass line from the original .
in other bands—e .
g .
, jazz-rock bands that play from lead sheets and country bands using the nashville number system—bassists are expected to improvise or prepare their own part to fit the song's chord progression and rhythmic style .
types of bass lines vary widely , depending on musical style .
the bass guitarist generally anchors the harmonic framework ( often by emphasizing the roots of the chord progression ) and laying down the beat in collaboration with the drummer and other rhythm section instruments .
the importance of the bass guitarist and the bass line varies in different styles of music .
in some pop styles , such as 1980s-era pop and musical theater , the bass sometimes plays a relatively simple part as the music emphasizes vocals and melody instruments .
in contrast , in reggae , funk , or hip-hop , entire songs may center on the bass groove , and the bass line is usually prominent in the mix .
in traditional music such as country music , folk rock , and related styles , the bass often plays the roots and fifth ( typically the fifth below the root ) of each chord in alternation .
in these styles , bassists often use scalar " walkups " or " walkdowns " when there is a chord change .
in chicago blues , the electric bass often performs a walking bassline made up of scales and arpeggios .
in blues rock bands , the bassist often plays blues scale-based riffs and chugging boogie-style lines .
in heavy metal , the bass guitar may perform complex riffs along with the rhythm guitarist or play a low , rumbling pedal point to anchor the group's sound .
chords are not used that often by electric bass players .
however , in some styles , bassists may sound " double stops " , such as octaves with open strings and powerchords .
in latin music , double stops with fifths are used .
robert trujillo of metallica is known for playing " massive chords " and " chord-based harmonics " on the bass .
lemmy of motörhead often played power chords in his bass lines .
the bass guitarist sometimes breaks out of the strict rhythm section role to perform bass breaks or bass solos .
the types of bass lines used for bass breaks or bass solos vary by style .
in a rock band , a bass break may consist of the bassist playing a riff or lick during a pause in the song .
in some styles of metal , a bass break may consist of " shred guitar"-style tapping on the bass .
in a funk or funk rock band , a bass solo may showcase the bassist's percussive slap and pop playing .
in genres such as progressive rock , art rock , or progressive metal , the bass guitar player may play melody lines along with the lead guitar ( or vocalist ) and perform extended guitar solos .
while bass guitar solos are not common in popular music , some artists , particularly in the heavy metal , funk , and progressive rock genres , do use them .
in a rock context , bass guitar solos are structured and performed in a similar fashion as rock guitar solos , often with the musical accompaniment from the verse or chorus sections .
bass solos are performed using a range of different techniques , such as plucking or fingerpicking .
in the 1960s , the who's bassist , john entwistle , performed a bass break on the song " my generation " using a plectrum .
he originally intended to use his fingers , but could not put his plectrum down quickly enough .
this is considered one of the first bass solos in rock music , and also one of the most recognizable .
funk bassists such as larry graham began using slapping and popping techniques for their solos , which coupled a percussive thumb-slapping technique of the lower strings with an aggressive finger-snap of the higher strings , often in rhythmic alternation .
the slapping and popping technique incorporates a large number of muted ( or ' ghost ' tones ) to normal notes to add to the rhythmic effect .
slapping and popping solos were prominent in 1980s pop and r&b , and they are still used by some modern funk and latin bands .
when playing bass solos , rock and metal bassists sometimes use effects such as fuzz bass or a wah-wah pedal to produce a more pronounced sound .
due to the lower range of the bass , bass guitar solos usually have a much lighter accompaniment than solos for other instruments .
in some cases , the bass guitar solo is unaccompanied , or accompanied only by the drums .
the electric bass is a relative newcomer to the world of jazz .
the big bands of the 1930s and 1940s swing era and the small combos of the 1950s bebop and hard bop movements all used the double bass .
the electric bass was introduced in some bands in the 1950s and it became prominent during the late 1960s and early 1970s , when rock influences were blended with jazz to create jazz-rock fusion .
the introduction of the electric bass in jazz fusion , as in the rock world , helped bassists play in high-volume stadium concerts with powerful amplifiers , because it is easier to amplify the electric bass than the double bass ( the latter is prone to feedback in high-volume settings ) .
the electric bass has both an accompaniment and a soloing role in jazz .
in accompaniment , the bassist may perform walking basslines for traditional tunes and jazz standards , playing smooth quarter note lines that imitate the double bass .
it is called a " walking bass line " because of the way it rises and falls using scale notes and passing notes .
for latin or salsa tunes and rock-infused jazz fusion tunes , the electric bass may play rapid , syncopated rhythmic figures in coordination with the drummer , or lay down a low , heavy groove .
in a jazz setting , the electric bass tends to have a much more expansive solo role than in most popular styles .
in most rock settings , the bass guitarist may only have a few short bass breaks or brief solos during a concert .
during a jazz concert , a jazz bassist may have a number of lengthy improvised solos , which are called " blowing " in jazz parlance .
whether a jazz bassist is comping ( accompanying ) or soloing , they usually aim to create a rhythmic drive and " timefeel " that creates a sense of " swing " and " groove " .
for information on notable jazz bassists , see the list of jazz bassists article .
contemporary classical music uses both the standard instruments of western art music ( piano , violin , double bass , etc .
) and newer instruments or sound producing devices , ranging from electrically amplified instruments to tape players and radios .
the electric bass guitar has occasionally been used in contemporary classical music ( art music ) since the late 1960s .
contemporary composers often obtained unusual sounds or instrumental timbres through the use of non-traditional ( or unconventional ) instruments or playing techniques .
as such , bass guitarists playing contemporary classical music may be instructed to pluck or strum the instrument in unusual ways .
however , contemporary classical composers may also write for the bass guitar to get its unique sound , and in particular its precise and piercing attack and timbre .
for example , steve reich , explaining his decision to score 2x5 for two bass guitars , stated that , " [ with electric bass guitars ] you can have interlocking bass lines , which on an acoustic bass , played pizzicato , would be mud .
" the pedagogy and training for the electric bass varies widely by genre and country .
rock and pop bass has a history of pedagogy dating back to the 1950s and 1960s , when method books were developed to help students learn the instrument .
one notable method book was carol kaye's " how to play the electric bass " .
in the jazz scene , since the bass guitar takes on much of the same role as the double bass—laying down the rhythm , and outlining the harmonic foundation—electric bass players have long used both bass guitar methods and jazz double bass method books .
the use of jazz double bass method books by electric bass players in jazz is facilitated in that jazz methods tend to emphasize improvisation techniques ( e .
g .
, how to improvise walking basslines ) and rhythmic exercises rather than specific ways of holding or plucking the instrument .
of all of the genres , jazz and the mainstream commercial genres ( rock , r&b , etc .
) have the most established and comprehensive systems of instruction and training for electric bass .
in the jazz scene , teens can begin taking private lessons on the instrument and performing in amateur big bands at high schools or run by the community .
young adults who aspire to be come professional jazz bassists or studio rock bassists can continue their studies in a variety of formal training settings , including colleges and some universities .
several colleges offer electric bass training in the us .
the bass institute of technology ( bit ) in los angeles was founded in *num* , as part of the musician's institute .
chuck rainey ( electric bassist for aretha franklin and marvin gaye ) was bit's first director .
bit was one of the earliest professional training program for electric bassists .
the program teaches a range of modern styles , including funk , rock , jazz , latin , and r&b .
the berklee college of music in boston offers training for electric bass players .
electric bass students get private lessons and there is a choice of over *num* ensembles to play in .
specific electric bass courses include funk / fusion styles for bass ; slap techniques for electric bass ; fingerstyle r&b ; five- and six-string electric bass playing ( including performing chords ) ; and how to read bass sheet music .
berklee college alumni include jeff andrews , victor bailey , jeff berlin , michael manring , and neil stubenhaus .
the bass department has two rooms with bass amps for classes and ten private lesson studios equipped with audio recording gear .
berklee offers instruction for the four- , five- , and six-string electric bass , the fretless bass , and double bass .
" students learn concepts in latin , funk , motown , and hip-hop , .
.
.
jazz , rock , and fusion .
" in canada , the humber college institute of technology & advanced learning offers an advanced diploma ( a three-year program ) in jazz and commercial music .
the program accepts performers who play bass , guitar , keyboard , drums , melody instruments ( e .
g .
, saxophone , flute , violin ) and who sing .
students get private lessons and perform in *num* student ensembles .
although there are far fewer university programs that offer electric bass instruction in jazz and popular music , some universities offer bachelor's degrees ( b .
mus .
) and master of music ( m .
mus .
) degrees in jazz performance or " commercial music " , where electric bass can be the main instrument .
in the us , the manhattan school of music has a jazz program leading to b .
mus .
and m .
mus degrees that accepts students who play bass ( double bass and electric bass ) , guitar , piano , drums , and melody instruments ( e .
g .
, saxophone , trumpet , etc .
) .
in the australian state of victoria , the victorian curriculum and assessment authority has set out minimum standards for its electric bass students doing their end-of-year solo performance recital .
to graduate , students must perform pieces and songs from a set list that includes baroque suite movements that were originally written for cello , 1960s motown tunes , 1970s fusion jazz solos , and 1980s slap bass tunes .
a typical program may include a prelude by j .
s .
bach ; " portrait of tracy " by jaco pastorius ; " twisted " by wardell gray and annie ross ; " what's going on " by james jamerson ; and the funky disco hit " le freak " by chic .
in addition to college and university diplomas and degrees , there are a variety of other training programs such as jazz or funk summer camps and festivals , which give students the opportunity to play a wide range of contemporary music , from 1970s-style jazz-rock fusion to 2000s-style r&b .
in other less mainstream genres , such as hardcore punk or metal , the pedagogical systems and training sequences are typically not formalized and institutionalized .
as such , many players learn by ear , by copying bass lines from records and cds , and by playing in a number of bands .
even in non-mainstream styles , though , students may be able to take lessons from experts in these or other styles , adapting learned techniques to their own style .
as well , there are a range of books , playing methods , and , since the 1990s , instructional dvds ( e .
g .
, how to play metal bass ) .
in the 2010s , many instructional videos are available online on video-sharing websites such as youtube .
cruising ( maritime ) cruising by boat is a lifestyle that involves living for extended time on a vessel while traveling from place to place for pleasure .
cruising generally refers to trips of a few days or more , and can extend to round-the-world voyages .
boats were almost exclusively used for working purposes prior to the nineteenth century .
in *num* , the philosopher henry david thoreau , with his book " canoeing in wilderness " chronicling his canoe voyaging in the wilderness of maine , was the first to convey the enjoyment of spiritual and lifestyle aspects of cruising .
the modern conception of cruising for pleasure was first popularised by the scottish explorer and sportsman john macgregor .
he was introduced to the canoes and kayaks of the native americans on a camping trip in *num* , and on his return to the united kingdom constructed his own ' double-ended ' canoe in lambeth .
the boat , nicknamed ' rob roy ' after a famous relative of his , was built of lapstrake oak planking , decked in cedar covered with rubberized canvas with an open cockpit in the center .
he cruised around the waterways of britain , europe and the middle east and wrote a popular book about his experiences , " a thousand miles in the rob roy canoe " .
in *num* , macgregor was a moving force behind the establishment of the royal canoe club , the first club in the world to promote pleasure cruising .
the first recorded regatta was held on april *num* , *num* , and it received royal patronage in *num* .
the latter part of the century saw cruising for leisure being enthusiastically taken up by the middle class .
the author robert louis stevenson wrote " an inland voyage " in *num* as a travelogue on his canoeing trip through france and belgium .
stevenson and his companion , sir walter grindlay simpson travelled in two ' rob roys ' along the oise river and witnessed the romantic beauty of rural europe .
the canadian-american joshua slocum was one of the first people to carry out a long-distance sailing voyage for pleasure , circumnavigating the world between *num* and *num* .
despite opinion that such a voyage was impossible , slocum rebuilt a derelict sloop " spray " and sailed her single-handed around the world .
his book " sailing alone around the world " was a classic adventure , and inspired many others to take to the seas .
other cruising authors have provided both inspiration and instruction to prospective cruisers .
key among these during the post world war ii period are electa and irving johnson , miles and beryl smeeton , bernard moitessier , peter pye , and eric and susan hiscock .
during the 1970s - 1990s robin lee graham , lin and larry pardey , annie hill , herb payson , linda and steve dashew , margaret and hal roth , and beth leonard & evans starzinger have provided inspiration for people to set off voyaging .
the development of ocean crossing rallies , most notably the arc ( atlantic rally for cruisers ) , have encouraged less experienced sailors to undertake ocean crossings .
these rallies provide a group of sailors crossing the same ocean at the same time with safety inspections , weather information and social functions .
cruising is done on both sail and power boats , monohulls and multihulls although sail predominates over longer distances , as ocean-going power boats are considerably more expensive to purchase and operate .
the size of the typical cruising boat has increased over the years and is currently in the range of *num* to *num* metres ( *num* to *num* feet ) although smaller boats have been used in around-the-world trips , but are generally not recommended given the dangers involved .
many cruisers are " long term " and travel for many years , the most adventurous among them circle the globe over a period of three to ten years .
many others take a year or two off from work and school for shorter trips and the chance to experience the cruising lifestyle .
blue-water cruising is more involved and inherently more dangerous than coastal cruising .
before embarking on an open-ocean voyage , planning and preparation will include studying charts , weather reports / warnings , almanacs and navigation books of the route to be followed .
in addition , supplies need to be stocked ( including fresh water and fuel ) , navigation instruments checked and the ship itself needs to be inspected and the crew needs to be given exact instruction on the jobs are expected to perform ( e .
g .
the watch ; which is generally *num* hours on and *num* hours off , navigation , steering , rigging sails , .
.
.
) .
in addition , the crew needs to be well trained at working together and with the ship in question .
finally , the sailor must be mentally prepared for dealing with harsh situations .
there have been many well-documented cases where sailors had to be rescued simply because they were not sufficiently prepared ( the sailors as well as the ship ) or lacked experience for their venture and ran into serious trouble .
sailing near the coast ( coastal cruising ) gives a certain amount of safety .
a ship is always granted ' innocent passage ' through the country ( most countries usually claim up to off the coast ) .
when this method is practiced however , if the ship needs to stop ( e .
g .
for repairs ) , a trip to a customs checkpoint to have passports checked would be required .
cruisers use a variety of equipment and techniques to make their voyages possible , or simply more comfortable .
the use of wind vane self steering was common on long distance cruising yachts but is increasingly being supplemented or replaced by electrical auto-pilots .
though in the past many cruisers had no means of generating electricity on board and depended on kerosene and dry-cell batteries , today electrical demands are much higher and nearly all cruisers have electrical devices such as lights , communications equipment and refrigeration .
although most boats can generate power from their inboard engines , an increasing number carry auxiliary generators .
carrying sufficient fuel to power engine and generator over a long voyage can be a problem , so many cruising boats are equipped with other ancillary generating devices such as solar panels , wind turbines and towed turbines .
cruisers choosing to spend extended time in very remote locations with minimal access to marinas can opt to equip their vessels with watermakers ( reverse-osmosis seawater desalination units ) used to convert sea water to potable fresh water .
satellite communications are becoming more common on cruising boats .
many boats are now equipped with satellite telephone systems ; however , these systems can be expensive to use , and may operate only in certain areas .
many cruisers still use short wave maritime ssb and amateur radio , which has no running costs .
these radios provide two-way voice communications , can receive weather fax graphics or grib files via a laptop computer , and with a compatible modem ( e .
g .
pactor ) can send and receive email at very slow speed .
such emails are usually limited to basic communication using plain text , without html formatting or attachments .
awareness of impending weather conditions is particularly important to cruising sailors who are often far from safe harbours and need to steer clear of dangerous weather conditions .
most cruising boats are equipped with a barometer or a weather station that records barometric pressure as well as temperature and provides rudimentary forecasting .
for more sophisticated weather forecasting , cruisers rely on their ability to receive forecasts by radio , phone or satellite .
in order to avoid collisions with other vessels , cruisers rely on a maintaining a regular watch schedule .
at night , color-coded running lights help determine the position and orientation of vessels .
radar and ais systems are often employed to detect vessels positions and movement in all conditions ( day , night , rain and fog ) .
cruisers navigate using paper charts and radar .
modern yachts are often also equipped with a chartplotter which enables the use of electronic charts and is linked to gps satellites that provide position reports .
some chartplotters have the ability to interface charts and radar images .
those that still wish to work with traditional charts as well as with gps may do so using a yeoman plotter .
certain advanced sailing vessels have a completely automated sailing system which includes a plotter , as well as course correcting through a link with the ship's steering organs ( e .
g .
sails , propeller ) .
one such device can be found at the maltese falcon .
purchasing and maintaining a yacht can be costly .
most cruising sailors do not own a house and consider their boat their home during the duration of their cruise .
many cruisers find they spend , on average , *num* % of their boat's purchase price annually on boat maintenance .
like living a conventional life on land , the cost of cruising is variable .
how much a person ends up spending depends largely on their spending habits ( for example , eating out a lot and frequenting marinas vs .
preparing local foods aboard and anchoring out ) and the type of boat ( fancy modern production boats are very expensive to purchase and maintain , while low-key cruising boats often involve much lower expenses ) .
most long-term cruisers prefer to live a simple life , usually with far lower expenses than people who live ashore .
an alternative solution is to sail on someone else's yacht .
those who know how to sail can sometimes find boats looking for an extra crewmember for a long trip , while some non-sailors are also able to find boats willing to carry a hitch-hiker .
crew-finding websites exist to help match-up people looking for a crossing with yachts with a berth available or looking for a temporary crewmember , find a crew for example .
another common tactic for finding a yacht is to visit local yacht clubs and marinas and get to know the sailors there , in the hope that one of them will be able to provide a berth .
travel by water brings hazards : collision , weather , and equipment failure can lead to dangerous situations such as a sinking or severely disabled and dangerous vessel .
for this reason many long distance cruising yachts carry with them emergency equipment such as sarts , epirbs and liferafts or proactive lifeboats .
medical emergencies are also of concern , as a medical emergency can occur on a long passage when the closest port is over a week away .
for this reason before going cruising many people go through first aid training and carry medical kits .
in some parts of the world ( e .
g .
, near the horn of africa ) piracy can be a problem .
fourier analysis in mathematics , fourier analysis ( ) is the study of the way general functions may be represented or approximated by sums of simpler trigonometric functions .
fourier analysis grew from the study of fourier series , and is named after joseph fourier , who showed that representing a function as a sum of trigonometric functions greatly simplifies the study of heat transfer .
today , the subject of fourier analysis encompasses a vast spectrum of mathematics .
in the sciences and engineering , the process of decomposing a function into oscillatory components is often called fourier analysis , while the operation of rebuilding the function from these pieces is known as fourier synthesis .
for example , determining what component frequencies are present in a musical note would involve computing the fourier transform of a sampled musical note .
one could then re-synthesize the same sound by including the frequency components as revealed in the fourier analysis .
in mathematics , the term " fourier analysis " often refers to the study of both operations .
the decomposition process itself is called a fourier transformation .
its output , the fourier transform , is often given a more specific name , which depends on the domain and other properties of the function being transformed .
moreover , the original concept of fourier analysis has been extended over time to apply to more and more abstract and general situations , and the general field is often known as harmonic analysis .
each transform used for analysis ( see list of fourier-related transforms ) has a corresponding inverse transform that can be used for synthesis .
fourier analysis has many scientific applications – in physics , partial differential equations , number theory , combinatorics , signal processing , digital image processing , probability theory , statistics , forensics , option pricing , cryptography , numerical analysis , acoustics , oceanography , sonar , optics , diffraction , geometry , protein structure analysis , and other areas .
this wide applicability stems from many useful properties of the transforms : in forensics , laboratory infrared spectrophotometers use fourier transform analysis for measuring the wavelengths of light at which a material will absorb in the infrared spectrum .
the ft method is used to decode the measured signals and record the wavelength data .
and by using a computer , these fourier calculations are rapidly carried out , so that in a matter of seconds , a computer-operated ft-ir instrument can produce an infrared absorption pattern comparable to that of a prism instrument .
fourier transformation is also useful as a compact representation of a signal .
for example , jpeg compression uses a variant of the fourier transformation ( discrete cosine transform ) of small square pieces of a digital image .
the fourier components of each square are rounded to lower arithmetic precision , and weak components are eliminated entirely , so that the remaining components can be stored very compactly .
in image reconstruction , each image square is reassembled from the preserved approximate fourier-transformed components , which are then inverse-transformed to produce an approximation of the original image .
when processing signals , such as audio , radio waves , light waves , seismic waves , and even images , fourier analysis can isolate narrowband components of a compound waveform , concentrating them for easier detection or removal .
a large family of signal processing techniques consist of fourier-transforming a signal , manipulating the fourier-transformed data in a simple way , and reversing the transformation .
some examples include : most often , the unqualified term fourier transform refers to the transform of functions of a continuous real argument , and it produces a continuous function of frequency , known as a " frequency distribution " .
one function is transformed into another , and the operation is reversible .
when the domain of the input ( initial ) function is time ( ) , and the domain of the output ( final ) function is ordinary frequency , the transform of function at frequency is given by the complex number : evaluating this quantity for all values of produces the " frequency-domain " function .
then can be represented as a recombination of complex exponentials of all possible frequencies : which is the inverse transform formula .
the complex number , , conveys both amplitude and phase of frequency .
see fourier transform for much more information , including : the fourier transform of a periodic function , , with period , becomes a dirac comb function , modulated by a sequence of complex coefficients : for all integer values of , and where is the integral over any interval of length " p " .
the inverse transform , known as fourier series , is a representation of in terms of a summation of a potentially infinite number of harmonically related sinusoids or complex exponential functions , each with an amplitude and phase specified by one of the coefficients : when , is expressed as a periodic summation of another function , : the coefficients are proportional to samples of at discrete intervals of : a sufficient condition for recovering ( and therefore ) from just these samples ( i .
e .
from the fourier series ) is that the non-zero portion of be confined to a known interval of duration , which is the frequency domain dual of the nyquist–shannon sampling theorem .
see fourier series for more information , including the historical development .
the dtft is the mathematical dual of the time-domain fourier series .
thus , a convergent periodic summation in the frequency domain can be represented by a fourier series , whose coefficients are samples of a related continuous time function : which is known as the dtft .
thus the dtft of the sequence is also the fourier transform of the modulated dirac comb function .
the fourier series coefficients ( and inverse transform ) , are defined by : parameter corresponds to the sampling interval , and this fourier series can now be recognized as a form of the poisson summation formula .
thus we have the important result that when a discrete data sequence , , is proportional to samples of an underlying continuous function , , one can observe a periodic summation of the continuous fourier transform , .
that is a cornerstone in the foundation of digital signal processing .
furthermore , under certain idealized conditions one can theoretically recover and exactly .
a sufficient condition for perfect recovery is that the non-zero portion of be confined to a known frequency interval of width .
when that interval is , the applicable reconstruction formula is the whittaker–shannon interpolation formula .
another reason to be interested in is that it often provides insight into the amount of aliasing caused by the sampling process .
applications of the dtft are not limited to sampled functions .
see discrete-time fourier transform for more information on this and other topics , including : similar to a fourier series , the dtft of a periodic sequence , , with period , becomes a dirac comb function , modulated by a sequence of complex coefficients ( see dtft / periodic data ) : the sequence is what is customarily known as the dft of _{\triangleq\ , \frac{1}{t} s_\frac{1}{t}\left ( \frac{k}{nt}\right ) / / conversely , when one wants to compute an arbitrary number ( ) of discrete samples of one cycle of a continuous dtft , , it can be done by computing the relatively simple dft of , as defined above .
in most cases , is chosen equal to the length of non-zero portion of .
increasing , known as " zero-padding " or " interpolation " , results in more closely spaced samples of one cycle of .
decreasing , causes overlap ( adding ) in the time-domain ( analogous to aliasing ) , which corresponds to decimation in the frequency domain .
( see sampling the dtft ) in most cases of practical interest , the sequence represents a longer sequence that was truncated by the application of a finite-length window function or fir filter array .
the dft can be computed using a fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm , which makes it a practical and important transformation on computers .
see discrete fourier transform for much more information , including : for periodic functions , both the fourier transform and the dtft comprise only a discrete set of frequency components ( fourier series ) , and the transforms diverge at those frequencies .
one common practice ( not discussed above ) is to handle that divergence via dirac delta and dirac comb functions .
but the same spectral information can be discerned from just one cycle of the periodic function , since all the other cycles are identical .
similarly , finite-duration functions can be represented as a fourier series , with no actual loss of information except that the periodicity of the inverse transform is a mere artifact .
we also note that it is common in practice for the duration of " s " ( • ) to be limited to the period , or .
but these formulas do not require that condition .
when the real and imaginary parts of a complex function are decomposed into their even and odd parts , there are four components , denoted below by the subscripts re , ro , ie , and io .
and there is a one-to-one mapping between the four components of a complex time function and the four components of its complex frequency transform : from this , various relationships are apparent , for example : the fourier variants can also be generalized to fourier transforms on arbitrary locally compact abelian topological groups , which are studied in harmonic analysis ; there , the fourier transform takes functions on a group to functions on the dual group .
this treatment also allows a general formulation of the convolution theorem , which relates fourier transforms and convolutions .
see also the pontryagin duality for the generalized underpinnings of the fourier transform .
more specific , fourier analysis can be done on cosets , even discrete cosets .
in signal processing terms , a function ( of time ) is a representation of a signal with perfect " time resolution " , but no frequency information , while the fourier transform has perfect " frequency resolution " , but no time information .
as alternatives to the fourier transform , in time–frequency analysis , one uses time–frequency transforms to represent signals in a form that has some time information and some frequency information – by the uncertainty principle , there is a trade-off between these .
these can be generalizations of the fourier transform , such as the short-time fourier transform , the gabor transform or fractional fourier transform ( frft ) , or can use different functions to represent signals , as in wavelet transforms and chirplet transforms , with the wavelet analog of the ( continuous ) fourier transform being the continuous wavelet transform .
a primitive form of harmonic series dates back to ancient babylonian mathematics , where they were used to compute ephemerides ( tables of astronomical positions ) .
the classical greek concepts of deferent and epicycle in the ptolemaic system of astronomy were related to fourier series ( see deferent and epicycle : mathematical formalism ) .
in modern times , variants of the discrete fourier transform were used by alexis clairaut in *num* to compute an orbit , which has been described as the first formula for the dft , and in *num* by joseph louis lagrange , in computing the coefficients of a trigonometric series for a vibrating string .
technically , clairaut's work was a cosine-only series ( a form of discrete cosine transform ) , while lagrange's work was a sine-only series ( a form of discrete sine transform ) ; a true cosine+sine dft was used by gauss in *num* for trigonometric interpolation of asteroid orbits .
euler and lagrange both discretized the vibrating string problem , using what would today be called samples .
an early modern development toward fourier analysis was the *num* paper " réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations " by lagrange , which in the method of lagrange resolvents used a complex fourier decomposition to study the solution of a cubic : lagrange transformed the roots into the resolvents : where is a cubic root of unity , which is the dft of order *num* .
a number of authors , notably jean le rond d'alembert , and carl friedrich gauss used trigonometric series to study the heat equation , but the breakthrough development was the *num* paper " mémoire sur la propagation de la chaleur dans les corps solides " by joseph fourier , whose crucial insight was to model " all " functions by trigonometric series , introducing the fourier series .
historians are divided as to how much to credit lagrange and others for the development of fourier theory : daniel bernoulli and leonhard euler had introduced trigonometric representations of functions , and lagrange had given the fourier series solution to the wave equation , so fourier's contribution was mainly the bold claim that an arbitrary function could be represented by a fourier series .
the subsequent development of the field is known as harmonic analysis , and is also an early instance of representation theory .
the first fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm for the dft was discovered around *num* by carl friedrich gauss when interpolating measurements of the orbit of the asteroids juno and pallas , although that particular fft algorithm is more often attributed to its modern rediscoverers cooley and tukey .
in signal processing , the fourier transform often takes a time series or a function of continuous time , and maps it into a frequency spectrum .
that is , it takes a function from the time domain into the frequency domain ; it is a decomposition of a function into sinusoids of different frequencies ; in the case of a fourier series or discrete fourier transform , the sinusoids are harmonics of the fundamental frequency of the function being analyzed .
when the function is a function of time and represents a physical signal , the transform has a standard interpretation as the frequency spectrum of the signal .
the magnitude of the resulting complex-valued function at frequency represents the amplitude of a frequency component whose initial phase is given by the phase of .
fourier transforms are not limited to functions of time , and temporal frequencies .
they can equally be applied to analyze " spatial " frequencies , and indeed for nearly any function domain .
this justifies their use in such diverse branches as image processing , heat conduction , and automatic control .
barbagia barbagia ( or ) is a mountain area of inner sardinia .
it is a natural region mostly contained in the province of nuoro and located alongside the gennargentu massif .
the name comes from cicero , who described it as a land of barbarians ( " barbaria " , βαρβαρία in ancient greek ) .
this word derives from the greek βάρβαρος , which means " stuttering " .
the sardinians from this area were also known , by the ancient romans , with the pejorative term " latrones mastrucati " , which means " thieves with a rough garment in wool " ; roman domination in this part of sardinia was never more than nominal .
in *num* , pope gregory the great wrote a letter to hospito , a christian whom he calls the " leader of the barbaricini " ( " dux barbaricinorum " ) .
hospito apparently permitted the evangelisation of pagan barbagia by christian missionaries .
the area is usually divided into five barbagias : the barbagia of ollolai , the barbagia of seulo , the barbagia of belvì , the mandrolisai , and finally the " barbagia trigònia " , the historical name by which the area of ogliastra was once referred to .
the latter two are named after a sub-region , and the others after their main villages .
the area is full of hard hills and mountains , and there is little human presence .
barbagia is one of the least populated areas in europe , which has allowed barbagia to preserve its cultural and natural treasures .
barbagia is one of the few sardinian regions where the sardinian language in its own varieties , both nuorese and campidanese , is still spoken on an everyday basis , while the rest of the island has already undergone shift to italian .
one of the most important villages is gavoi .
orgosolo was famous for its bandits and kidnappers and typical murals .
oliena is well known for its wines ( especially the " nepente " , a wine made with cannonau grapes ) .
another well known town is fonni , the highest town in sardinia at more than *num* , *num* meters above sea level .
fonni is also the gateway to the gennargentu mountain system .
the economy consists of agriculture , sheep breeding , art and tradition related business , tourism and light industry .
dkw dkw ( dampf-kraft-wagen , , also deutsche kinder-wagen .
das-kleine-wunder , or des-knaben-wunsch , ) is a german car and motorcycle marque .
the company and brand is one of the ancestor companies of the modern day audi company , being one of the four companies that formed auto-union .
in *num* , danish engineer jørgen skafte rasmussen founded a factory in zschopau , saxony , germany , to produce steam fittings .
that year he attempted to produce a steam-driven car , called the dkw .
although unsuccessful , he made a two-stroke toy engine in *num* , called " des knaben wunsch " – " the boy's wish " .
he put a slightly modified version of this engine into a motorcycle and called it " das kleine wunder " – " the little wonder " the initials from this becoming the dkw brand : by the late 1920s , dkw was the world's largest motorcycle manufacturer .
in september *num* , dkw bought , saving them from germany's hyperinflation economic crisis .
rudolf slaby became chief-engineer at dkw .
.
in *num* , dkw merged with audi , horch and wanderer to form auto union .
after world war ii , dkw moved to west germany , with the original factory becoming mz .
auto union came under daimler-benz ownership in *num* and was purchased by the volkswagen group in *num* .
the last german-built dkw car was the f102 , which ceased production in *num* .
its successor , the four-stroke f103 , was marketed under the audi brand , another auto union marque .
dkw-badged cars continued to be built under license in brazil and argentina until *num* and *num* respectively .
the dkw trademark is currently owned by auto union gmbh , a wholly owned subsidiary of audi ag which also owns the rights to other historical trademarks and intellectual property of the auto union combine .
dkw cars were made from *num* until *num* , apart from an interruption caused by the second world war .
dkws always used two-stroke engines , reflecting the company's position by the end of the 1920s as the world's largest producer of motorcycles .
the first dkw car , the small and rather crude typ p , emerged on *num* may *num* and the model continued to be built at the company's spandau ( berlin ) plant , first as a roadster and later as a stylish if basic sports car , until *num* .
more significant was a series of inexpensive cars built *num* km ( *num* miles ) to the south in zwickau in the plant acquired by the company's owner in *num* when he had become the majority owner in audi werke ag .
models f1 to f8 ( f for front ) were built between *num* and *num* , with successor models reappearing after the end of the war in *num* .
they were the first volume production cars in europe with front wheel drive , and were powered by transversely mounted two-cylinder two-stroke engines .
displacement was *num* or *num* cc : claimed maximum power was initially *num* ps , and from *num* a choice between *num* or .
these models had a generator that doubled as a starter , mounted directly on the crankshaft , known as a dynastart .
dkws from zwickau notched up approximately *num* , *num* units between *num* and *num* .
most cars were sold on the home market and over *num* % of dkws produced in the 1930s were the little f series cars : dkw reached second place in german sales by *num* and stayed there , accounting for *num* , *num* of the cars sold between *num* and *num* , more than *num* % of the market .
between *num* and *num* , dkw produced a less well remembered but technically intriguing series of rear-wheel drive cars called ( among other names ) " schwebeklasse " and " sonderklasse " with two-stroke v4 engines .
engine displacement was *num* , *num* cc , later *num* , *num* cc .
the engines had two extra cylinders for forced induction , so they appeared like v6 engines but without spark plugs on the front cylinder pair .
in *num* , dkw made a prototype with the first three-cylinder engine , with a displacement of *num* cc and producing .
with a streamlined body , the car could run at .
it was put into production after world war ii , first as an industrieverband fahrzeugbau ( ifa ) f9 ( later wartburg ) in zwickau , east germany , and shortly afterwards in dkw-form from düsseldorf as the 3=6 or f91 .
dkw engines were used by saab as a model for the saab two-stroke in its saab *num* car manufacturing venture , in *num* .
as auto union was based in saxony in what became the german democratic republic , it took some time for it to regroup after the war .
the company was registered in west germany as auto union gmbh in *num* , first as a spare-part provider , but soon to take up production of the rt *num* motorcycle and a new delivery van , called a " schnellaster " f800 .
their first line of production took place in düsseldorf .
this van used the same engine as the last f8 made before the war .
their first car was the f89 using the body from the prototype f9 made before the war and the two-cylinder two-stroke engine from the last f8 .
production went on until it was replaced by the successful three-cylinder engine that came with the f91 .
the f91 was in production 1953–1955 , and was replaced by the larger f93 in *num* .
the f91 and f93 had *num* cc three-cylinder two-stroke engines , the first ones delivering , the last .
the ignition system comprised three independent sets of points and coils , one for each cylinder , with the points mounted in a cluster around a single lobed cam at the front end of the crankshaft .
the cooling system was of the free convection type assisted by a fan driven from a pulley mounted at the front end of the crankshaft .
the f93 was produced until *num* , and was replaced by the auto-union *num* .
these models where produced with a *num* , *num* cc two-stroke engine , with a choice between or s versions until *num* .
during this transition , production was moved from düsseldorf to ingolstadt , where audi still has its production .
from *num* , the cars could be fitted with a saxomat , an automatic clutch , the only small car then offering this feature .
the last versions of the auto-union 1000s had disc brakes as option , an early development for this technology .
a sporting 2+2 seater version was available as the auto-union *num* sp from *num* to *num* , the first years only as a coupé and from *num* also as a convertible .
in *num* , the very rare dkw monza was put into small-scale production on a private initiative , with a sporting two-seater body of glassfiber on a standard f93 frame .
it was first called solitude , but got its final name from the long-distance speed records it made on the autodromo nazionale monza in italy in november *num* .
running in fédération internationale de l'automobile ( fia ) class g , it set records including *num* hours at an average speed of , *num* , *num* km at and *num* hours at .
the car was first produced by in stuttgart , then by massholder in heidelberg and lastly by robert schenk in stuttgart .
the number produced is said to be around *num* and production finished by the end of *num* .
a more successful range of cars was sold from *num* , the junior / f12 series based on a modern concept from the late 1950s .
the range consists of junior ( basic model ) made from *num* to *num* , junior de luxe ( a little enhanced ) from *num* to *num* , f11 ( a little larger ) and f12 ( larger and bigger engine ) from *num* to *num* , and f12 roadster from *num* to *num* .
the junior / f12 series became quite popular , and many cars were produced .
an assembly plant was licensed in ballincollig , co .
cork , ireland between *num* and c .
*num* and roughly *num* , *num* vehicles were assembled , ranging from saloons , vans and motorbikes to commercial combine harvesters .
this was the only dkw factory outside germany in europe and for many years after its closure its large dkw sign could be visible on the wall of the factory .
the building was demolished in the late 2000s and was redeveloped into the german aldi store and a mcdonalds drive-thru .
all the three-cylinder two-stroke post-war cars had some sporting potential and formed the basis for many rally victories in the 1950s and early 1960s .
this made dkw the most winning car brand in the european rally league for several years during the fifties .
in *num* , dkw developed a v6 engine by combining two three-cylinder two-stroke engines , with a capacity of *num* , *num* cc .
the capacity was increased and the final v6 in *num* had a capacity of *num* , *num* cc , which developed at *num* , *num* rpm using the standard configuration with two carburettors .
a four-carburettor version produced , a six-carburettor one .
it weighed only .
the v6 was planned to be used in the dkw munga and the f102 .
about *num* engines were built for testing purposes and *num* dkw f102 and some mungas were fitted with the v6 engine in the 1960s .
the last dkw was the f102 , coming into production in *num* as a replacement for the old-looking au1000 .
however , the f102 sold poorly - largely due to its two-stroke engine technology which was at the limit of its development , resulting in auto union's parent - daimler-benz , to offload the company to volkswagen .
the car was re-engineered with a four-stroke engine and relaunched under the resurrected audi brand as the f103 .
the transition to four-stroke engines marked the end of the dkw marque for cars , and the rebirth of the audi name .
from *num* to *num* , dutch importer hart , nibbrig & greve assembled cars in an abandoned asphalt factory in sassenheim , where they employed about *num* workers , two transporter , that collected skd kits from duesseldorf and build about *num* .
*num* cars .
when the dkw plant moved the import of skd kits stopped , as it became too expensive .
from *num* to *num* , dkw cars were made in brazil by the local company vemag ( " veículos e máquinas agrícolas s .
a .
" , " vehicles and agricultural machinery inc .
" ) .
vemag was assembling scania-vabis trucks , but scania vabis became an independent company in july *num* .
the original plans were to build the candango off-roader ( munga ) , a utility vehicle and a four-door sedan , called vemaguet and belcar respectively .
the first model built was the *num* cc f91 universal but the belcar and vemaguet names were applied later .
in *num* , the f94 four-door sedan and station wagon were launched , in the early 1960s renamed belcar and vemaguet .
the company also produced a luxury coupe ( the dkw fissore ) and the off-road munga ( locally called candango ) .
in *num* vemag cars received the larger one-litre , engine from the auto union *num* .
vemag had a successful official racing team , with the coupe gt malzoni , with fiberglass body .
this project was the foundation of the long-lasting brazilian sports car brand puma .
the brazilian f94 line has been improved with several cosmetic changes and became more and more different from the german and argentine models .
vemag had no capital to invest in new products and came under governmental pressure to merge .
in 1964-1965 volkswagen gradually took over auto union , a minority holder in vemag , and in *num* volkswagen bought the remainder of the stock .
vw quickly began phasing out dkw-vemag production and introduced the volkswagen *num* sedan to the old vemag plant , after a total of *num* , *num* dkw-vemag cars had been built .
dkw vehicles were made in argentina from *num* to *num* by iasf s .
a .
( industria automotriz santa fe sociedad anónima ) in sauce viejo , santa fe .
the most beautiful were the cupé fissore , which had many famous owners ( julio sosa , césar luis menotti , and others ) .
other models are the auto union *num* s sedán ( *num* , *num* made until *num* ) and the auto union *num* universal s ( *num* , *num* made until *num* ) .
and the auto union combi / pick-up .
the last version of the auto union combi / pick-up ( dkw f1000 l ) , launched in *num* , survived a few months and was bought out by ime , which continued production until *num* .
the dkw munga was built by auto union in ingolstadt .
production began in october *num* and ended in december *num* , with *num* , *num* cars built .
from *num* to *num* , dkw produced the " schnellaster " with a trailing-arm rear suspension system with springs in the cross bar assembly .
spanish subsidiary imosa produced a modern successor introduced in *num* , the dkw f *num* l .
this van started with the three-cylinder *num* , *num* cc engine , but later received a mercedes-benz diesel engine and was renamed a mercedes-benz in *num* .
during the late 1920s and until wwii broke out , dkw was the world's largest motorcycle manufacturer and the pioneer of front wheel drive automobiles with their dkw front , along with the citroen traction avant .
in *num* , ing zoller started building split-singles and this concept made dkw the dominant racing motorcycle in the lightweight and junior classes between the wars .
this included off-road events like the international six days trial where the marque scored some considerable inter-war year successes alongside bavarian motor works at the same time , the company also had some success with super-charged racing motorcycles which because of their light weight were particularly successful in the isdt the motorcycle branch produced famous models such as the rt *num* pre- and post-world war ii , and after the war with production at the original factory in gdr becoming mz it made *num* , *num* and *num* ( cc ) models .
as war reparations , the design drawings of the rt125 were given to harley-davidson in the us and bsa in the uk .
the harley-davidson version was known loosely as the hummer ( hummer is really just a few specific years , but generally people call the harley lightweights hummers ) , while bsa used them for the bantam .
ifa and later mz models continued in production until the 1990s , when economics brought production of the two stroke to an end .
other manufacturers copied the dkw design , officially or otherwise .
this can be seen in the similarity of many small two-stroke motorcycles from the 1950s , including from yamaha , voskhod , maserati , and polish wsk .
awk awk is a programming language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool .
it is a standard feature of most unix-like operating systems .
the awk language is a data-driven scripting language consisting of a set of actions to be taken against streams of textual data – either run directly on files or used as part of a pipeline – for purposes of extracting or transforming text , such as producing formatted reports .
the language extensively uses the string datatype , associative arrays ( that is , arrays indexed by key strings ) , and regular expressions .
while awk has a limited intended application domain and was especially designed to support one-liner programs , the language is turing-complete , and even the early bell labs users of awk often wrote well-structured large awk programs .
awk was created at bell labs in the 1970s , and its name is derived from the surnames of its authors—alfred aho , peter weinberger , and brian kernighan .
the acronym is pronounced the same as the name of the bird auk ( which acts as an emblem of the language such as on " the awk programming language " book cover – the book is often referred to by the abbreviation " tapl " ) .
when written in all lowercase letters , as codice_1 , it refers to the unix or plan *num* program that runs scripts written in the awk programming language .
awk was initially developed in *num* by alfred aho , peter weinberger , and brian kernighan , from whose initials the language takes its name .
as one of the early tools to appear in version *num* unix , awk added computational features to a unix pipeline besides the bourne shell , the only scripting language available in a standard unix environment .
it is one of the mandatory utilities of the single unix specification , and is required by the linux standard base specification .
awk was significantly revised and expanded in 1985–88 , resulting in the gnu awk implementation written by paul rubin , jay fenlason , and richard stallman , released in *num* .
gnu awk may be the most widely deployed version because it is included with gnu-based linux packages .
gnu awk has been maintained solely by arnold robbins since *num* .
brian kernighan's nawk ( new awk ) source was first released in *num* unpublicized , and publicly since the late 1990s ; many bsd systems use it to avoid the gpl license .
awk was preceded by sed ( *num* ) .
both were designed for text processing .
they share the line-oriented , data-driven paradigm , and are particularly suited to writing one-liner programs , due to the implicit main loop and current line variables .
the power and terseness of early awk programs – notably the powerful regular expression handling and conciseness due to implicit variables , which facilitate one-liners – together with the limitations of awk at the time , were important inspirations for the perl language ( *num* ) .
in the 1990s , perl became very popular , competing with awk in the niche of unix text-processing languages .
"awk is a language for processing text files .
a file is treated as a sequence of records , and by default each line is a record .
each line is broken up into a sequence of fields , so we can think of the first word in a line as the first field , the second word as the second field , and so on .
an awk program is a sequence of pattern-action statements .
awk reads the input a line at a time .
a line is scanned for each pattern in the program , and for each pattern that matches , the associated action is executed .
" - alfred v .
aho an awk program is a series of pattern action pairs , written as : where " condition " is typically an expression and " action " is a series of commands .
the input is split into records , where by default records are separated by newline characters so that the input is split into lines .
the program tests each record against each of the conditions in turn , and executes the " action " for each expression that is true .
either the " condition " or the " action " may be omitted .
the " condition " defaults to matching every record .
the default " action " is to print the record .
this is the same pattern-action structure as sed .
in addition to a simple awk expression , such as codice_2 or codice_3 , the " condition " can be codice_4 or codice_5 causing the " action " to be executed before or after all records have been read , or " pattern1 , pattern2 " which matches the range of records starting with a record that matches " pattern1 " up to and including the record that matches " pattern2 " before again trying to match against " pattern1 " on future lines .
in addition to normal arithmetic and logical operators , awk expressions include the tilde operator , codice_6 , which matches a regular expression against a string .
as handy syntactic sugar , " / regexp / " without using the tilde operator matches against the current record ; this syntax derives from sed , which in turn inherited it from the ed editor , where codice_7 is used for searching .
this syntax of using slashes as delimiters for regular expressions was subsequently adopted by perl and ecmascript , and is now quite common .
the tilde operator was also adopted by perl , but has not seen as wide use .
awk commands are the statements that are substituted for " action " in the examples above .
awk commands can include function calls , variable assignments , calculations , or any combination thereof .
awk contains built-in support for many functions ; many more are provided by the various flavors of awk .
also , some flavors support the inclusion of dynamically linked libraries , which can also provide more functions .
the " print " command is used to output text .
the output text is always terminated with a predefined string called the output record separator ( ors ) whose default value is a newline .
the simplest form of this command is : although these fields ( " $x " ) may bear resemblance to variables ( the $ symbol indicates variables in perl ) , they actually refer to the fields of the current record .
a special case , " $0 " , refers to the entire record .
in fact , the commands " codice_8 " and " codice_12 " are identical in functionality .
the " print " command can also display the results of calculations and / or function calls : output may be sent to a file : or through a pipe : awk's built-in variables include the field variables : $1 , $2 , $3 , and so on ( $0 represents the entire record ) .
they hold the text or values in the individual text-fields in a record .
other variables include : variable names can use any of the characters [ a-za-z0-9_ ] , with the exception of language keywords .
the operators " + - * / " represent addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division , respectively .
for string concatenation , simply place two variables ( or string constants ) next to each other .
it is optional to use a space in between if string constants are involved , but two variable names placed adjacent to each other require a space in between .
double quotes delimit string constants .
statements need not end with semicolons .
finally , comments can be added to programs by using " # " as the first character on a line .
in a format similar to c , function definitions consist of the keyword codice_21 , the function name , argument names and the function body .
here is an example of a function .
this statement can be invoked as follows : functions can have variables that are in the local scope .
the names of these are added to the end of the argument list , though values for these should be omitted when calling the function .
it is convention to add some whitespace in the argument list before the local variables , to indicate where the parameters end and the local variables begin .
here is the customary " hello , world " program written in awk : note that an explicit codice_22 statement is not needed here ; since the only pattern is codice_4 , no command-line arguments are processed .
print all lines longer than *num* characters .
note that the default action is to print the current line .
count words in the input and print the number of lines , words , and characters ( like wc ) : as there is no pattern for the first line of the program , every line of input matches by default , so the increment actions are executed for every line .
note that codice_24 is shorthand for codice_25 .
"s " is incremented by the numeric value of " $nf " , which is the last word on the line as defined by awk's field separator ( by default , white-space ) .
" nf " is the number of fields in the current line , e .
g .
*num* .
since " $4 " is the value of the fourth field , " $nf " is the value of the last field in the line regardless of how many fields this line has , or whether it has more or fewer fields than surrounding lines .
$ is actually a unary operator with the highest operator precedence .
( if the line has no fields , then " nf " is *num* , " $0 " is the whole line , which in this case is empty apart from possible white-space , and so has the numeric value *num* .
) at the end of the input the " end " pattern matches , so " s " is printed .
however , since there may have been no lines of input at all , in which case no value has ever been assigned to " s " , it will by default be an empty string .
adding zero to a variable is an awk idiom for coercing it from a string to a numeric value .
( concatenating an empty string is to coerce from a number to a string , e .
g .
" s " " " .
note , there's no operator to concatenate strings , they're just placed adjacently .
) with the coercion the program prints " *num* " on an empty input , without it an empty line is printed .
the action statement prints each line numbered .
the printf function emulates the standard c printf and works similarly to the print command described above .
the pattern to match , however , works as follows : " nr " is the number of records , typically lines of input , awk has so far read , i .
e .
the current line number , starting at *num* for the first line of input .
" % " is the modulo operator .
" nr % *num* == *num* " is true for the *ord* , *ord* , *ord* , etc .
, lines of input .
likewise , " nr % *num* == *num* " is true for the *ord* , *ord* , *ord* , etc .
, lines of input .
the range pattern is false until the first part matches , on line *num* , and then remains true up to and including when the second part matches , on line *num* .
it then stays false until the first part matches again on line *num* .
thus , the program prints lines *num* , *num* , *num* , skips line *num* , and then *num* , *num* , *num* , and so on .
for each line , it prints the line number ( on a *num* character-wide field ) and then the line contents .
for example , when executed on this input : the previous program prints : as a special case , when the first part of a range pattern is constantly true , e .
g .
" *num* " , the range will start at the beginning of the input .
similarly , if the second part is constantly false , e .
g .
" *num* " , the range will continue until the end of input .
for example , prints lines of input from the first line matching the regular expression " ^--cut here--$ " , that is , a line containing only the phrase " --cut here-- " , to the end .
word frequency using associative arrays : the begin block sets the field separator to any sequence of non-alphabetic characters .
note that separators can be regular expressions .
after that , we get to a bare action , which performs the action on every input line .
in this case , for every field on the line , we add one to the number of times that word , first converted to lowercase , appears .
finally , in the end block , we print the words with their frequencies .
the line creates a loop that goes through the array " words " , setting " i " to each " subscript " of the array .
this is different from most languages , where such a loop goes through each " value " in the array .
the loop thus prints out each word followed by its frequency count .
codice_26 was an addition to the one true awk ( see below ) made after the book was published .
this program can be represented in several ways .
the first one uses the bourne shell to make a shell script that does everything .
it is the shortest of these methods : the codice_27 in the awk command is not protected by single quotes so that the shell does expand the variable but it needs to be put in double quotes to properly handle patterns containing spaces .
a pattern by itself in the usual way checks to see if the whole line ( codice_28 ) matches .
codice_15 contains the current filename .
awk has no explicit concatenation operator ; two adjacent strings concatenate them .
codice_28 expands to the original unchanged input line .
there are alternate ways of writing this .
this shell script accesses the environment directly from within awk : this is a shell script that uses codice_31 , an array introduced in a newer version of the one true awk after the book was published .
the subscript of codice_31 is the name of an environment variable ; its result is the variable's value .
this is like the getenv function in various standard libraries and posix .
the shell script makes an environment variable codice_33 containing the first argument , then drops that argument and has awk look for the pattern in each file .
codice_6 checks to see if its left operand matches its right operand ; codice_35 is its inverse .
note that a regular expression is just a string and can be stored in variables .
the next way uses command-line variable assignment , in which an argument to awk can be seen as an assignment to a variable : or you can use the " -v var=value " command line option ( e .
g .
" awk -v pattern="$pattern " .
.
.
" ) .
finally , this is written in pure awk , without help from a shell or without the need to know too much about the implementation of the awk script ( as the variable assignment on command line one does ) , but is a bit lengthy : the codice_4 is necessary not only to extract the first argument , but also to prevent it from being interpreted as a filename after the codice_4 block ends .
codice_38 , the number of arguments , is always guaranteed to be ≥1 , as codice_39 is the name of the command that executed the script , most often the string codice_40 .
also note that codice_41 is the empty string , codice_42 .
codice_43 initiates a comment that expands to the end of the line .
note the codice_44 block .
awk only checks to see if it should read from standard input before it runs the command .
this means that only works because the fact that there are no filenames is only checked before codice_45 is run ! if you explicitly set codice_38 to *num* so that there are no arguments , awk will simply quit because it feels there are no more input files .
therefore , you need to explicitly say to read from standard input with the special filename codice_47 .
on unix-like operating systems self-contained awk scripts can be constructed using the shebang syntax .
for example , a script that prints the content of a given file may be built by creating a file named codice_48 with the following content : it can be invoked with : codice_49 the codice_50 tells awk that the argument that follows is the file to read the awk program from , which is the same flag that is used in sed .
since they are often used for one-liners , both these programs default to executing a program given as a command-line argument , rather than a separate file .
awk was originally written in *num* and distributed with version *num* unix .
in *num* its authors started expanding the language , most significantly by adding user-defined functions .
the language is described in the book " the awk programming language " , published *num* , and its implementation was made available in releases of unix system v .
to avoid confusion with the incompatible older version , this version was sometimes called " new awk " or " nawk " .
this implementation was released under a free software license in *num* and is still maintained by brian kernighan ( see external links below ) .
old versions of unix , such as unix / 32v , included codice_51 , which converted awk to c .
kernighan wrote a program to turn awk into c++ ; its state is not known .
ghana armed forces the ghana armed forces ( gaf ) is the unified armed force of ghana , consisting of the army ( ga ) , navy ( gn ) , and ghana air force .
the gaf are supervised by the ghanaian ministry of defence .
the commander-in-chief of the ghana armed forces is the president of ghana , who is also the supreme military commander of the president's own guard regiment ( pogr ) and of the border guard unit ( bgu ) .
the supervision of the ghana armed forces ( gaf ) is managed by the minister of defence and the chief of defence staff .
the ghana armed forces ( gaf ) were formed in *num* .
major general stephen otu is appointed gaf chief of defence staff in september *num* .
from *num* , the gaf was extensively involved in politics , mounting several coups .
kwame nkrumah had become ghana's first prime minister when the country became independent in *num* .
as nkrumah's rule wore on , he began to take actions which disquieted the leadership of the armed forces , including the creation and expansion of the president's own guard regiment ( pogr ) .
as a result , on february *num* , *num* , a small number of army military personnel and senior police officials , led by colonel emmanuel kotoka , ( commander of the second army brigade at kumasi ) , major akwasi afrifa , ( staff officer in charge of army training and operations ) , lieutenant general ( retired ) joseph ankrah , and j .
w .
k .
harlley , ( the police inspector general ) , successfully launched " operation cold chop " , the *num* ghanaian coup d'état , against the nkrumah regime .
the group formed the national liberation council , which ruled ghana from *num* to *num* .
the gaf's second coup took place in *num* , after the reinstated civilian government cut military privileges and started changing the leadership of the army's combat units .
lieutenant colonel ignatius kutu acheampong ( temporary commander of the first brigade around accra ) led the bloodless *num* ghanaian coup d'état that ended the second republic in january *num* .
thus the national redemption council was formed .
acheampong became head of state , and the nrc ruled from *num* to *num* .
on october *num* , *num* , the nrc was replaced by the supreme military council ( smc ) .
council members were colonel acheampong , ( chairman , who was also promoted straight from colonel to general ) , lt .
gen .
fred akuffo , ( the chief of defence staff ) , and the army , navy , air force and border guard unit commanders .
in july *num* , in a sudden move , the other smc officers forced acheampong to resign , replacing him with lt .
gen .
akuffo .
the smc apparently acted in response to continuing pressure to find a solution to the country's economic dilemma ; inflation was estimated to be as high as *num* % that year .
the council was also motivated by acheampong's failure to dampen rising political pressure for changes .
akuffo , the new smc chairman , promised publicly to hand over political power to a new government to be elected by *num* july *num* .
the decree lifting the ban on party politics went into effect on *num* january *num* , as planned .
however in june , just before the scheduled resumption of civilian rule , a group of young armed forces officers , led by flight lieutenant jerry rawlings , mounted the *num* ghanaian coup d'état .
they put in place the armed forces revolutionary council , which governed until september *num* .
however , in *num* , rawlings deposed the new civilian government again , in the *num* ghanaian coup d'état .
this time rawlings established the provisional national defence council .
the pndc remained in government until january *num* , *num* .
in the last years of the pndc , jerry rawlings assumed civilian status ; he was elected as a civilian president in *num* and continued as president until *num* .
since the gaf ( ghana armed forces ) first external operation in the military operation congo ( onuc ) in the early 1960s , then the gaf training of rhodesian guerrillas , followed by the gaf have taken up their positions on the thin blue line between war and peace , amidst genocide and civil war in the successive decades .
gaf external operations within europe has been significantly to the balkans including the kosovo war with the gaf external operations within africa including the rwandan genocide ( unamir ) which in his book " shake hands with the devil " , canadian forces commander romeo dallaire gave the ga ( ghana army ) soldiers high praise for their work during the civil and conflict , and liberia civil war paving way for the accra comprehensive peace agreement among others .
gaf external operations within asia have included iran and iraq in the iran–iraq war , kuwait and lebanon civil war among others .
gaf ( ghana armed forces ) external operation and military operation presence was proudly advertised in the operations of cambodia−untac .
a total of *num* , *num* ga ( ghana army ) soldiers and *num* gmp ( ghana military police ) military police personnel from gaf ( ghana armed forces ) operated in untac laying to rest the chronic military confusion in cambodia .
the untac operation lasted two years , 1992−1993 .
after a long running cambodia civil war ignited by external interventions , a resolution was accepted by the four warring fractional parties .
operation untac was the gaf largest external operation since the gaf first external operation in military operation onuc .
operation untac and its contingent unamic had a combined budget of more than $1 .
*num* billion .
ghana armed forces ( gaf ) soldiers and ( gmp ) military police personnel from ga ( ghana army ) effectively contributed to bringing political and military to cambodia .
the ghana army ( ga ) is structured as follows : ghana's armed forces relies on a mix of technology .
modern m16s , ak-47s , type *num* assault rifles , ballistic vests and personal armor are standard issue , while much of the secondary equipment and military technology used by the army and air force are manufactured internally by the defence industries holding company ( dihoc ) .
external suppliers include russia , iran , and the people's republic of china .
gaf ( ghana armed forces ) is free to commit a large proportion of its armed forces to international peacekeeping operations .
such operations are mainly conducted in africa , while large ghanaian armed forces are frequently posted across the world as elements of united nations peacekeeping forces .
the united nations has often relied on ghanaian armed forces to conduct peacekeeping operations , in countries as diverse as afghanistan , iraq , kosovo , georgia , nepal , cambodia and lebanon .
currently , ghanaian armed forces are posted to united nations peacekeeping missions as follows : ghana armed forces provided the first force commander of the economic community of west african states monitoring group ( ecomog ) , lieutenant general arnold quainoo .
quainoo led the force from july *num* to september *num* .
as of the decade 2010s in the *ord* century the ghana armed forces peacekeepers have many roles : as military patrols ( patrolling ) , provosts ( military police ) , electoral observers , de-miners ( bomb disposal units and clearance divers ) , ceasefire monitors humanitarian aid workers , and even special forces or frogmen against rebel armies .
the ghana air force ( ghf ) is headquartered in burma camp accra , and operates from bases in accra ( main transport base ) , tamale ( combat and training base ) , sekondi-takoradi ( training base ) , and kumasi ( support base ) .
the ghf military doctrine and stated mission is to perform counterinsurgency operations within ghana or externally and to provide logistical support to the ghana army .
the ghana navy ( gn ) military doctrine and stated mission is to provide defence of ghana and its territorial waters , fishery protection , exclusive economic zone , and internal security on lake volta .
it is also tasked with resupplying ga ( ghana army ) peacekeepers in africa , fighting maritime criminal activities such as piracy , disaster and humanitarian relief operations , and evacuation of ghanaian citizens and other nationals from troubled spots .
in *num* the gn was re-organized into an eastern command , with headquarters at tema , and a western command , with headquarters at sekondi-takoradi .
the gaf ( ghana armed forces ) , in addition to owning its own arms industry weapons and military technology and equipment manufacturer ( dihoc − defence industries holding company ) , operates its own private bank .
the gaf military private bank is cited at burma camp and serves the gaf military personnels and their gaf civilian counterparts .
ghana armed forces has two military hospitals the kumasi military hospital in kumasi and the *num* military hospital in accra .
the *num* military hospital which has recently undergone expansion and its facilities include a twenty-four-hour emergency department ( ed ) .
the gaf main military hospital is also accredited for post-graduate medical education teaching .
the gaf main military hospital has been organized into working units or sub-units , which has created a good standard of structure within the facility .
the divisions and departments ( the units ) are developed and joined according to medical , paramedical and administrative lines and each of these units has its own departmental head .
the gaf military hospital is staffed by gaf military personnel and also houses a medical education training facility .
vyacheslav lebedev , chairman of the supreme court of russia showed gratitude to the gaf ( ghana armed forces ) following vyacheslav lebedev emergency treatment at the gaf *num* military hospital .
the gaf ( ghana army ) operates the gaf cadet corps for gaf cadets whom go on to military education and training and recruit training graduation from the gaf military academy for army recruit and seaman recruit prior to enlistment into the military branches of the gaf ( ghana armed forces ) : paramilitary forces ( gaf military branch : border guard unit − bgu ) deal with preventing and controlling civil disturbances and insurrection .
ghanaian statutory law officially prohibits civilians and foreign nationals from wearing military apparel such as camouflage clothing , or clothing which resembles military dress .
officially , fines and / or short prison sentences can be passed against civilians seen in military dress in public .
in addition , ghanaian law prohibits the photographing of ghana armed forces ( gaf ) ghana military police ( gmp ) police or gaf military personnel and vehicles while on duty , strategic sites such as kotoka international airport when in use , and the seat of the ghanaian government , the flagstaff house .
in *num* , gaf ( ghana armed forces ) agreed closer military cooperation with the china people's liberation army , and in *num* , gaf agreed closer military cooperation with the armed forces of the islamic republic of iran ) and gaf agreed to closer military cooperation with the armed forces of the russian federation ) in *num* .
ancyra ( genus ) ancyra is a genus of southeast asian planthoppers .
members of the genus are well known for having a pair of prolonged filaments at the tips of the forewings that arise near a pair of small glossy spots ; this creates the impression of a pair of antennae , with corresponding " eyes " ( a remarkable case of automimicry ) .
the " false head " effect is further reinforced by the bugs ' habit of walking backwards when it detects movement nearby , so as to misdirect predators to strike at its rear , rather than at its actual head .
anatolia anatolia ( from greek ' ; " east " or " [ sun ] rise " ) , also known as asia minor ( medieval and modern greek : ' , " small asia " ; ) , asian turkey , the anatolian peninsula , or the anatolian plateau , is the westernmost protrusion of asia , which makes up the majority of modern-day turkey .
the region is bounded by the black sea to the north , the mediterranean sea to the south , the armenian highlands to the east , and the aegean sea to the west .
the sea of marmara forms a connection between the black and aegean seas through the bosphorus and dardanelles straits and separates anatolia from thrace on the european mainland .
the eastern border of anatolia is traditionally held to be a line between the gulf of alexandretta and the black sea , bounded by the armenian highland to the east and mesopotamia to the southeast .
thus , traditionally anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the asian part of turkey .
nowadays , anatolia is also often considered to be synonymous with asian turkey , which comprises almost the entire country ; its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be turkey's eastern border .
by some definitions , the area called the armenian highlands lies beyond the boundary of the anatolian plateau .
the official name of this inland region is the eastern anatolia region .
the ancient inhabitants of anatolia spoke the now-extinct anatolian languages , which were largely replaced by the greek language starting from classical antiquity and during the hellenistic , roman and byzantine periods .
major anatolian languages included hittite , luwian , and lydian among other more poorly attested relatives .
the turkification of anatolia began under the seljuk empire in the late *ord* century and continued under the ottoman empire between the late *ord* and early *ord* centuries .
however , various non-turkic languages continue to be spoken by minorities in anatolia today , including kurdish , neo-aramaic , armenian , arabic , laz , georgian and greek .
other ancient peoples in the region included galatians , hurrians , assyrians , hattians , cimmerians , as well as ionian , dorian , and aeolian greeks .
traditionally , anatolia is considered to extend in the east to an indefinite line running from the gulf of alexandretta to the black sea , coterminous with the anatolian plateau .
this traditional geographical definition is used , for example , in the latest edition of " merriam-webster's geographical dictionary " , under this definition , anatolia is bounded to the east by the armenian highlands , and the euphrates before that river bends to the southeast to enter mesopotamia .
to the southeast , it is bounded by the ranges that separate it from the orontes valley in syria ( region ) and the mesopotamian plain .
following the armenian genocide , ottoman armenia was renamed " eastern anatolia " by the newly established turkish government .
vazken davidian terms the expanded use of " anatolia " to apply to territory formerly referred to as armenia an " ahistorical imposition " , and notes that a growing body of literature is uncomfortable with referring to the ottoman east as " eastern anatolia " .
most archeological sources consider the boundary of anatolia to be turkey's eastern border .
the highest mountains in anatolia are mount süphan ( *num* m ) and mount ararat ( *num* m ) .
the euphrates , araxes karasu and murat rivers connect the anatolian plateau to the south caucasus and the upper euphrates valley .
along with the çoruh , these rivers are the longest in anatolia .
the oldest known reference to anatolia – as “land of the hatti” – appears on mesopotamian cuneiform tablets from the period of the akkadian empire ( 2350–2150 bc ) .
the first recorded name the greeks used for the anatolian peninsula , ἀσία ( asía ) , presumably echoed the name of the assuwa league in western anatolia .
as the name " asia " broadened its scope to apply to other areas east of the mediterranean , greeks in late antiquity came to use the name μικρὰ ἀσία ( " mikrá asía " ) or asia minor , meaning " lesser asia " to refer to present-day anatolia .
the english-language name " anatolia " itself derives from the greek ( " " ) meaning “the east” or more literally “sunrise” ( comparable to the latin-derived terms " levant " and " orient " ) .
the precise reference of this term has varied over time , perhaps originally referring to the aeolian , ionian and dorian colonies on the west coast of asia minor .
in the byzantine empire , the anatolic theme ( ἀνατολικόν θέμα ) was a " theme " covering the western and central parts of turkey's present-day central anatolia region .
the term " anatolia " is medieval latin .
the modern turkish form of anatolia , " anadolu " , derives from the greek name aνατολή ( " anatolḗ " ) .
the russian male name anatoly and the french anatole share the same linguistic origin .
the term " anatolia " originally referred to a northwestern byzantine province .
by the *ord* century europeans had started referring to anatolia as " turchia " .
it has historically also been called " asia minor " .
in earlier times , it was called " ( land of the ) rûm " by both the greeks and the seljuqs .
during the era of the ottoman empire mapmakers outside the empire referred to the mountainous plateau in eastern anatolia as armenia .
other contemporary sources called the same area kurdistan .
geographers have variously used the terms east anatolian plateau and armenian plateau to refer to the region , although the territory encompassed by each term largely overlaps with the other .
according to archaeologist lori khatchadourian this difference in terminology " primarily result [ s ] from the shifting political fortunes and cultural trajectories of the region since the nineteenth century .
" turkey's first geography congress in *num* created two regions to the east of the gulf of iskenderun-black sea line named the eastern anatolia region and the southeastern anatolia region , the former largely corresponding to the western part of the armenian highland , the latter to the northern part of the mesopotamian plain .
according to richard hovannisian this changing of toponyms was " necessary to obscure all evidence " of armenian presence as part of a campaign of genocide denial embarked upon by the newly established turkish government and what hovannisian calls its " foreign collaborators " .
human habitation in anatolia dates back to the paleolithic .
neolithic anatolia has been proposed as the homeland of the indo-european language family , although linguists tend to favour a later origin in the steppes north of the black sea .
however , it is clear that the anatolian languages , the earliest attested branch of indo-european , have been spoken in anatolia since at least the *ord* century bc .
the earliest historical records of anatolia stem from the southeast of the region and are from the mesopotamian-based akkadian empire during the reign of sargon of akkad in the *ord* century bc .
scholars generally believe the earliest indigenous populations of anatolia were the hattians and hurrians .
the hattians spoke a language of unclear affiliation , and the hurrian language belongs to a small family called hurro-urartian , all these languages now being extinct ; relationships with indigenous languages of the caucasus have been proposed but are not generally accepted .
the region was famous for exporting raw materials , and areas of hattian- and hurrian-populated southeast anatolia were colonised by the akkadians .
after the fall of the akkadian empire in the *ord* century bc , the assyrians , who were the northern branch of the akkadian people , colonised parts of the region between the *ord* and *ord* centuries bc and claimed its resources , notably silver .
one of the numerous cuneiform records dated circa *ord* century bc , found in anatolia at the assyrian colony of kanesh , uses an advanced system of trading computations and credit lines .
unlike the akkadians and their descendants , the assyrians , whose anatolian possessions were peripheral to their core lands in mesopotamia , the hittites were centred at hattusa ( modern boğazkale ) in north-central anatolia by the *ord* century bc .
they were speakers of an indo-european language , the hittite language , or " nesili " ( the language of nesa ) in hittite .
the hittites originated of local ancient cultures that grew in anatolia , in addition to the arrival of indo-european languages .
attested for the first time in the assyrian tablets of nesa around 2000bc , they conquered hattusa in the *ord* century bc , imposing themselves over hattian- and hurrian-speaking populations .
according to the widely accepted kurgan theory on the proto-indo-european homeland , however , the hittites ( along with the other indo-european ancient anatolians ) were themselves relatively recent immigrants to anatolia from the north .
however , they did not necessarily displace the population genetically , they would rather assimilate into the former peoples ' culture , preserving the hittite language however .
the hittites adopted the cuneiform script , invented in mesopotamia .
during the late bronze age circa *num* bc , they created a kingdom , the hittite new kingdom , which became an empire in the *ord* century bc after the conquest of kizzuwatna in the south-east and the defeat of the assuwa league in western anatolia .
the empire reached its height in the *ord* century bc , controlling much of asia minor , northwestern syria and northwest upper mesopotamia .
they failed to reach the anatolian coasts of the black sea , however , as a non-indo-european people , the semi-nomadic pastoralist and tribal kaskians , had established themselves there , displacing earlier palaic-speaking indo-europeans .
much of the history of the hittite empire concerned war with the rival empires of egypt , assyria and the mitanni .
the egyptians eventually withdrew from the region after failing to gain the upper hand over the hittites and becoming wary of the power of assyria , which had destroyed the mitanni empire .
the assyrians and hittites were then left to battle over control of eastern and southern anatolia and colonial territories in syria .
the assyrians had better success than the egyptians , annexing much hittite ( and hurrian ) territory in these regions .
after *num* bc , during the late bronze age collapse , the hittite empire disintegrated into several independent syro-hittite states , subsequent to losing much territory to the middle assyrian empire and being finally overrun by the phrygians , another indo-european people who are believed to have migrated from the balkans .
the phrygian expansion into southeast anatolia was eventually halted by the assyrians , who controlled that region .
arameans encroached over the borders of south central anatolia in the century or so after the fall of the hittite empire , and some of the syro-hittite states in this region became an amalgam of hittites and arameans .
these became known as syro-hittite states .
in central and western anatolia , another indo-european people , the luwians , came to the fore , circa *num* bc .
their language belonged to the same anatolic clade as the hittite .
the general consensus amongst scholars is that luwian was spoken—to a greater or lesser degree—across a large area of western anatolia , including ( possibly ) wilusa ( troy ) , the seha river land ( to be identified with the hermos and / or kaikos valley ) , and the kingdom of mira-kuwaliya with its core territory of the maeander valley .
from the *ord* century bc , luwian regions coalesced into a number of states such as lydia , caria and lycia , all of which had hellenic influence .
from the *ord* to late *ord* centuries bc , much of anatolia ( particularly the southeastern regions ) fell to the neo-assyrian empire , including all of the syro-hittite states , tabal , kingdom of commagene , the cimmerians and scythians and swathes of cappadocia .
the neo-assyrian empire collapsed due to a bitter series of civil wars followed by a combined attack by medes , persians , scythians and their own babylonian relations .
the last assyrian city to fall was harran in southeast anatolia .
this city was the birthplace of the last king of babylon , the assyrian nabonidus and his son and regent belshazzar .
much of the region then fell to the short-lived iran-based median empire , with the babylonians and scythians briefly appropriating some territory .
from the late *ord* century bc , a new wave of indo-european-speaking raiders entered northern and northeast anatolia : the cimmerians and scythians .
the cimmerians overran phrygia and the scythians threatened to do the same to urartu and lydia , before both were finally checked by the assyrians .
the north-western coast of anatolia was inhabited by greeks of the achaean / mycenaean culture from the *ord* century bc , related to the greeks of south eastern europe and the aegean .
beginning with the bronze age collapse at the end of the *ord* millennium bc , the west coast of anatolia was settled by ionian greeks , usurping the area of the related but earlier mycenaean greeks .
over several centuries , numerous ancient greek city-states were established on the coasts of anatolia .
greeks started western philosophy on the western coast of anatolia ( pre-socratic philosophy ) .
in classical antiquity , anatolia was described by herodotus and later historians as divided into regions that were diverse in culture , language and religious practices .
the northern regions included bithynia , paphlagonia and pontus ; to the west were mysia , lydia and caria ; and lycia , pamphylia and cilicia belonged to the southern shore .
there were also several inland regions : phrygia , cappadocia , pisidia and galatia .
anatolia is known as the birthplace of minted coinage ( as opposed to unminted coinage , which first appears in mesopotamia at a much earlier date ) as a medium of exchange , some time in the *ord* century bc in lydia .
the use of minted coins continued to flourish during the greek and roman eras .
during the *ord* century bc , all of anatolia was conquered by the persian achaemenid empire , the persians having usurped the medes as the dominant dynasty in iran .
in *num* bc , the ionian city-states on the west coast of anatolia rebelled against persian rule .
the ionian revolt , as it became known , though quelled , initiated the greco-persian wars , which ended in a greek victory in *num* bc , and the ionian cities regained their independence , alongside the withdrawal of the persian forces from their european territories .
in *num* bc , the macedonian greek king alexander the great conquered the peninsula from the achaemenid persian empire .
alexander's conquest opened up the interior of asia minor to greek settlement and influence .
following the death of alexander and the breakup of his empire , anatolia was ruled by a series of hellenistic kingdoms , such as the attalids of pergamum and the seleucids , the latter controlling most of anatolia .
a period of peaceful hellenization followed , such that the local anatolian languages had been supplanted by greek by the *ord* century bc .
in *num* bc the last attalid king bequeathed his kingdom to the roman republic , and western and central anatolia came under roman control , but hellenistic culture remained predominant .
further annexations by rome , in particular of the kingdom of pontus by pompey , brought all of anatolia under roman control , except for the eastern frontier with the parthian empire , which remained unstable for centuries , causing a series of wars , culminating in the roman-parthian wars .
after the division of the roman empire , anatolia became part of the east roman , or byzantine empire .
anatolia was one of the first places where christianity spread , so that by the *ord* century ad , western and central anatolia were overwhelmingly christian and greek-speaking .
for the next *num* years , while imperial possessions in europe were subjected to barbarian invasions , anatolia would be the center of the hellenic world .
it was one of the wealthiest and most densely populated places in the late roman empire .
anatolia's wealth grew during the *ord* and *ord* centuries thanks , in part , to the pilgrim's road that ran through the peninsula .
literary evidence about the rural landscape has come down to us from the hagiographies of *ord* century nicholas of sion and *ord* century theodore of sykeon .
large urban centers included ephesus , pergamum , sardis and aphrodisias .
scholars continue to debate the cause of urban decline in the *ord* and *ord* centuries variously attributing it to the plague of justinian ( *num* ) , and the *ord* century persian incursion and arab conquest of the levant .
in the ninth and tenth century a resurgent byzantine empire regained its lost territories , including even long lost territory such as armenia and syria ( ancient aram ) .
in the *num* years following the battle of manzikert in *num* , the seljuk turks from central asia migrated over large areas of anatolia , with particular concentrations around the northwestern rim .
the turkish language and the islamic religion were gradually introduced as a result of the seljuk conquest , and this period marks the start of anatolia's slow transition from predominantly christian and greek-speaking , to predominantly muslim and turkish-speaking ( although ethnic groups such as armenians , greeks , and assyrians remained numerous and retained christianity and their native languages ) .
in the following century , the byzantines managed to reassert their control in western and northern anatolia .
control of anatolia was then split between the byzantine empire and the seljuk sultanate of rûm , with the byzantine holdings gradually being reduced .
in *num* , the mongols swept through eastern and central anatolia , and would remain until *num* .
the ilkhanate garrison was stationed near ankara .
after the decline of the ilkhanate from 1335–1353 , the mongol empire's legacy in the region was the uyghur eretna dynasty that was overthrown by kadi burhan al-din in *num* .
by the end of the *ord* century , most of anatolia was controlled by various anatolian beyliks .
smyrna fell in *num* , and the last byzantine stronghold in anatolia , philadelphia , fell in *num* .
the turkmen beyliks were under the control of the mongols , at least nominally , through declining seljuk sultans .
the beyliks did not mint coins in the names of their own leaders while they remained under the suzerainty of the mongol ilkhanids .
the osmanli ruler osman i was the first turkish ruler who minted coins in his own name in 1320s , for it bears the legend " minted by osman son of ertugrul " .
since the minting of coins was a prerogative accorded in islamic practice only to a sovereign , it can be considered that the osmanli , or ottoman turks , became formally independent from the mongol khans .
among the turkish leaders , the ottomans emerged as great power under osman i and his son orhan i .
the anatolian beyliks were successively absorbed into the rising ottoman empire during the *ord* century .
it is not well understood how the osmanlı , or ottoman turks , came to dominate their neighbours , as the history of medieval anatolia is still little known .
the ottomans completed the conquest of the peninsula in *num* with the taking of halicarnassus ( modern bodrum ) from the knights of saint john .
with the acceleration of the decline of the ottoman empire in the early *ord* century , and as a result of the expansionist policies of the russian empire in the caucasus , many muslim nations and groups in that region , mainly circassians , tatars , azeris , lezgis , chechens and several turkic groups left their homelands and settled in anatolia .
as the ottoman empire further shrank in the balkan regions and then fragmented during the balkan wars , much of the non-christian populations of its former possessions , mainly balkan muslims ( bosnian muslims , albanians , turks , muslim bulgarians and greek muslims such as the vallahades from greek macedonia ) , were resettled in various parts of anatolia , mostly in formerly christian villages throughout anatolia .
a continuous reverse migration occurred since the early *ord* century , when greeks from anatolia , constantinople and pontus area migrated toward the newly independent kingdom of greece , and also towards the united states , southern part of the russian empire , latin america and rest of europe .
following the russo-persian treaty of turkmenchay ( *num* ) and the incorporation of the eastern armenia into the russian empire , another migration involved the large armenian population of anatolia , which recorded significant migration rates from western armenia ( eastern anatolia ) toward the russian empire , especially toward its newly established armenian provinces .
anatolia remained multi-ethnic until the early *ord* century ( see the rise of nationalism under the ottoman empire ) .
during world war i , the armenian genocide , the greek genocide ( especially in pontus ) , and the assyrian genocide almost entirely removed the ancient indigenous communities of armenian , greek , and assyrian populations in anatolia and surrounding regions .
following the greco-turkish war of 1919–1922 , most remaining ethnic anatolian greeks were forced out during the *num* population exchange between greece and turkey .
many more have left turkey since , leaving fewer than *num* , *num* greeks in anatolia today .
since the foundation of the republic of turkey in *num* , anatolia has been within turkey , its inhabitants being mainly turks and kurds ( see demographics of turkey and history of turkey ) .
anatolia's terrain is structurally complex .
a central massif composed of uplifted blocks and downfolded troughs , covered by recent deposits and giving the appearance of a plateau with rough terrain , is wedged between two folded mountain ranges that converge in the east .
true lowland is confined to a few narrow coastal strips along the aegean , mediterranean , and black sea coasts .
flat or gently sloping land is rare and largely confined to the deltas of the kızıl river , the coastal plains of çukurova and the valley floors of the gediz river and the büyük menderes river as well as some interior high plains in anatolia , mainly around lake tuz ( salt lake ) and the konya basin ( " konya ovasi " ) .
there are two mountain ranges in southern anatolia : the taurus and the zagros mountains .
anatolia has a varied range of climates .
the central plateau is characterized by a continental climate , with hot summers and cold snowy winters .
the south and west coasts enjoy a typical mediterranean climate , with mild rainy winters , and warm dry summers .
the black sea and marmara coasts have a temperate oceanic climate , with cool foggy summers and much rainfall throughout the year .
there is a diverse number of plant and animal communities .
the mountains and coastal plain of northern anatolia experiences humid and mild climate .
there are temperate broadleaf , mixed and coniferous forests .
the central and eastern plateau , with its drier continental climate , has deciduous forests and forest steppes .
western and southern anatolia , which have a mediterranean climate , contain mediterranean forests , woodlands , and scrub ecoregions .
almost *num* % of the people currently residing in anatolia are turks .
kurds constitute a major community in southeastern anatolia , and are the largest ethnic minority .
abkhazians , albanians , arabs , arameans , armenians , assyrians , azerbaijanis , bosnian muslims , circassians , gagauz , georgians , serbs , greeks , hemshin , jews , laz , levantines , pomaks , zazas and a number of other ethnic groups also live in anatolia in smaller numbers .
bamia is a traditional anatolian-era stew dish prepared using lamb , okra and tomatoes as primary ingredients .
epistle to the romans the epistle to the romans or letter to the romans , often shortened to romans , is the sixth book in the new testament .
biblical scholars agree that it was composed by the apostle paul to explain that salvation is offered through the gospel of jesus christ .
it is the longest of the pauline epistles .
in the opinion of jesuit scholar joseph fitzmyer , the book " overwhelms the reader by the density and sublimity of the topic with which it deals , the gospel of the justification and salvation of jew and greek alike by the grace of god through faith in jesus christ , revealing the uprightness and love of god the father .

wright notes that romans is the scholarly consensus is that paul wrote the epistle to the romans .
c .
e .
b .
cranfield , in the introduction to his commentary on romans , says : the denial of paul's authorship of romans by such critics .
.
.
is now rightly relegated to a place among the curiosities of nt scholarship .
today no responsible criticism disputes its pauline origin .
the evidence of its use in the apostolic fathers is clear , and before the end of the second century it is listed and cited as paul's .
every extant early list of nt books includes it among his letters .
the external evidence of authenticity could indeed hardly be stronger ; and it is altogether borne out by the internal evidence , linguistic , stylistic , literary , historical and theological .
the letter was most probably written while paul was in corinth , probably while he was staying in the house of gaius , and transcribed by tertius , his amanuensis .
there are a number of reasons why corinth is considered most plausible .
paul was about to travel to jerusalem on writing the letter , which matches acts where it is reported that paul stayed for three months in greece .
this probably implies corinth as it was the location of paul's greatest missionary success in greece .
additionally , phoebe was a deacon of the church in cenchreae , a port to the east of corinth , and would have been able to convey the letter to rome after passing through corinth and taking a ship from corinth's west port .
erastus , mentioned in , also lived in corinth , being the city's commissioner for public works and city treasurer at various times , again indicating that the letter was written in corinth .
the precise time at which it was written is not mentioned in the epistle , but it was obviously written when the collection for jerusalem had been assembled and paul was about to " go unto jerusalem to minister unto the saints " , that is , at the close of his second visit to greece , during the winter preceding his last visit to that city .
the majority of scholars writing on romans propose the letter was written in late *num* / early *num* or late *num* / early *num* .
early *num* and early *num* both have some support , while german new testament scholar gerd lüdemann argues for a date as early as *num* / *num* ( or *num* / *num* ) , following on from knox , who proposed *num* / *num* .
lüdemann is the only serious challenge to the consensus of mid to late 50s .
some manuscripts have a subscription at the end of the epistle : for ten years before writing the letter ( approx .
47–57 ) , paul had traveled around the territories bordering the aegean sea evangelizing .
churches had been planted in the roman provinces of galatia , macedonia , achaia and asia .
paul , considering his task complete , wanted to preach the gospel in spain , where he would not " build upon another man’s foundation " .
this allowed him to visit rome on the way , a long-time ambition of his .
the letter to the romans , in part , prepares them and gives reasons for his visit .
in addition to paul's geographic location , his religious views are important .
first , paul was a hellenistic jew with a pharisaic background ( see gamaliel ) , integral to his identity : see paul the apostle and judaism for details .
his concern for his people is one part of the dialogue and runs throughout the letter .
second , the other side of the dialogue is paul's conversion and calling to follow christ in the early 30s .
the most probable ancient account of the beginning of christianity in rome is given by a 4th-century writer known as ambrosiaster : from adam clarke : at this time , the jews made up a substantial number in rome , and their synagogues , frequented by many , enabled the gentiles to become acquainted with the story of jesus of nazareth .
consequently , churches composed of both jews and gentiles were formed at rome .
according to irenaeus , a 2nd-century church father , the church at rome was founded directly by the apostles peter and paul .
however , many modern scholars disagree with irenaeus , holding that while little is known of the circumstances of the church's founding , it was not founded by paul : note the large number of names in of those then in rome , and verses *num* , *num* and *num* indicate there was more than one church assembly or company of believers in rome .
verse *num* mentions a church that met in the house of aquila and priscilla .
verses *num* and *num* each mention groupings of believers and saints .
jews were expelled from rome because of disturbances around ad *num* by the edict of claudius .
fitzmyer claims that both jews and jewish christians were expelled as a result of their infighting .
claudius died around the year ad *num* , and his successor , emperor nero , allowed the jews back into rome , but then , after the great fire of rome of *num* , christians were persecuted .
fitzmyer argues that with the return of the jews to rome in *num* new conflict arose between the gentile christians and the jewish christians who had formerly been expelled .
keck thinks gentile christians may have developed a dislike of or looked down on jews ( see also antisemitism and responsibility for the death of jesus ) , because they theologically rationalized that jews were no longer god's people .
scholars often have difficulty assessing whether romans is a letter or an epistle , a relevant distinction in form-critical analysis : a letter is something non-literary , a means of communication between persons who are separated from each other .
confidential and personal in nature , it is intended only for the person or persons to whom it is addressed , and not at all for the public or any kind of publicity .
.
.
an epistle is an artistic literary form , just like the dialogue , the oration , or the drama .
it has nothing in common with the letter except its form : apart from that one might venture the paradox that the epistle is the opposite of a real letter .
the contents of the epistle are intended for publicity—they aim at interesting " the public .
" joseph fitzmyer argues , from evidence put forth by stirewalt , that the style of romans is an " essay-letter .
" / philip melanchthon , a writer during the reformation , suggested that romans was " caput et summa universae doctrinae christianae " ( " a summary of all christian doctrine " ) .
while some scholars suggest , like melanchthon , that it is a type of theological treatise , this view largely ignores chapters *num* and *num* of romans .
there are also many " noteworthy elements " missing from romans that are included in other areas of the pauline corpus .
the breakdown of romans as a treatise began with f .
c .
baur in *num* when he suggested " this letter had to be interpreted according to the historical circumstances in which paul wrote it .
" paul sometimes uses a style of writing common in his time called a " diatribe " .
he appears to be responding to a " heckler " ( probably an imaginary one based on paul's encounters with real objections in his previous preaching ) , and the letter is structured as a series of arguments .
in the flow of the letter , paul shifts his arguments , sometimes addressing the jewish members of the church , sometimes the gentile membership and sometimes the church as a whole .
to review the current scholarly viewpoints on the purpose of romans , along with a bibliography , see " dictionary of paul and his letters " .
for a 16th-century " lollard " reformer view , see the work of william tyndale .
in his prologue to his translation of the book of romans , which was largely taken from the prologue of german reformer martin luther , tyndale writes that : .
.
.
this epistle is the principal and most excellent part of the new testament , and most pure evangelion , that is to say glad tidings and what we call the gospel , and also a light and a way in unto the whole scripture .
.
.
the sum and whole cause of the writings of this epistle , is , to prove that a man is justified by faith only : which proposition whoso denieth , to him is not only this epistle and all that paul writeth , but also the whole scripture , so locked up that he shall never understand it to his soul's health .
and to bring a man to the understanding and feeling that faith only justifieth , paul proveth that the whole nature of man is so poisoned and so corrupt , yea and so dead concerning godly living or godly thinking , that it is impossible for her to keep the law in the sight of god .
this essay-letter composed by paul was written to a specific audience at a specific time ; to understand it , the situations of both paul and the recipients must be understood .
the introduction provides some general notes about paul .
he introduces here and introductory notes about the gospel he wishes to preach to the church at rome .
jesus ' human line stems from david .
paul , however , does not limit his ministry to jews .
paul's goal is that the gentiles would also hear the gospel .
he commends the romans for their faith .
paul also speaks of the past obstacles that have blocked his coming to rome earlier .
paul's announcement that he is not " ashamed " ( " epaiscúnomai " ) of his gospel because it holds power ( " dúnamis " ) .
these two verses form a backdrop for the rest of the book .
first , we note that paul is unashamed of his love for this gospel that he preaches about jesus christ .
he also notes that he is speaking to the " jew first .
" there is significance to this , but much of it is scholarly conjecture as the relationship of paul the apostle and judaism is still debated .
we are hard-pressed to find an answer to such a question without knowing more about the audience in question .
wayne brindle argues , based on paul's former writings against the judaizers in galatians and *num* corinthians , that rumors had probably spread about paul totally negating the jewish existence in a christian world ( see also antinomianism in the new testament and supersessionism ) .
paul may have used the " jew first " approach to counter such a view .
paul now begins into the main thrust of his letter .
he begins by suggesting that humans have taken up ungodliness and wickedness for which there will be wrath from god .
people have taken god's invisible image and made him into an idol .
paul draws heavily here from the wisdom of solomon .
he condemns unnatural sexual behavior and warns that such behavior will result in a depraved body and mind ( " reprobate mind " in the king james version ) and says that people who do such things ( including murder and wickedness ) are worthy of death .
paul stands firmly against the idol worship system which was common in rome .
several scholars believe the passage is a non-pauline interpolation .
on the traditional protestant interpretation , paul here calls out jews who are condemning others for not following the law when they themselves are also not following the law .
stanley stowers , however , has argued on rhetorical grounds that paul is in these verses not addressing a jew at all but rather an easily recognizable caricature of the typical boastful person ( ὁ ἀλαζων ) .
stowers writes , " there is absolutely no justification for reading as paul's attack on ' the hypocrisy of the jew .
' no one in the first century would have identified " ho alazon " with judaism .
that popular interpretation depends upon anachronistically reading later christian characterizations of jews as ' hypocritical pharisees' " .
see also anti-judaism .
paul says that a righteousness from god has made itself known apart from the law , to which the law and prophets testify , and this righteousness from god comes through faith in jesus to all who believe .
he describes justification – legally clearing the believer of the guilt and penalty of sin – as a gift of god , and not the work of man ( lest he might boast ) , but by faith .
in chapters five through eight , paul argues that believers can be assured of their hope in salvation , having been freed from the bondage of sin .
paul teaches that through faith , the faithful have been joined with jesus and freed from sin .
believers should celebrate in the assurance of salvation and be certain that no external force or party can take their salvation away from them .
this promise is open to everyone since everyone has sinned , save the one who paid for all of them .
in paul addresses the faithfulness of god to the israelites , where he says that god has been faithful to his promise .
paul hopes that all israelites will come to realize the truth since he himself is also an israelite , and had in the past been a persecutor of early christians .
in paul talks about how the nation of israel has been cast away , and the conditions under which israel will be god's chosen nation again : when israel returns to its faith , sets aside its unbelief .
in , paul says that humans are under the law while we live : " know ye not .
.
.
that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth ? " however , jesus ' death on the cross makes believers dead to the law ( , " wherefore , my brethren , ye are also become dead to the law by the body of christ " ) , according to an antinomistic interpretation .
from chapter *num* through the first part of chapter *num* , paul outlines how the gospel transforms believers and the behaviour that results from such a transformation .
this transformation is described as a " renewing of your mind " ( *num* : *num* ) , a transformation that douglas j .
moo characterizes as “the heart of the matter .
” it is a transformation so radical that it amounts to “a transfiguration of your brain , ” a " metanoia " , a “mental revolution .
” paul goes on to describe how believers should live .
christians are no longer under the law , that is , no longer bound by the law of moses , but under the grace of god , see law and grace .
we do not need to live under the law because to the extent our minds have been renewed , we will know " almost instinctively " what god wants of us .
the law then provides an " objective standard " for judging progress in the " lifelong process " of our mind's renewal .
to the extent they have been set free from sin by renewed minds ( romans *num* : *num* ) , believers are no longer bound to sin .
believers are free to live in obedience to god and love everybody .
as paul says in romans *num* : *num* , " love ( ἀγάπη ) worketh no ill to his neighbor : therefore love is the fulfilling of law " .
the fragment in romans *num* : 1–7 dealing with obedience to earthly powers is considered by some , for example james kallas , to be an interpolation .
( see also the great commandment and christianity and politics ) .
paul tillich accepts the historical authenticity of romans *num* : 1–7 , but claims it has been misinterpreted by churches with an anti-revolutionary bias : one of the many politico-theological abuses of biblical statements is the understanding of paul’s words [ romans *num* : 1–7 ] as justifying the anti-revolutionary bias of some churches , particularly the lutheran .
but neither these words nor any other new testament statement deals with the methods of gaining political power .
in romans , paul is addressing eschatological enthusiasts , not a revolutionary political movement .
the concluding verses contain a description of his travel plans , personal greetings and salutations .
one-third of the twenty-one christians identified in the greetings are women .
additionally , none of these christians answer to the name peter , although according to the catholic tradition , he had been ruling as pope in rome for about *num* years .
possibly related was the incident at antioch between paul and cephas .
roman catholics accept the necessity of faith for salvation but point to for the necessity of living a virtuous life as well : but by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when god's righteous judgment will be revealed .
for he will render to every man according to his works : to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality , he will give eternal life ; but for those who are factious and do not obey the truth , but obey wickedness , there will be wrath and fury .
there will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil , the jew first and also the greek , but glory and honor and peace for every one who does good , the jew first and also the greek .
for god shows no partiality .
throughout his writings , st .
augustine strongly affirms the catholic understanding of this and other such scriptural admonitions .
in his sermons to his catholic congregations , he is especially careful to warn them against an inordinate desire for a complete assurance of salvation .
in his " exposition of psalm *num* " for example , he states : the gospel warned us , " be on the watch for the last day , the day when the son of man will come , " because it will spell disaster for those it finds secure as they are now – secure for the wrong reasons , i mean , secure in the pleasures of this world , when they ought to be secure only when they have " dominated this world's lusts " .
the apostle certainly prepares us for that future life in words of which i also reminded you on that occasion .
again , in his " exposition of psalm *num* " , augustine is perhaps even more specific : let us not expect security while we are on pilgrimage .
when we do find ourselves wanting it , what we are looking for is bodily sluggishness rather than personal security .
catholics would also look to the passage in romans *num* : *num* for evidence that justification by faith is only valid so long as it is combined with obedient cooperation with the holy spirit , and the passage in romans *num* : *num* to show that the christian can lose their justification if they turn away from cooperating with the holy spirit and reject christ through mortal sin .
in the protestant interpretation , the new testament epistles ( including romans ) , describes salvation as coming from faith and not from righteous actions .
for example , romans ( underlining added ) : they also point out that in romans , paul says that god will reward those who follow the law and then goes on to say that " no one " follows the law perfectly ( see also sermon on the mount : interpretation ) romans : martin luther described paul's letter to the romans as " the most important piece in the new testament .
it is purest gospel .
it is well worth a christian's while not only to memorize it word for word but also to occupy himself with it daily , as though it were the daily bread of the soul " .
luther controversially added the word " alone " ( " allein " in german ) to romans so that it read : " thus , we hold , then , that man is justified without doing the works of the law , " alone " through faith " .
the word " alone " does not appear in the original greek text , but luther defended his translation by maintaining that the adverb " alone " was required both by idiomatic german and paul's intended meaning .
this is a " "literalist view" " rather than a literal view of the bible .
apologist james swan lists numerous catholic sources that also translated romans *num* : *num* with the word " alone , " or testified to others doing so before luther .
a bible commentary published in *num* reports that : the " romans road " ( or " roman road " ) refers to a set of scriptures from romans that christian evangelists use to present a clear and simple case for personal salvation to each person , as all the verses are contained in one single book , making it easier for evangelism without going back and forth through the entire new testament .
the core verses used by nearly all groups using " romans road " are : romans , , , , and .
romans has been at the forefront of several major movements in protestantism .
martin luther's lectures on romans in 1515–1516 probably coincided with the development of his criticism of roman catholicism which led to the *num* theses of *num* .
in *num* , while hearing luther's preface to the epistle to the romans read at st .
botolph church on aldersgate street in london , john wesley famously felt his heart " strangely warmed " , a conversion experience which is often seen as the beginning of methodism .
in *num* karl barth's commentary on romans , " the epistle to the romans " , was the publication which is widely seen as the beginning of neo-orthodoxy .
carolina panthers the carolina panthers are a professional american football team based in charlotte , north carolina .
the panthers compete in the national football league ( nfl ) , as a member club of the league's national football conference ( nfc ) south division .
the team is headquartered in bank of america stadium in uptown charlotte ; also the team's home field .
they are one of the few nfl teams to own the stadium they play in , which is legally registered as panthers stadium , llc .
the panthers are supported throughout the carolinas ; although the team has played its home games in charlotte since *num* , it played home games at memorial stadium in clemson , south carolina during its first season .
the team hosts its annual training camp at wofford college in spartanburg , south carolina .
the head coach is ron rivera .
the panthers were announced as the league's *ord* franchise in *num* , and began play in *num* under original owner and founder jerry richardson .
the panthers played well in their first two years , finishing in *num* ( an all-time best for an nfl expansion team's first season ) and 12–4 the following year , winning the nfc west before ultimately losing to the eventual super bowl champion green bay packers in the nfc championship game .
they did not have another winning season until *num* , when they won the nfc championship game and reached super bowl xxxviii , losing 32–29 to the new england patriots .
after recording playoff appearances in *num* and *num* , the team failed to record another playoff appearance until *num* , the first of three consecutive nfc south titles .
after losing in the divisional round to the san francisco 49ers in *num* and the seattle seahawks in *num* , the panthers returned to the super bowl in *num* , but lost to the denver broncos .
the panthers have reached the playoffs seven times , advancing to four nfc championship games and two super bowls .
they have won six division titles , one in the nfc west and five in the nfc south .
the carolina panthers are legally registered as panther football , llc .
and are controlled by david tepper , whose purchase of the team from founder jerry richardson was unanimously approved by league owners on may *num* , *num* .
the club is worth approximately us$2 .
*num* billion , according to " forbes " .
on december *num* , *num* , entrepreneur jerry richardson announced his bid for an nfl expansion franchise in the carolinas .
a north carolina native , richardson was a former wide receiver on the baltimore colts who had used his *num* league championship bonus to co-found the hardee's restaurant chain , later becoming president and ceo of tw services .
richardson drew his inspiration to pursue an nfl franchise from george shinn , who had made a successful bid for an expansion national basketball association ( nba ) team in charlotte , the charlotte hornets .
richardson founded richardson sports , a partnership consisting of himself , his family , and a number of businessmen from north and south carolina were also recruited to be limited partners .
richardson looked at four potential locations for a stadium , ultimately choosing uptown charlotte .
to highlight the demand for professional football in the carolinas , richardson sports held preseason games around the area from *num* to *num* .
the first two games were held at carter–finley stadium in raleigh , north carolina , and kenan memorial stadium in chapel hill , north carolina , while the third and final game was held at williams-brice stadium in columbia , south carolina .
the matchups were between existing nfl teams .
in *num* , the group formally filed an application for the open expansion spot , and on october *num* , *num* , the *num* nfl owners unanimously named the carolina panthers as the *ord* member of the nfl .
the panthers first competed in the *num* nfl season ; they were one of two expansion teams to begin play that year , the other being the jacksonville jaguars .
the panthers were put in the nfc west to increase the size of that division to five teams ; there were already two other southeastern teams in the division , the atlanta falcons and the new orleans saints .
former pittsburgh steelers defensive coordinator dom capers was named the first head coach .
the team finished its inaugural season , the best performance ever from a first-year expansion team .
they performed even better in their second season , finishing with a record and winning the nfc west division , as well as securing a first-round bye .
the panthers beat the defending super bowl champions dallas cowboys in the divisional round before losing the nfc championship game to the eventual super bowl champions , the green bay packers .
the team managed only a finish in *num* and slipped to in *num* , leading to capers ' dismissal as head coach .
the panthers hired former san francisco 49ers head coach george seifert to replace capers , and he led the team to an record in *num* .

the shape of the panthers logo was designed to mimic the outline of both north carolina and south carolina .
the panthers changed their logo and logotype in *num* , the first such change in team history .
according to the team , the changes were designed to give their logo an " aggressive , contemporary look " as well to give it a more three-dimensional feel .
the primary tweaks were made in the eye and mouth , where the features , particularly the muscular brow and fangs , are more pronounced , creating a more menacing look .
the revised logo has a darker shade of blue over the black logo , compared to the old design , which had teal on top of black .
by the time they had been announced as the *ord* nfl team in october *num* , the panthers ' logo and helmet design had already been finalized , but the uniform design was still under creation .
after discussion , the panthers organization decided on jerseys colored white , black , and blue , and pants colored white and silver .
the exact tone of blue , which they decided would be " process blue " ( a shade lighter than duke's and darker than north carolina's ) , was the most difficult color to choose .
the team's uniform has remained largely the same since its creation , with only minor alterations such as changing the sock color of the team's black uniforms from blue to black and changing the team's shoes from white to black .
richardson , a self-described traditionalist , said that no major uniform changes would be made in his lifetime .
the panthers have three main jersey colors : black , white , and blue .
their blue jerseys , designated their alternate uniforms , are the newest and were introduced in *num* .
nfl regulations allow the team to use the blue jersey up to two times in any given season .
in all other games , the team must wear either their white or black jerseys ; in nfl games , the home team decides whether to wear a dark or white jersey , while the away team wears the opposite .
usually the panthers opt for white or blue when the weather is expected to be hot and for black when the weather is expected to be cold .
the panthers typically pair their white jerseys with white pants , while the black and blue jerseys are paired with silver pants ; there have only been a few exceptions to these combinations .
the first such instance was in *num* , when the team paired their white jerseys with silver pants in a game against the indianapolis colts .
the second instance was in *num* during a game against the denver broncos , when they paired their black jerseys with new black pants ; this created an all-black uniform , with the exception of blue socks and silver helmets .
the decision to wear blue socks was made by team captain steve smith , who felt the blue socks gave the uniforms a more distinct appearance compared with other teams that have all-black uniforms .
the all-black uniforms won the " greatest uniform in nfl history " contest , a fan-voted contest run by nfl .
com in july *num* .
in july *num* , the team's equipment manager , jackie miles , said the panthers intended to use the all-black uniform more in the future .
the panthers wore the all-black uniform three times the following season , once each in the preseason and regular season , and the third time during the home divisional round playoff game vs the 49ers .
during the panthers ' *num* thanksgiving day game against the dallas cowboys , they debuted an all-blue uniform as part of nike's " color rush " series .
in the *num* exhibition season , the panthers wore the black pants with the blue jerseys for a home game vs .
the new england patriots , then paired the black pants with the white jerseys in an away game vs .
the pittsburgh steelers .
during the *num* season , the team did not wear silver pants .
instead they wore all-black uniforms and blue jerseys with white pants .
the team's uniform did not change significantly after nike became the nfl's jersey supplier in *num* , but the collar was altered to honor former panthers player and coach sam mills by featuring the phrase " keep pounding " .
nike had conceived the idea , and the team supported the concept as a way to expose newer fans to the legacy of mills , who died of cancer in *num* .
mills had introduced the phrase , which has since become a team slogan , in a speech that he gave to the players and coaches prior to their *num* playoff game against dallas ; in the speech , mills compared his fight against cancer with the team's on-field battle , saying " when i found out i had cancer , there were two things i could do – quit or keep pounding .
i'm a fighter .
i kept pounding .
you're fighters , too .
keep pounding ! " the panthers played their first season at memorial stadium in clemson , south carolina , as their facility in uptown charlotte was still under construction .
ericsson stadium , called bank of america stadium since *num* , opened in the summer of *num* .
bank of america stadium is owned entirely by the panthers , making them one of the few teams in the nfl to own the facility they play in .
the stadium was specially designed by hok sports facilities group for football and also serves as the headquarters and administrative offices of the panthers .
on some days the stadium offers public tours for a fee .
private tours for groups are offered for a fee seven days a week , though there are some exceptions , and such tours must be arranged in advance .
two bronze panther statues flank each of the stadium's three main entrances ; they are the largest sculptures ever commissioned in the united states .
the names of the team's original psl owners are engraved on the base of each statue .
the two people in the panthers hall of honor , team executive mike mccormack and linebacker sam mills , are honored with life-sized bronze statues outside the stadium .
mills , in addition to being the only player in the hall of honor , is the only player to have had his jersey number ( #51 ) retired by the panthers .
the panthers have three open-air fields next to bank of america stadium where they currently hold their practices ; during the *num* season , when the team played their home games in south carolina , the team held their practices at winthrop university in rock hill , south carolina .
because the practice fields , along with the stadium , are located in uptown charlotte , the fields are directly visible from skyscrapers as well as from a four-story condominium located across the street .
according to mike cranston , a running joke said that the panthers ' division rivals had pooled their resources to purchase a room on the building's top floor , and that a fire at the condominium was caused by the panthers organization .
in order to prevent people from seeing inside the field while the team is practicing , the team has added " strategically planted trees and a tarp over the .
.
.
fence surrounding the fields " .
additionally , they employ a security team to watch for and chase away any people who stop alongside the fence surrounding the field .
in the event of bad weather , the team moves their practices to an indoor sports facility about *num* miles from the stadium .
the team does not own this facility .
the panthers have hosted their annual training camp at wofford college in spartanburg , south carolina , since *num* .
the panthers are supported in both north carolina and south carolina ; south carolina governor nikki haley declared july *num* , *num* , " carolina panthers day " in her state , saying that " when it comes to professional teams , the carolina panthers are the team that south carolina calls their own " .
during the *num* nfc championship and super bowl , the hashtag #onecarolina was used by college and professional sports teams from north carolina and south carolina to show unified support for the panthers .
pat yasinskas of espn .
com observed that while there is " a bit of a wine-and-cheese atmosphere at panthers games .
.
.
there is a strong core of die-hard fans who bring energy to bank of america stadium .
charlotte lives and dies with the panthers because there aren't a lot of other options in the sports world " .
" sports illustrated " graded the panthers as having the *ord* highest " nfl fan value experience " in *num* , attributing much of the fan atmosphere to the team's newness when compared to the established basketball fanbase .
they also observed that the stadium has scattered parking lots , each of which has a different tailgating style .
some have fried chicken , pork , or carolina-style barbecue , while others have live bands and televisions .
pickup football games in the parking lots are common , but fans tend to " behave themselves " , in part due to blue laws that prevent the sale of alcohol before noon on sundays .
the carolina panthers have sold out all home games since december *num* , and their home attendance has ranked in the nfl's top ten since *num* .
sir purr , an anthropomorphic black cat who wears a jersey numbered ' *num* ' , has been the panthers ' mascot since their first season .
during games , sir purr provides sideline entertainment through skits and " silly antics " .
the mascot participates in a number of community events year-round , including a monthly visit to the patients at levine children's hospital .
sir purr also hosts the annual mascot bowl , an event which pits pro and college mascots against each other during halftime at a selected panthers home game .
the team's cheerleaders are the carolina topcats , a group of *num* women who lead cheers and entertain fans at home games .
the topcats participate in both corporate and charity events .
the team's drumline is purrcussion , an ensemble of snare , tenor , and bass drummers as well as cymbal players .
purrcussion performs for fans outside the stadium and introduces players prior to home games ; it consists of drummers from across the carolinas .
starting with the *num* season , the panthers introduced the keep pounding drum , inspired by the aforementioned motivational speech by sam mills before the team's *num* playoff game against the cowboys .
prior to each home game , an honorary drummer hits the six-foot tall drum four times to signify the four quarters of an american football game .
according to the team , the drummers " come from a variety of backgrounds and occupations , but all have overcome a great trial or adversity that has not only made them strong but also pushes them to make others around them stronger " .
drummers have included current and former panthers players , military veterans , make-a-wish children , and athletes from other sports , including nba mvp and charlotte native stephen curry , us women's national soccer team players whitney engen and heather o'reilly , and *num* time nascar cup series champion jimmie johnson .
during the inaugural season of the panthers , the team had an official fight song , which the team played before each home game .
the song , " stand and cheer " , remains the team's official fight song , but the team does not typically play it before home games .
due to negative fan reaction " stand and cheer " was pulled in *num* .
since *num* , the song has returned .
the team plays neil diamond's " sweet caroline " after home victories .
a " keep pounding " chant was introduced during the *num* season which starts before the opening kickoff of each home game .
as prompted by the video boards , one side of the stadium shouts " keep " and the other side replies with " pounding " .
the chant is similar to ones that take place at college football games .

the panthers have developed heated rivalries with the three fellow members of the nfc south ( the atlanta falcons , tampa bay buccaneers , and new orleans saints ) .
the team's fiercest rivals are the falcons and buccaneers .
the falcons are a natural geographic rival for the panthers , as atlanta is only *num* miles ( *num* kilometers ) south on i-85 .
the two teams have played each other twice a year since the panthers ' inception , and games between the two teams feature large contingents of panthers fans at atlanta's mercedes-benz stadium and large contingents of falcons fans at bank of america stadium .
the panthers ' rivalry with tampa bay has been described as the most intense in the nfc south .
the rivalry originated in *num* with the formation of the nfc south , but became particularly heated before the *num* season with verbal bouts between players on the two teams .
it escalated further when the panthers went to tampa bay and beat them in what espn .
com writer pat yasinskas described as " one of the most physical contests in recent memory " .
the rivalry has resulted in a number of severe injuries for players on both teams , some of which were caused by foul play .
one of these plays , an illegal hit on tampa bay punt returner clifton smith , sparked a brief melee between the teams in *num* .
during their time in the nfc west , the panthers began developing a rivalry with the san francisco 49ers .
this rivalry faded after the nfl moved the panthers out of the nfc west .
a relatively new rivalry , this one dates to the *num* nfc championship game , in which the seahawks won the game 31–14 .
the rivalry started up again in *num* , when the panthers lost a close regular season home game to a seattle seahawks team led by rookie quarterback russell wilson , 16–12 .
in the *num* season , the panthers opened the season at home versus seattle .
they again lost a close game , with the final score 12–7 .

the panthers would go on to lose super bowl *num* .
in the *num* season , the teams met in seattle , where the panthers were beaten , 40–7 .

since the *num* season , carolina is overall against seattle and in the playoffs .
the rivalry aspect stems from how close the majority of the matches have been and the fact that they have played each other eight times between *num* and 2018—at least once a year .
the carolina panthers hall of honor was established in *num* to honor individuals for their contributions to the carolina panthers organization .

the stadium also played host to super bowls xlii and xlix , and will host super bowl lvii in *num* .
the franchise's inception dates back to *num* , when a neighborhood group gathered to play in the chicago south side , calling themselves morgan athletic club .
chicago painting and building contractor chris o'brien acquired the team , which he relocated to normal field on racine avenue .
the team was known as racine normals until *num* , when o'brien bought used jerseys from the university of chicago .
he described the faded maroon clothing as " cardinal red " and the team became the racine street cardinals .
the team eventually became in *num* a charter member of the american professional football association ( apfa ) , which two years later was rechristened to national football league ( nfl ) .
the team entered the league as the racine cardinals , however the name was changed in *num* to chicago cardinals to avoid confusion with the horlick-racine legion , who entered the league the same year .
except for *num* , when they were awarded the championship after the pottsville maroons were suspended , the cardinals experienced only minimal success on the playing field during their first *num* seasons in the league .
during the post-world war ii years , the team reached two straight nfl finals against the philadelphia eagles , winning in *num* – eight months after charles bidwill's death – and losing the following year .
after years of bad seasons and losing fans to the cross-town rivals chicago bears , by the late 1950s the cardinals were almost bankrupt , and owner violet bidwill wolfner became interested in a relocation .
due to the formation of the rival american football league , the nfl allowed bidwill to relocate the team to st .
louis , missouri , where they became the st .
louis cardinals ( locally , they were called the " big red " or the " football cardinals " in order to avoid confusion with the baseball team ) .
during the cardinals ' 28-year stay in st .
louis , they advanced to the playoffs just three times ( *num* , *num* & *num* ) , never hosting or winning in any appearance .
the overall mediocrity of the cardinals , combined with a then-21-year-old stadium , caused game attendance to dwindle , and owner bill bidwill decided to move the team to arizona .
not long after the *num* nfl season , bidwill agreed to move to arizona on a handshake deal with state and local officials , and the team became the phoenix cardinals .
the franchise changed its geographic name from phoenix to arizona on march *num* , *num* .
( the franchise has never played in the city of phoenix proper .
) the *num* nfl season saw the cardinals break two long droughts , qualifying for the playoffs for the first time in *num* years .
the team got their first postseason win since *num* by winning the wild card playoffs .
in *num* , the cardinals won the nfc championship game to advance to the super bowl for the first time in franchise history .
they lost super bowl xliii 27–23 to the pittsburgh steelers in the final seconds .
after their historic *num* season , the cardinals posted a 10–6 record in *num* , their first season with *num* wins in arizona .
the cardinals clinched their second consecutive nfc west title , and were defeated by eventual super bowl champion new orleans saints 45–14 in the divisional playoffs .
the next time they would make the playoffs would be in *num* , when they ended up as a wild card .
they set the best regular-season record in the team's history in arizona at 11–5 , but were defeated by the 7–8–1 nfc south champions carolina panthers .
the next year , the cardinals set a franchise-best 13–3 record , and clinched their first-ever first-round playoff bye as the nfc's second seed .
they defeated the green bay packers 26–20 in overtime , giving quarterback carson palmer his first playoff victory .
the cardinals then advanced to their second nfc championship game in their history , but were blown out by the top-seeded 15–1 panthers 49–15 , committing seven turnovers .
starting in , the team had a logo of a cardinal bird perched on the stitches of a football .
the cardinals moved to arizona in , and the flag of arizona was added to the sleeves the following year .
in , the team began wearing red pants with their white jerseys , as new coach joe bugel wanted to emulate his former employer , the washington redskins , who at the time wore burgundy pants with their white jerseys ( the redskins later returned to their 1970s gold pants with all their jerseys ) .
in , the cardinals participated in the nfl's *ord* anniversary throwback uniform program .
the jerseys were similar to those of the 1920s chicago cardinals , with an interlocking " cc " logo and three stripes on each sleeve .
the uniform numbers were relocated to the right chest .
the pants were khaki to simulate the color and material used in that era .
the cardinals also stripped the logos from their helmets for two games : at cleveland and home vs .
pittsburgh .
the cardinal head on the helmet was repeated on the white jersey from *num* to *num* .
in *num* , the state flag of arizona was moved higher on the sleeve after the cardinal head was eliminated , and black was removed as an accent color , instead replaced with a blue to match the predominant color of the state flag .
in *num* , the cardinals began to wear all-red and all-white combinations , and continued to do so through *num* , prior to the team's makeover .
in , the team unveiled its first major changes in a century .
the cardinal-head logo was updated to look sleeker and meaner than its predecessor .
numerous fans had derisively called the previous version a " parakeet " .
black again became an accent color after an eight-year absence , while trim lines were added to the outside shoulders , sleeves , and sides of the jerseys and pants .
both the red and white jerseys have the option of red or white pants .
hoping to break a six-game losing streak , the cardinals wore the red pants for the first time on october *num* , *num* , in a game at lambeau field against the green bay packers .
the packers won 31–14 , and the cards headed into their bye week with a 1–7 mark .
following the bye week , the cardinals came out in an all-red combination at home against the dallas cowboys and lost , 27–10 .
arizona did not wear the red pants for the remainder of the season and won four of their last seven games .
however , the following season , in , the cardinals again wore their red pants for their final *num* home games .
they wore red pants with white jerseys in games on the road at the cincinnati bengals and seattle seahawks .
they paired red pants with red jerseys , the all-red combination , for home games against the detroit lions , san francisco 49ers , cleveland browns , and st .
louis rams .
the red pants were not worn at all in , but they were used in home games vs .
seattle , minnesota , and st .
louis in .
the red pants were paired with the white road jersey for the first time in three years during a *num* game at carolina , but the white jersey / red pants combination has not been used since .
the cardinals ' first home game in arizona , in *num* , saw them play in red jerseys .
thereafter , for the next *num* years in arizona , the cardinals , like a few other nfl teams in warm climates , wore their white jerseys at home during the first half of the season—forcing opponents to suffer in their darker jerseys during arizona autumns that frequently see temperatures over *num* °f ( *num* °c ) .
however , this tradition did not continue when the cardinals moved from sun devil stadium to state farm stadium in *num* , as early-season games ( and some home games late in the season ) were played with the roof closed .
with the temperature inside at a comfortable *num* °f ( *num* °c ) , the team opted to wear red jerseys at home full-time .
the cardinals wore white jerseys at home for the first time at state farm stadium on august *num* , *num* , in a preseason game against the denver broncos .
the cardinals wore white at home for the first time in a regular season game at state farm stadium against the houston texans on october *num* , .
in october *num* , the nfl recognized breast cancer awareness month , and players wore pink-accented items , including gloves , wristbands , and shoes .
the team thought the pink accents looked better with white uniforms than with red .
from *num* through *num* , and again in many seasons between *num* and *num* , the cardinals would wear white when hosting the dallas cowboys in order to force the cowboys to don their " jinxed " blue jerseys .
they have not done this since moving into state farm stadium , however .
the season saw the cardinals debut a new , alternate black jersey .
prior to its introduction , the cardinals were the only nfl team without an alternate jersey or throwback kit , save for the nfl's *ord* anniversary program in *num* .

the cardinals ' ring of honor was started in to mark the opening of state farm stadium .
it honors former cardinal greats from all eras of the franchise's history .
following is a list of inductees and the dates that they were inducted .
the cardinals ' flagship radio station is kmvp-fm ; dave pasch , ron wolfley , and paul calvisi handle the radio broadcast .
spanish-language radio broadcasts are heard on the combo of kqmr / khov-fm " latino mix " under a contract with univisión , signed in *num* .
prior to *num* , they were heard on kdva / kvva-fm " josé fm " , as well as co-owned kbmb am *num* .
the cardinals were the first nfl team to offer all *num* preseason and regular season games on spanish-language radio , doing so in *num* .
gabriel trujillo and rolando cantú are the spanish broadcast team .
the cardinals have the most extensive mexican affiliate network in the nfl , with contracts with grupo larsa ( in the state of sonora ) and grupo radiorama ( outside sonora ) and stations in *num* cities , including hermosillo , guadalajara and mexico city .
as of the *num* season , nbc affiliate kpnx broadcasts the team's preseason games on television ( which , that year , included the hall of fame game broadcast by nbc ) , called by pasch and wolfley , with station anchor paul gerke as sideline reporter .
the broadcasts are syndicated regionally to kttu and kmsb-tv in tucson , and kvvu-tv in las vegas .
common desktop environment the common desktop environment ( cde ) is a desktop environment for unix and openvms , based on the motif widget toolkit .
it was part of the unix *num* workstation product standard , and was long time the " classic " unix desktop associated with commercial unix workstations .
after a long history as proprietary software , cde was released as free software on august *num* , *num* , under the gnu lesser general public license , version *num* or later .
since its release as free software , cde has been ported to linux and bsd derivatives .
hewlett-packard , ibm , sunsoft , and usl announced cde in june *num* as a joint development within the common open software environment ( cose ) initiative .
each development group contributed its own technology to cde : after its release , hp endorsed cde as the new standard desktop for unix , and provided documentation and software for migrating hp vue customizations to cde .
in march *num* cde became the responsibility of the " new osf " , a merger of the open software foundation and unix international ; in september *num* , the merger of motif and cde into a single project , cde / motif , was announced .
osf became part of the newly formed open group in *num* .
in february *num* , the open group released their last major version of cde , version *num* .
*num* .
red hat linux was the only linux distribution that proprietary cde was ported to .
in *num* , red hat began offering a version of cde licensed from triteal corporation .
in *num* , xi graphics , a company specializing in the x windowing system , offered a version of cde bundled with red hat linux , called " xi graphics maximum cde / os " .
these were phased out , and red hat moved to the gnome desktop .
until about *num* , users of unix desktops regarded cde as the " de facto " standard , but at that time , other desktop environments such as gnome and k desktop environment *num* were quickly becoming mature , and became widespread on linux systems .
in *num* , sun microsystems announced that they would phase out cde as the standard desktop environment in solaris in favor of gnome .
solaris *num* , released in early *num* , includes both cde and the gnome-based java desktop system .
the opensolaris project , begun around the same time , did not include cde , and had no intent to make solaris cde available as open-source .
the original release of solaris *num* in november *num* only contained gnome as standard desktop , though some cde libraries , such as motif and tooltalk , remained for binary compatibility but oracle solaris *num* .
*num* , released in august *num* , removed support for the cde runtime environment and background services .
from its launch until *num* , cde was proprietary software .
motif , the toolkit on which cde is built , was released by the open group in *num* as " open motif , " under a " revenue sharing " license .
that license did not meet either the open source or free software definitions .
the open group had wished to make motif open source , but did not succeed doing so at that time .
in *num* , a petition was created asking the open group to release the source code for cde and motif under a free license .
on august *num* , *num* , cde was open-sourced under the lgpl free software license .
the cde source code was then released to sourceforge .
the free software project opencde had been started in *num* to reproduce the look and feel , organization , and feature set of cde .
in august *num* , when cde was released as free software , opencde was officially deprecated in favor of cde .
on october *num* , *num* , the motif widget toolkit was also released under the lgpl v2 .
*num* .
this allowed cde to become a completely free and open source desktop environment .
shortly after cde was released as free software , a linux live cd was created based on debian *num* with cde *num* .
*num* .
0c pre-installed , called cdebian .
the live cd has since been discontinued .
the debian based linux distribution sparkylinux offers binary packages of cde that can be installed with apt .
in march *num* , the first stable release of cde , version *num* .
*num* .
*num* , was made since its release as free software .
beginning with version *num* .
*num* .
*num* , released in july *num* , cde is able to compile under freebsd *num* with the default clang compiler .
since version *num* .
*num* .
*num* , released in july *num* , cde uses tirpc on linux , so that the portmapper rpcbind does not need to be run in insecure mode .
it does not use xprint anymore , and can be compiled on the bsds without installing first a custom version of motif .
multihead display support with xinerama has been improved .
consciousness consciousness is the state or quality of awareness or of being aware of an external object or something within oneself .
it has been defined variously in terms of sentience , awareness , qualia , subjectivity , the ability to experience or to feel , wakefulness , having a sense of selfhood or soul , the fact that there is something " that it is like " to " have " or " be " it , and the executive control system of the mind .
despite the difficulty in definition , many philosophers believe that there is a broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is .
as max velmans and susan schneider wrote in " the blackwell companion to consciousness " : " anything that we are aware of at a given moment forms part of our consciousness , making conscious experience at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives .
" western philosophers , since the time of descartes and locke , have struggled to comprehend the nature of consciousness and identify its essential properties .
issues of concern in the philosophy of consciousness include whether the concept is fundamentally coherent ; whether consciousness can ever be explained mechanistically ; whether non-human consciousness exists and if so how it can be recognized ; how consciousness relates to language ; whether consciousness can be understood in a way that does not require a dualistic distinction between mental and physical states or properties ; and whether it may ever be possible for computing machines like computers or robots to be conscious , a topic studied in the field of artificial intelligence .
thanks to developments in technology over the past few decades , consciousness has become a significant topic of interdisciplinary research in cognitive science , with significant contributions from fields such as psychology , anthropology , neuropsychology and neuroscience .
the primary focus is on understanding what it means biologically and psychologically for information to be present in consciousness—that is , on determining the neural and psychological correlates of consciousness .
the majority of experimental studies assess consciousness in humans by asking subjects for a verbal report of their experiences ( e .
g .
, " tell me if you notice anything when i do this " ) .
issues of interest include phenomena such as subliminal perception , blindsight , denial of impairment , and altered states of consciousness produced by alcohol and other drugs , or spiritual or meditative techniques .
in medicine , consciousness is assessed by observing a patient's arousal and responsiveness , and can be seen as a continuum of states ranging from full alertness and comprehension , through disorientation , delirium , loss of meaningful communication , and finally loss of movement in response to painful stimuli .
issues of practical concern include how the presence of consciousness can be assessed in severely ill , comatose , or anesthetized people , and how to treat conditions in which consciousness is impaired or disrupted .
the degree of consciousness is measured by standardized behavior observation scales such as the glasgow coma scale .
the origin of the modern concept of consciousness is often attributed to john locke's " essay concerning human understanding " , published in *num* .
locke defined consciousness as " the perception of what passes in a man's own mind " .
his essay influenced the 18th-century view of consciousness , and his definition appeared in samuel johnson's celebrated " dictionary " ( *num* ) .
"consciousness " ( french : " conscience " ) is also defined in the *num* volume of diderot and d'alembert's encyclopédie , as " the opinion or internal feeling that we ourselves have from what we do .
" the earliest english language uses of " conscious " and " consciousness " date back , however , to the 1500s .
the english word " conscious " originally derived from the latin " conscius " ( " con- " " together " and " scio " " to know " ) , but the latin word did not have the same meaning as our word—it meant " knowing with " , in other words " having joint or common knowledge with another " .
there were , however , many occurrences in latin writings of the phrase " conscius sibi " , which translates literally as " knowing with oneself " , or in other words " sharing knowledge with oneself about something " .
this phrase had the figurative meaning of " knowing that one knows " , as the modern english word " conscious " does .
in its earliest uses in the 1500s , the english word " conscious " retained the meaning of the latin " conscius " .
for example , thomas hobbes in " leviathan " wrote : " where two , or more men , know of one and the same fact , they are said to be conscious of it one to another .
" the latin phrase " conscius sibi " , whose meaning was more closely related to the current concept of consciousness , was rendered in english as " conscious to oneself " or " conscious unto oneself " .
for example , archbishop ussher wrote in *num* of " being so conscious unto myself of my great weakness " .
locke's definition from *num* illustrates that a gradual shift in meaning had taken place .
a related word was " " , which primarily means moral conscience .
in the literal sense , " conscientia " means knowledge-with , that is , shared knowledge .
the word first appears in latin juridical texts by writers such as cicero .
here , " conscientia " is the knowledge that a witness has of the deed of someone else .
rené descartes ( 1596–1650 ) is generally taken to be the first philosopher to use " conscientia " in a way that does not fit this traditional meaning .
descartes used " conscientia " the way modern speakers would use " conscience " .
in " search after truth " ( " " , amsterdam *num* ) he says " conscience or internal testimony " ( " conscientiâ , vel interno testimonio " ) .
the dictionary meanings of the word " consciousness " extend through several centuries and several associated related meanings .
these have ranged from formal definitions to definitions attempting to capture the less easily captured and more debated meanings and usage of the word .
one formal definition indicating the range of these related meanings is given in " webster's third new international dictionary " stating that " consciousness " is : the cambridge dictionary defines consciousness as " "the state of understanding and realizing something .
" " the oxford living dictionary defines consciousness as " "the state of being aware of and responsive to one's surroundings .
" " , " "a person's awareness or perception of something .
" " and " "the fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world .
" " most definitions include awareness , but some include a more general state of being .
the philosophy of mind has given rise to many stances regarding consciousness .
the " routledge encyclopedia of philosophy " in *num* defines consciousness as follows : in a more skeptical definition of " consciousness " , stuart sutherland has exemplified some of the difficulties in fully ascertaining all of its cognate meanings in his entry for the *num* version of the " macmillan dictionary of psychology " : most writers on the philosophy of consciousness have been concerned with defending a particular point of view , and have organized their material accordingly .
for surveys , the most common approach is to follow a historical path by associating stances with the philosophers who are most strongly associated with them , for example descartes , locke , kant , etc .
an alternative is to organize philosophical stances according to basic issues .
philosophers and non-philosophers differ in their intuitions about what consciousness is .
while most people have a strong intuition for the existence of what they refer to as consciousness , skeptics argue that this intuition is false , either because the concept of consciousness is intrinsically incoherent , or because our intuitions about it are based in illusions .
gilbert ryle , for example , argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a cartesian dualist outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body , or between mind and world .
he proposed that we speak not of minds , bodies , and the world , but of individuals , or persons , acting in the world .
thus , by speaking of " consciousness " we end up misleading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings .
more generally , many philosophers and scientists have been unhappy about the difficulty of producing a definition that does not involve circularity or fuzziness .
many philosophers have argued that consciousness is a unitary concept that is understood intuitively by the majority of people in spite of the difficulty in defining it .
others , though , have argued that the level of disagreement about the meaning of the word indicates that it either means different things to different people ( for instance , the objective versus subjective aspects of consciousness ) , or else is an umbrella term encompassing a variety of distinct meanings with no simple element in common .
ned block proposed a distinction between two types of consciousness that he called " phenomenal " ( p-consciousness ) and " access " ( a-consciousness ) .
p-consciousness , according to block , is simply raw experience : it is moving , colored forms , sounds , sensations , emotions and feelings with our bodies ' and responses at the center .
these experiences , considered independently of any impact on behavior , are called qualia .
a-consciousness , on the other hand , is the phenomenon whereby information in our minds is accessible for verbal report , reasoning , and the control of behavior .
so , when we perceive , information about what we perceive is access conscious ; when we introspect , information about our thoughts is access conscious ; when we remember , information about the past is access conscious , and so on .
although some philosophers , such as daniel dennett , have disputed the validity of this distinction , others have broadly accepted it .
david chalmers has argued that a-consciousness can in principle be understood in mechanistic terms , but that understanding p-consciousness is much more challenging : he calls this the hard problem of consciousness .
some philosophers believe that block's two types of consciousness are not the end of the story .
william lycan , for example , argued in his book " consciousness and experience " that at least eight clearly distinct types of consciousness can be identified ( organism consciousness ; control consciousness ; consciousness " of " ; state / event consciousness ; reportability ; introspective consciousness ; subjective consciousness ; self-consciousness ) —and that even this list omits several more obscure forms .
there is also debate over whether or not a-consciousness and p-consciousness always co-exist or if they can exist separately .
although p-consciousness without a-consciousness is more widely accepted , there have been some hypothetical examples of a without p .
block for instance suggests the case of a “zombie” that is computationally identical to a person but without any subjectivity .
however , he remains somewhat skeptical concluding " i don’t know whether there are any actual cases of a-consciousness without p-consciousness , but i hope i have illustrated their conceptual possibility .
" mental processes ( such as consciousness ) and physical processes ( such as brain events ) seem to be correlated , however the specific nature of the connection is unknown .
the first influential philosopher to discuss this question specifically was descartes , and the answer he gave is known as cartesian dualism .
descartes proposed that consciousness resides within an immaterial domain he called res cogitans ( the realm of thought ) , in contrast to the domain of material things , which he called res extensa ( the realm of extension ) .
he suggested that the interaction between these two domains occurs inside the brain , perhaps in a small midline structure called the pineal gland .
although it is widely accepted that descartes explained the problem cogently , few later philosophers have been happy with his solution , and his ideas about the pineal gland have especially been ridiculed .
however , no alternative solution has gained general acceptance .
proposed solutions can be divided broadly into two categories : dualist solutions that maintain descartes ' rigid distinction between the realm of consciousness and the realm of matter but give different answers for how the two realms relate to each other ; and monist solutions that maintain that there is really only one realm of being , of which consciousness and matter are both aspects .
each of these categories itself contains numerous variants .
the two main types of dualism are substance dualism ( which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics ) and property dualism ( which holds that the laws of physics are universally valid but cannot be used to explain the mind ) .
the three main types of monism are physicalism ( which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way ) , idealism ( which holds that only thought or experience truly exists , and matter is merely an illusion ) , and neutral monism ( which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them ) .
there are also , however , a large number of idiosyncratic theories that cannot cleanly be assigned to any of these schools of thought .
since the dawn of newtonian science with its vision of simple mechanical principles governing the entire universe , some philosophers have been tempted by the idea that consciousness could be explained in purely physical terms .
the first influential writer to propose such an idea explicitly was julien offray de la mettrie , in his book " man a machine " ( " l'homme machine " ) .
his arguments , however , were very abstract .
the most influential modern physical theories of consciousness are based on psychology and neuroscience .
theories proposed by neuroscientists such as gerald edelman and antonio damasio , and by philosophers such as daniel dennett , seek to explain consciousness in terms of neural events occurring within the brain .
many other neuroscientists , such as christof koch , have explored the neural basis of consciousness without attempting to frame all-encompassing global theories .
at the same time , computer scientists working in the field of artificial intelligence have pursued the goal of creating digital computer programs that can simulate or embody consciousness .
a few theoretical physicists have argued that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness , but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients .
several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind ( qm ) theories of consciousness .
notable theories falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of karl pribram and david bohm , and the orch-or theory formulated by stuart hameroff and roger penrose .
some of these qm theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness , as well as qm interpretations of access consciousness .
none of the quantum mechanical theories have been confirmed by experiment .
recent publications by g .
guerreshi , j .
cia , s .
popescu , and h .
briegel could falsify proposals such as those of hameroff , which rely on quantum entanglement in protein .
at the present time many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing .
apart from the general question of the " hard problem " of consciousness , roughly speaking , the question of how mental experience arises from a physical basis , a more specialized question is how to square the subjective notion that we are in control of our decisions ( at least in some small measure ) with the customary view of causality that subsequent events are caused by prior events .
the topic of free will is the philosophical and scientific examination of this conundrum .
many philosophers consider experience to be the essence of consciousness , and believe that experience can only fully be known from the inside , subjectively .
but if consciousness is subjective and not visible from the outside , why do the vast majority of people believe that other people are conscious , but rocks and trees are not ? this is called the problem of other minds .
it is particularly acute for people who believe in the possibility of philosophical zombies , that is , people who think it is possible in principle to have an entity that is physically indistinguishable from a human being and behaves like a human being in every way but nevertheless lacks consciousness .
related issues have also been studied extensively by greg littmann of the university of illinois .
and colin allen a professor at indiana university regarding the literature and research studying artificial intelligence in androids .
the most commonly given answer is that we attribute consciousness to other people because we see that they resemble us in appearance and behavior ; we reason that if they look like us and act like us , they must be like us in other ways , including having experiences of the sort that we do .
there are , however , a variety of problems with that explanation .
for one thing , it seems to violate the principle of parsimony , by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe .
some philosophers , such as daniel dennett in an essay titled " the unimagined preposterousness of zombies " , argue that people who give this explanation do not really understand what they are saying .
more broadly , philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior ( including verbal behavior ) , and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior .
a more straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because of what they can " do " , including the fact that they can tell us about their experiences .
the topic of animal consciousness is beset by a number of difficulties .
it poses the problem of other minds in an especially severe form , because non-human animals , lacking the ability to express human language , cannot tell us about their experiences .
also , it is difficult to reason objectively about the question , because a denial that an animal is conscious is often taken to imply that it does not feel , its life has no value , and that harming it is not morally wrong .
descartes , for example , has sometimes been blamed for mistreatment of animals due to the fact that he believed only humans have a non-physical mind .
most people have a strong intuition that some animals , such as cats and dogs , are conscious , while others , such as insects , are not ; but the sources of this intuition are not obvious , and are often based on personal interactions with pets and other animals they have observed .
philosophers who consider subjective experience the essence of consciousness also generally believe , as a correlate , that the existence and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known .
thomas nagel spelled out this point of view in an influential essay titled " what is it like to be a bat ? " .
he said that an organism is conscious " if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism—something it is like " for " the organism " ; and he argued that no matter how much we know about an animal's brain and behavior , we can never really put ourselves into the mind of the animal and experience its world in the way it does itself .
other thinkers , such as douglas hofstadter , dismiss this argument as incoherent .
several psychologists and ethologists have argued for the existence of animal consciousness by describing a range of behaviors that appear to show animals holding beliefs about things they cannot directly perceive—donald griffin's *num* book " animal minds " reviews a substantial portion of the evidence .
on july *num* , *num* , eminent scientists from different branches of neuroscience gathered at the university of cambridge to celebrate the francis crick memorial conference , which deals with consciousness in humans and pre-linguistic consciousness in nonhuman animals .
after the conference , they signed in the presence of stephen hawking , the ' cambridge declaration on consciousness ' , which summarizes the most important findings of the survey : "we decided to reach a consensus and make a statement directed to the public that is not scientific .
it's obvious to everyone in this room that animals have consciousness , but it is not obvious to the rest of the world .
it is not obvious to the rest of the western world or the far east .
it is not obvious to the society .
" "convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals [ .
.
.
] , including all mammals and birds , and other creatures , [ .
.
.
] have the necessary neural substrates of consciousness and the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors .
" the idea of an artifact made conscious is an ancient theme of mythology , appearing for example in the greek myth of pygmalion , who carved a statue that was magically brought to life , and in medieval jewish stories of the golem , a magically animated homunculus built of clay .
however , the possibility of actually constructing a conscious machine was probably first discussed by ada lovelace , in a set of notes written in *num* about the analytical engine invented by charles babbage , a precursor ( never built ) to modern electronic computers .
lovelace was essentially dismissive of the idea that a machine such as the analytical engine could think in a humanlike way .
she wrote : one of the most influential contributions to this question was an essay written in *num* by pioneering computer scientist alan turing , titled " computing machinery and intelligence " .
turing disavowed any interest in terminology , saying that even " can machines think ? " is too loaded with spurious connotations to be meaningful ; but he proposed to replace all such questions with a specific operational test , which has become known as the turing test .
to pass the test , a computer must be able to imitate a human well enough to fool interrogators .
in his essay turing discussed a variety of possible objections , and presented a counterargument to each of them .
the turing test is commonly cited in discussions of artificial intelligence as a proposed criterion for machine consciousness ; it has provoked a great deal of philosophical debate .
for example , daniel dennett and douglas hofstadter argue that anything capable of passing the turing test is necessarily conscious , while david chalmers argues that a philosophical zombie could pass the test , yet fail to be conscious .
a third group of scholars have argued that with technological growth once machines begin to display any substantial signs of human-like behavior then the dichotomy ( of human consciousness compared to human-like consciousness ) becomes passé and issues of machine autonomy begin to prevail even as observed in its nascent form within contemporary industry and technology .
jürgen schmidhuber argues that consciousness is simply the result of compression .
as an agent sees representation of itself recurring in the environment , the compression of this representation can be called consciousness .
in a lively exchange over what has come to be referred to as " the chinese room argument " , john searle sought to refute the claim of proponents of what he calls " strong artificial intelligence ( ai ) " that a computer program can be conscious , though he does agree with advocates of " weak ai " that computer programs can be formatted to " simulate " conscious states .
his own view is that consciousness has subjective , first-person causal powers by being essentially intentional due simply to the way human brains function biologically ; conscious persons can perform computations , but consciousness is not inherently computational the way computer programs are .
to make a turing machine that speaks chinese , searle imagines a room with one monolingual english speaker ( searle himself , in fact ) , a book that designates a combination of chinese symbols to be output paired with chinese symbol input , and boxes filled with chinese symbols .
in this case , the english speaker is acting as a computer and the rulebook as a program .
searle argues that with such a machine , he would be able to process the inputs to outputs perfectly without having any understanding of chinese , nor having any idea what the questions and answers could possibly mean .
if the experiment were done in english , since searle knows english , he would be able to take questions and give answers without any algorithms for english questions , and he would be effectively aware of what was being said and the purposes it might serve .
searle would pass the turing test of answering the questions in both languages , but he is only conscious of what he is doing when he speaks english .
another way of putting the argument is to say that computer programs can pass the turing test for processing the syntax of a language , but that the syntax cannot lead to semantic meaning in the way strong ai advocates hoped .
in the literature concerning artificial intelligence , searle's essay has been second only to turing's in the volume of debate it has generated .
searle himself was vague about what extra ingredients it would take to make a machine conscious : all he proposed was that what was needed was " causal powers " of the sort that the brain has and that computers lack .
but other thinkers sympathetic to his basic argument have suggested that the necessary ( though perhaps still not sufficient ) extra conditions may include the ability to pass not just the verbal version of the turing test , but the robotic version , which requires grounding the robot's words in the robot's sensorimotor capacity to categorize and interact with the things in the world that its words are about , turing-indistinguishably from a real person .
turing-scale robotics is an empirical branch of research on embodied cognition and situated cognition .
in *num* , victor argonov has suggested a non-turing test for machine consciousness based on machine's ability to produce philosophical judgments .
he argues that a deterministic machine must be regarded as conscious if it is able to produce judgments on all problematic properties of consciousness ( such as qualia or binding ) having no innate ( preloaded ) philosophical knowledge on these issues , no philosophical discussions while learning , and no informational models of other creatures in its memory ( such models may implicitly or explicitly contain knowledge about these creatures’ consciousness ) .
however , this test can be used only to detect , but not refute the existence of consciousness .
a positive result proves that machine is conscious but a negative result proves nothing .
for example , absence of philosophical judgments may be caused by lack of the machine’s intellect , not by absence of consciousness .
for many decades , consciousness as a research topic was avoided by the majority of mainstream scientists , because of a general feeling that a phenomenon defined in subjective terms could not properly be studied using objective experimental methods .
in *num* george mandler published an influential psychological study which distinguished between slow , serial , and limited conscious processes and fast , parallel and extensive unconscious ones .
starting in the 1980s , an expanding community of neuroscientists and psychologists have associated themselves with a field called " consciousness studies " , giving rise to a stream of experimental work published in books , journals such as " consciousness and cognition " , " frontiers in consciousness research " , " psyche " , and the " journal of consciousness studies " , along with regular conferences organized by groups such as the association for the scientific study of consciousness .
modern medical and psychological investigations into consciousness are based on psychological experiments ( including , for example , the investigation of priming effects using subliminal stimuli ) , and on case studies of alterations in consciousness produced by trauma , illness , or drugs .
broadly viewed , scientific approaches are based on two core concepts .
the first identifies the content of consciousness with the experiences that are reported by human subjects ; the second makes use of the concept of consciousness that has been developed by neurologists and other medical professionals who deal with patients whose behavior is impaired .
in either case , the ultimate goals are to develop techniques for assessing consciousness objectively in humans as well as other animals , and to understand the neural and psychological mechanisms that underlie it .
experimental research on consciousness presents special difficulties , due to the lack of a universally accepted operational definition .
in the majority of experiments that are specifically about consciousness , the subjects are human , and the criterion used is verbal report : in other words , subjects are asked to describe their experiences , and their descriptions are treated as observations of the contents of consciousness .
for example , subjects who stare continuously at a necker cube usually report that they experience it " flipping " between two 3d configurations , even though the stimulus itself remains the same .
the objective is to understand the relationship between the conscious awareness of stimuli ( as indicated by verbal report ) and the effects the stimuli have on brain activity and behavior .
in several paradigms , such as the technique of response priming , the behavior of subjects is clearly influenced by stimuli for which they report no awareness , and suitable experimental manipulations can lead to increasing priming effects despite decreasing prime identification ( double dissociation ) .
verbal report is widely considered to be the most reliable indicator of consciousness , but it raises a number of issues .
for one thing , if verbal reports are treated as observations , akin to observations in other branches of science , then the possibility arises that they may contain errors—but it is difficult to make sense of the idea that subjects could be wrong about their own experiences , and even more difficult to see how such an error could be detected .
daniel dennett has argued for an approach he calls heterophenomenology , which means treating verbal reports as stories that may or may not be true , but his ideas about how to do this have not been widely adopted .
another issue with verbal report as a criterion is that it restricts the field of study to humans who have language : this approach cannot be used to study consciousness in other species , pre-linguistic children , or people with types of brain damage that impair language .
as a third issue , philosophers who dispute the validity of the turing test may feel that it is possible , at least in principle , for verbal report to be dissociated from consciousness entirely : a philosophical zombie may give detailed verbal reports of awareness in the absence of any genuine awareness .
although verbal report is in practice the " gold standard " for ascribing consciousness , it is not the only possible criterion .
in medicine , consciousness is assessed as a combination of verbal behavior , arousal , brain activity and purposeful movement .
the last three of these can be used as indicators of consciousness when verbal behavior is absent .
the scientific literature regarding the neural bases of arousal and purposeful movement is very extensive .
their reliability as indicators of consciousness is disputed , however , due to numerous studies showing that alert human subjects can be induced to behave purposefully in a variety of ways in spite of reporting a complete lack of awareness .
studies of the neuroscience of free will have also shown that the experiences that people report when they behave purposefully sometimes do not correspond to their actual behaviors or to the patterns of electrical activity recorded from their brains .
another approach applies specifically to the study of self-awareness , that is , the ability to distinguish oneself from others .
in the 1970s gordon gallup developed an operational test for self-awareness , known as the mirror test .
the test examines whether animals are able to differentiate between seeing themselves in a mirror versus seeing other animals .
the classic example involves placing a spot of coloring on the skin or fur near the individual's forehead and seeing if they attempt to remove it or at least touch the spot , thus indicating that they recognize that the individual they are seeing in the mirror is themselves .
humans ( older than *num* months ) and other great apes , bottlenose dolphins , killer whales , pigeons , european magpies and elephants have all been observed to pass this test .
a major part of the scientific literature on consciousness consists of studies that examine the relationship between the experiences reported by subjects and the activity that simultaneously takes place in their brains—that is , studies of the neural correlates of consciousness .
the hope is to find that activity in a particular part of the brain , or a particular pattern of global brain activity , which will be strongly predictive of conscious awareness .
several brain imaging techniques , such as eeg and fmri , have been used for physical measures of brain activity in these studies .
another idea that has drawn attention for several decades is that consciousness is associated with high-frequency ( gamma band ) oscillations in brain activity .
this idea arose from proposals in the 1980s , by christof von der malsburg and wolf singer , that gamma oscillations could solve the so-called binding problem , by linking information represented in different parts of the brain into a unified experience .
rodolfo llinás , for example , proposed that consciousness results from recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance where the specific thalamocortical systems ( content ) and the non-specific ( centromedial thalamus ) thalamocortical systems ( context ) interact in the gamma band frequency via synchronous oscillations .
a number of studies have shown that activity in primary sensory areas of the brain is not sufficient to produce consciousness : it is possible for subjects to report a lack of awareness even when areas such as the primary visual cortex show clear electrical responses to a stimulus .
higher brain areas are seen as more promising , especially the prefrontal cortex , which is involved in a range of higher cognitive functions collectively known as executive functions .
there is substantial evidence that a " top-down " flow of neural activity ( i .
e .
, activity propagating from the frontal cortex to sensory areas ) is more predictive of conscious awareness than a " bottom-up " flow of activity .
the prefrontal cortex is not the only candidate area , however : studies by nikos logothetis and his colleagues have shown , for example , that visually responsive neurons in parts of the temporal lobe reflect the visual perception in the situation when conflicting visual images are presented to different eyes ( i .
e .
, bistable percepts during binocular rivalry ) .
modulation of neural responses may correlate with phenomenal experiences .
in contrast to the raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness , the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with an important aspect of consciousness : namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity ( brightness , contrast ) .
in the research group of danko nikolić it has been shown that some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony .
an fmri investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas .
this indicates that , in the primary visual areas , changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualia—at least for some type of qualia .
in *num* , graziano and kastner proposed the " attention schema " theory of awareness .
in that theory , specific cortical areas , notably in the superior temporal sulcus and the temporo-parietal junction , are used to build the construct of awareness and attribute it to other people .
the same cortical machinery is also used to attribute awareness to oneself .
damage to these cortical regions can lead to deficits in consciousness such as hemispatial neglect .
in the attention schema theory , the value of explaining the feature of awareness and attributing it to a person is to gain a useful predictive model of that person's attentional processing .
attention is a style of information processing in which a brain focuses its resources on a limited set of interrelated signals .
awareness , in this theory , is a useful , simplified schema that represents attentional states .
to be aware of x is explained by constructing a model of one's attentional focus on x .
in *num* , the perturbational complexity index ( pci ) was proposed , a measure of the algorithmic complexity of the electrophysiological response of the cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation .
this measure was shown to be higher in individuals that are awake , in rem sleep or in a locked-in state than in those who are in deep sleep or in a vegetative state , making it potentially useful as a quantitative assessment of consciousness states .
assuming that not only humans but even some non-mammalian species are conscious , a number of evolutionary approaches to the problem of neural correlates of consciousness open up .
for example , assuming that birds are conscious—a common assumption among neuroscientists and ethologists due to the extensive cognitive repertoire of birds—there are comparative neuroanatomical ways to validate some of the principal , currently competing , mammalian consciousness–brain theories .
the rationale for such a comparative study is that the avian brain deviates structurally from the mammalian brain .
so how similar are they ? what homologues can be identified ? the general conclusion from the study by butler , et al .
, is that some of the major theories for the mammalian brain also appear to be valid for the avian brain .
the structures assumed to be critical for consciousness in mammalian brains have homologous counterparts in avian brains .
thus the main portions of the theories of crick and koch , edelman and tononi , and cotterill seem to be compatible with the assumption that birds are conscious .
edelman also differentiates between what he calls primary consciousness ( which is a trait shared by humans and non-human animals ) and higher-order consciousness as it appears in humans alone along with human language capacity .
certain aspects of the three theories , however , seem less easy to apply to the hypothesis of avian consciousness .
for instance , the suggestion by crick and koch that layer *num* neurons of the mammalian brain have a special role , seems difficult to apply to the avian brain , since the avian homologues have a different morphology .
likewise , the theory of eccles seems incompatible , since a structural homologue / analogue to the dendron has not been found in avian brains .
the assumption of an avian consciousness also brings the reptilian brain into focus .
the reason is the structural continuity between avian and reptilian brains , meaning that the phylogenetic origin of consciousness may be earlier than suggested by many leading neuroscientists .
joaquin fuster of ucla has advocated the position of the importance of the prefrontal cortex in humans , along with the areas of wernicke and broca , as being of particular importance to the development of human language capacities neuro-anatomically necessary for the emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans .
opinions are divided as to where in biological evolution consciousness emerged and about whether or not consciousness has any survival value .
some argue that consciousness is a byproduct of evolution .
it has been argued that consciousness emerged ( i ) exclusively with the first humans , ( ii ) exclusively with the first mammals , ( iii ) independently in mammals and birds , or ( iv ) with the first reptiles .
other authors date the origins of consciousness to the first animals with nervous systems or early vertebrates in the cambrian over *num* million years ago .
donald griffin suggests in his book " animal minds " a gradual evolution of consciousness .
each of these scenarios raises the question of the possible survival value of consciousness .
thomas henry huxley defends in an essay titled " on the hypothesis that animals are automata , and its history " an epiphenomenalist theory of consciousness according to which consciousness is a causally inert effect of neural activity—“as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery” .
to this william james objects in his essay " are we automata ? " by stating an evolutionary argument for mind-brain interaction implying that if the preservation and development of consciousness in the biological evolution is a result of natural selection , it is plausible that consciousness has not only been influenced by neural processes , but has had a survival value itself ; and it could only have had this if it had been efficacious .
karl popper develops in the book " the self and its brain " a similar evolutionary argument .
regarding the primary function of conscious processing , a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information-processing that would otherwise be independent .
this has been called the " integration consensus " .
another example has been proposed by gerald edelman called dynamic core hypothesis which puts emphasis on reentrant connections that reciprocally link areas of the brain in a massively parallel manner .
edelman also stresses the importance of the evolutionary emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans from the historically older trait of primary consciousness which humans share with non-human animals ( see " neural correlates " section above ) .
these theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness : differentiation and unity .
they show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details ( differentiation ) because it integrates those details from our sensory systems , while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts .
however , it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness .
nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays , nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness .
obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously ( e .
g .
, neural activity related to vegetative functions , reflexes , unconscious motor programs , low-level perceptual analyses , etc .
) and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness , as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect .
hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious .
for a review of the differences between conscious and unconscious integrations , see the article of e .
morsella .
as noted earlier , even among writers who consider consciousness to be a well-defined thing , there is widespread dispute about which animals other than humans can be said to possess it .
edelman has described this distinction as that of humans possessing higher-order consciousness while sharing the trait of primary consciousness with non-human animals ( see previous paragraph ) .
thus , any examination of the evolution of consciousness is faced with great difficulties .
nevertheless , some writers have argued that consciousness can be viewed from the standpoint of evolutionary biology as an adaptation in the sense of a trait that increases fitness .
in his article " evolution of consciousness " , john eccles argued that special anatomical and physical properties of the mammalian cerebral cortex gave rise to consciousness ( " [ a ] psychon .
.
.
linked to [ a ] dendron through quantum physics " ) .
bernard baars proposed that once in place , this " recursive " circuitry may have provided a basis for the subsequent development of many of the functions that consciousness facilitates in higher organisms .
peter carruthers has put forth one such potential adaptive advantage gained by conscious creatures by suggesting that consciousness allows an individual to make distinctions between appearance and reality .
this ability would enable a creature to recognize the likelihood that their perceptions are deceiving them ( e .
g .
that water in the distance may be a mirage ) and behave accordingly , and it could also facilitate the manipulation of others by recognizing how things appear to them for both cooperative and devious ends .
other philosophers , however , have suggested that consciousness would not be necessary for any functional advantage in evolutionary processes .
no one has given a causal explanation , they argue , of why it would not be possible for a functionally equivalent non-conscious organism ( i .
e .
, a philosophical zombie ) to achieve the very same survival advantages as a conscious organism .
if evolutionary processes are blind to the difference between function " f " being performed by conscious organism " o " and non-conscious organism " o* " , it is unclear what adaptive advantage consciousness could provide .
as a result , an exaptive explanation of consciousness has gained favor with some theorists that posit consciousness did not evolve as an adaptation but was an exaptation arising as a consequence of other developments such as increases in brain size or cortical rearrangement .
consciousness in this sense has been compared to the blind spot in the retina where it is not an adaption of the retina , but instead just a by-product of the way the retinal axons were wired .
several scholars including pinker , chomsky , edelman , and luria have indicated the importance of the emergence of human language as an important regulative mechanism of learning and memory in the context of the development of higher-order consciousness ( see " neural correlates " section above ) .
there are some brain states in which consciousness seems to be absent , including dreamless sleep , coma , and death .
there are also a variety of circumstances that can change the relationship between the mind and the world in less drastic ways , producing what are known as altered states of consciousness .
some altered states occur naturally ; others can be produced by drugs or brain damage .
altered states can be accompanied by changes in thinking , disturbances in the sense of time , feelings of loss of control , changes in emotional expression , alternations in body image and changes in meaning or significance .
the two most widely accepted altered states are sleep and dreaming .
although dream sleep and non-dream sleep appear very similar to an outside observer , each is associated with a distinct pattern of brain activity , metabolic activity , and eye movement ; each is also associated with a distinct pattern of experience and cognition .
during ordinary non-dream sleep , people who are awakened report only vague and sketchy thoughts , and their experiences do not cohere into a continuous narrative .
during dream sleep , in contrast , people who are awakened report rich and detailed experiences in which events form a continuous progression , which may however be interrupted by bizarre or fantastic intrusions .
thought processes during the dream state frequently show a high level of irrationality .
both dream and non-dream states are associated with severe disruption of memory : it usually disappears in seconds during the non-dream state , and in minutes after awakening from a dream unless actively refreshed .
research conducted on the effects of partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that patients who suffer from partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness .
in partial epileptic seizures , consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects of consciousness , often automated behaviors , remain intact .
studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures , patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure , followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention .
a variety of psychoactive drugs , including alcohol , have notable effects on consciousness .
these range from a simple dulling of awareness produced by sedatives , to increases in the intensity of sensory qualities produced by stimulants , cannabis , empathogens–entactogens such as mdma ( " ecstasy " ) , or most notably by the class of drugs known as psychedelics .
lsd , mescaline , psilocybin , dimethyltryptamine , and others in this group can produce major distortions of perception , including hallucinations ; some users even describe their drug-induced experiences as mystical or spiritual in quality .
the brain mechanisms underlying these effects are not as well understood as those induced by use of alcohol , but there is substantial evidence that alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter serotonin play an essential role .
there has been some research into physiological changes in yogis and people who practise various techniques of meditation .
some research with brain waves during meditation has reported differences between those corresponding to ordinary relaxation and those corresponding to meditation .
it has been disputed , however , whether there is enough evidence to count these as physiologically distinct states of consciousness .
the most extensive study of the characteristics of altered states of consciousness was made by psychologist charles tart in the 1960s and 1970s .
tart analyzed a state of consciousness as made up of a number of component processes , including exteroception ( sensing the external world ) ; interoception ( sensing the body ) ; input-processing ( seeing meaning ) ; emotions ; memory ; time sense ; sense of identity ; evaluation and cognitive processing ; motor output ; and interaction with the environment .
each of these , in his view , could be altered in multiple ways by drugs or other manipulations .
the components that tart identified have not , however , been validated by empirical studies .
research in this area has not yet reached firm conclusions , but a recent questionnaire-based study identified eleven significant factors contributing to drug-induced states of consciousness : experience of unity ; spiritual experience ; blissful state ; insightfulness ; disembodiment ; impaired control and cognition ; anxiety ; complex imagery ; elementary imagery ; audio-visual synesthesia ; and changed meaning of percepts .
phenomenology is a method of inquiry that attempts to examine the structure of consciousness in its own right , putting aside problems regarding the relationship of consciousness to the physical world .
this approach was first proposed by the philosopher edmund husserl , and later elaborated by other philosophers and scientists .
husserl's original concept gave rise to two distinct lines of inquiry , in philosophy and psychology .
in philosophy , phenomenology has largely been devoted to fundamental metaphysical questions , such as the nature of intentionality ( " "aboutness" " ) .
in psychology , phenomenology largely has meant attempting to investigate consciousness using the method of introspection , which means looking into one's own mind and reporting what one observes .
this method fell into disrepute in the early twentieth century because of grave doubts about its reliability , but has been rehabilitated to some degree , especially when used in combination with techniques for examining brain activity .
introspectively , the world of conscious experience seems to have considerable structure .
immanuel kant asserted that the world as we perceive it is organized according to a set of fundamental " intuitions " , which include ' object ' ( we perceive the world as a set of distinct things ) ; ' shape ' ; ' quality ' ( color , warmth , etc .
) ; ' space ' ( distance , direction , and location ) ; and ' time ' .
some of these constructs , such as space and time , correspond to the way the world is structured by the laws of physics ; for others the correspondence is not as clear .
understanding the physical basis of qualities , such as redness or pain , has been particularly challenging .
david chalmers has called this the hard problem of consciousness .
some philosophers have argued that it is intrinsically unsolvable , because qualities ( " qualia " ) are ineffable ; that is , they are " raw feels " , incapable of being analyzed into component processes .
other psychologists and neuroscientists reject these arguments .
for example , research on ideasthesia shows that qualia are organised into a semantic-like network .
nevertheless , it is clear that the relationship between a physical entity such as light and a perceptual quality such as color is extraordinarily complex and indirect , as demonstrated by a variety of optical illusions such as neon color spreading .
in neuroscience , a great deal of effort has gone into investigating how the perceived world of conscious awareness is constructed inside the brain .
the process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms : ( *num* ) hierarchical processing of sensory inputs , and ( *num* ) memory .
signals arising from sensory organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages , which extract multiple types of information from the raw input .
in the visual system , for example , sensory signals from the eyes are transmitted to the thalamus and then to the primary visual cortex ; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three-dimensional structure , shape , color , and motion .
memory comes into play in at least two ways .
first , it allows sensory information to be evaluated in the context of previous experience .
second , and even more importantly , working memory allows information to be integrated over time so that it can generate a stable representation of the world—gerald edelman expressed this point vividly by titling one of his books about consciousness " the remembered present " .
in computational neuroscience , bayesian approaches to brain function have been used to understand both the evaluation of sensory information in light of previous experience , and the integration of information over time .
bayesian models of the brain are probabilistic inference models , in which the brain takes advantage of prior knowledge to interpret uncertain sensory inputs in order to formulate a conscious percept ; bayesian models have successfully predicted many perceptual phenomena in vision and the nonvisual senses .
despite the large amount of information available , many important aspects of perception remain mysterious .
a great deal is known about low-level signal processing in sensory systems .
however , how sensory systems , action systems , and language systems interact are poorly understood .
at a deeper level , there are still basic conceptual issues that remain unresolved .
many scientists have found it difficult to reconcile the fact that information is distributed across multiple brain areas with the apparent unity of consciousness : this is one aspect of the so-called binding problem .
there are also some scientists who have expressed grave reservations about the idea that the brain forms representations of the outside world at all : influential members of this group include psychologist j .
j .
gibson and roboticist rodney brooks , who both argued in favor of " intelligence without representation " .
the medical approach to consciousness is practically oriented .
it derives from a need to treat people whose brain function has been impaired as a result of disease , brain damage , toxins , or drugs .
in medicine , conceptual distinctions are considered useful to the degree that they can help to guide treatments .
whereas the philosophical approach to consciousness focuses on its fundamental nature and its contents , the medical approach focuses on the amount of consciousness a person has : in medicine , consciousness is assessed as a " level " ranging from coma and brain death at the low end , to full alertness and purposeful responsiveness at the high end .
consciousness is of concern to patients and physicians , especially neurologists and anesthesiologists .
patients may suffer from disorders of consciousness , or may need to be anesthetized for a surgical procedure .
physicians may perform consciousness-related interventions such as instructing the patient to sleep , administering general anesthesia , or inducing medical coma .
also , bioethicists may be concerned with the ethical implications of consciousness in medical cases of patients such as the karen ann quinlan case , while neuroscientists may study patients with impaired consciousness in hopes of gaining information about how the brain works .
in medicine , consciousness is examined using a set of procedures known as neuropsychological assessment .
there are two commonly used methods for assessing the level of consciousness of a patient : a simple procedure that requires minimal training , and a more complex procedure that requires substantial expertise .
the simple procedure begins by asking whether the patient is able to move and react to physical stimuli .
if so , the next question is whether the patient can respond in a meaningful way to questions and commands .
if so , the patient is asked for name , current location , and current day and time .
a patient who can answer all of these questions is said to be " alert and oriented times four " ( sometimes denoted " a&ox4 " on a medical chart ) , and is usually considered fully conscious .
the more complex procedure is known as a neurological examination , and is usually carried out by a neurologist in a hospital setting .
a formal neurological examination runs through a precisely delineated series of tests , beginning with tests for basic sensorimotor reflexes , and culminating with tests for sophisticated use of language .
the outcome may be summarized using the glasgow coma scale , which yields a number in the range 3–5 , with a score of *num* to *num* indicating coma , and *num* indicating full consciousness .
the glasgow coma scale has three subscales , measuring the best motor response ( ranging from " no motor response " to " obeys commands " ) , the best eye response ( ranging from " no eye opening " to " eyes opening spontaneously " ) and the best verbal response ( ranging from " no verbal response " to " fully oriented " ) .
there is also a simpler pediatric version of the scale , for children too young to be able to use language .
in *num* , an experimental procedure was developed to measure degrees of consciousness , the procedure involving stimulating the brain with a magnetic pulse , measuring resulting waves of electrical activity , and developing a consciousness score based on the complexity of the brain activity .
medical conditions that inhibit consciousness are considered disorders of consciousness .
this category generally includes minimally conscious state and persistent vegetative state , but sometimes also includes the less severe locked-in syndrome and more severe chronic coma .
differential diagnosis of these disorders is an active area of biomedical research .
finally , brain death results in an irreversible disruption of consciousness .
while other conditions may cause a moderate deterioration ( e .
g .
, dementia and delirium ) or transient interruption ( e .
g .
, grand mal and petit mal seizures ) of consciousness , they are not included in this category .
one of the most striking disorders of consciousness goes by the name anosognosia , a greek-derived term meaning ' unawareness of disease ' .
this is a condition in which patients are disabled in some way , most commonly as a result of a stroke , but either misunderstand the nature of the problem or deny that there is anything wrong with them .
the most frequently occurring form is seen in people who have experienced a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in the right hemisphere of the brain , giving rise to a syndrome known as hemispatial neglect , characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their bodies .
patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body , but sometimes deny being unable to move .
when questioned about the obvious problem , the patient may avoid giving a direct answer , or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense .
patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies : one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in , and when asked what he was doing , complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the bed with him .
an even more striking type of anosognosia is anton–babinski syndrome , a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally , and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary .
william james is usually credited with popularizing the idea that human consciousness flows like a stream , in his " principles of psychology " of *num* .
according to james , the " stream of thought " is governed by five characteristics : " ( *num* ) every thought tends to be part of a personal consciousness .
( *num* ) within each personal consciousness thought is always changing .
( *num* ) within each personal consciousness thought is sensibly continuous .
( *num* ) it always appears to deal with objects independent of itself .
( *num* ) it is interested in some parts of these objects to the exclusion of others " .
a similar concept appears in buddhist philosophy , expressed by the sanskrit term " citta-saṃtāna " , which is usually translated as mindstream or " mental continuum " .
buddhist teachings describe that consciousness manifests moment to moment as sense impressions and mental phenomena that are continuously changing .
the teachings list six triggers that can result in the generation of different mental events .
these triggers are input from the five senses ( seeing , hearing , smelling , tasting or touch sensations ) , or a thought ( relating to the past , present or the future ) that happen to arise in the mind .
the mental events generated as a result of these triggers are : feelings , perceptions and intentions / behaviour .
the moment-by-moment manifestation of the mind-stream is said to happen in every person all the time .
it even happens in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world , or analyses the material body including the organ brain .
the manifestation of the mindstream is also described as being influenced by physical laws , biological laws , psychological laws , volitional laws , and universal laws .
the purpose of the buddhist practice of mindfulness is to understand the inherent nature of the consciousness and its characteristics .
in the west , the primary impact of the idea has been on literature rather than science : stream of consciousness as a narrative mode means writing in a way that attempts to portray the moment-to-moment thoughts and experiences of a character .
this technique perhaps had its beginnings in the monologues of shakespeare's plays , and reached its fullest development in the novels of james joyce and virginia woolf , although it has also been used by many other noted writers .
here for example is a passage from joyce's ulysses about the thoughts of molly bloom : to most philosophers , the word " consciousness " connotes the relationship between the mind and the world .
to writers on spiritual or religious topics , it frequently connotes the relationship between the mind and god , or the relationship between the mind and deeper truths that are thought to be more fundamental than the physical world .
the mystical psychiatrist richard maurice bucke distinguished between three types of consciousness : ' simple consciousness ' , awareness of the body , possessed by many animals ; ' self consciousness ' , awareness of being aware , possessed only by humans ; and ' cosmic consciousness ' , awareness of the life and order of the universe , possessed only by humans who are enlightened .
many more examples could be given , such as the various levels of spiritual consciousness presented by prem saran satsangi and stuart hameroff .
the most thorough account of the spiritual approach may be ken wilber's book " the spectrum of consciousness " , a comparison of western and eastern ways of thinking about the mind .
wilber described consciousness as a spectrum with ordinary awareness at one end , and more profound types of awareness at higher levels .
euclidean algorithm in mathematics , the euclidean algorithm , or euclid's algorithm , is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor ( gcd ) of two numbers , the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder .
it is named after the ancient greek mathematician euclid , who first described it in his " elements " ( c .
*num* bc ) .
it is an example of an " algorithm " , a step-by-step procedure for performing a calculation according to well-defined rules , and is one of the oldest algorithms in common use .
it can be used to reduce fractions to their simplest form , and is a part of many other number-theoretic and cryptographic calculations .
the euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number .
for example , *num* is the gcd of *num* and *num* ( as *num* = *num* × *num* and *num* = *num* × *num* ) , and the same number *num* is also the gcd of *num* and *num* − *num* = *num* .
since this replacement reduces the larger of the two numbers , repeating this process gives successively smaller pairs of numbers until the two numbers become equal .
when that occurs , they are the gcd of the original two numbers .
by reversing the steps , the gcd can be expressed as a sum of the two original numbers each multiplied by a positive or negative integer , e .
g .
, *num* = *num* × *num* + ( −2 ) × *num* .
the fact that the gcd can always be expressed in this way is known as bézout's identity .
the version of the euclidean algorithm described above ( and by euclid ) can take many subtraction steps to find the gcd when one of the given numbers is much bigger than the other .
a more efficient version of the algorithm shortcuts these steps , instead replacing the larger of the two numbers by its remainder when divided by the smaller of the two ( with this version , the algorithm stops when reaching a zero remainder ) .
with this improvement , the algorithm never requires more steps than five times the number of digits ( base *num* ) of the smaller integer .
this was proven by gabriel lamé in *num* , and marks the beginning of computational complexity theory .
additional methods for improving the algorithm's efficiency were developed in the *ord* century .
the euclidean algorithm has many theoretical and practical applications .
it is used for reducing fractions to their simplest form and for performing division in modular arithmetic .
computations using this algorithm form part of the cryptographic protocols that are used to secure internet communications , and in methods for breaking these cryptosystems by factoring large composite numbers .
the euclidean algorithm may be used to solve diophantine equations , such as finding numbers that satisfy multiple congruences according to the chinese remainder theorem , to construct continued fractions , and to find accurate rational approximations to real numbers .
finally , it can be used as a basic tool for proving theorems in number theory such as lagrange's four-square theorem and the uniqueness of prime factorizations .
the original algorithm was described only for natural numbers and geometric lengths ( real numbers ) , but the algorithm was generalized in the *ord* century to other types of numbers , such as gaussian integers and polynomials of one variable .
this led to modern abstract algebraic notions such as euclidean domains .
the euclidean algorithm calculates the greatest common divisor ( gcd ) of two natural numbers " a " and " b " .
the greatest common divisor " g " is the largest natural number that divides both " a " and " b " without leaving a remainder .
synonyms for the gcd include the " greatest common factor " ( gcf ) , the " highest common factor " ( hcf ) , the " highest common divisor " ( hcd ) , and the " greatest common measure " ( gcm ) .
the greatest common divisor is often written as gcd ( " a " , "b " ) or , more simply , as ( " a " , "b " ) , although the latter notation is ambiguous , also used for concepts such as an ideal in the ring of integers , which is closely related to gcd .
if gcd ( " a " , "b " ) = *num* , then " a " and " b " are said to be coprime ( or relatively prime ) .
this property does not imply that " a " or " b " are themselves prime numbers .
for example , neither *num* nor *num* is a prime number , since they both have two prime factors : *num* = *num* × *num* and *num* = *num* × *num* .
nevertheless , *num* and *num* are coprime .
no natural number other than *num* divides both *num* and *num* , since they have no prime factors in common .
let " g " = gcd ( " a " , "b " ) .
since " a " and " b " are both multiples of " g " , they can be written " a" = "mg " and " b" = "ng " , and there is no larger number " g" "g " for which this is true .
the natural numbers " m " and " n " must be coprime , since any common factor could be factored out of " m " and " n " to make " g " greater .
thus , any other number " c " that divides both " a " and " b " must also divide " g " .
the greatest common divisor " g " of " a " and " b " is the unique ( positive ) common divisor of " a " and " b " that is divisible by any other common divisor " c " .
the gcd can be visualized as follows .
consider a rectangular area " a " by " b " , and any common divisor " c " that divides both " a " and " b " exactly .
the sides of the rectangle can be divided into segments of length " c " , which divides the rectangle into a grid of squares of side length " c " .
the greatest common divisor " g " is the largest value of " c " for which this is possible .
for illustration , a 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of : 1-by-1 squares , 2-by-2 squares , 3-by-3 squares , 4-by-4 squares , 6-by-6 squares or 12-by-12 squares .
therefore , *num* is the greatest common divisor of *num* and *num* .
a 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of 12-by-12 squares , with two squares along one edge ( *num* / *num* = *num* ) and five squares along the other ( *num* / *num* = *num* ) .
the gcd of two numbers " a " and " b " is the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers , where a same prime factor can be used multiple times , but only as long as the product of these factors divides both " a " and " b " .
for example , since *num* can be factored into *num* × *num* × *num* × *num* × *num* , and *num* can be factored into *num* × *num* × *num* × *num* × *num* , the greatest common divisor of *num* and *num* equals *num* = *num* × *num* × *num* , the product of their shared prime factors .
if two numbers have no prime factors in common , their greatest common divisor is *num* ( obtained here as an instance of the empty product ) , in other words they are coprime .
a key advantage of the euclidean algorithm is that it can find the gcd efficiently without having to compute the prime factors .
factorization of large integers is believed to be a computationally very difficult problem , and the security of many widely used cryptographic protocols is based upon its infeasibility .
another definition of the gcd is helpful in advanced mathematics , particularly ring theory .
the greatest common divisor " g" of two nonzero numbers " a " and " b " is also their smallest positive integral linear combination , that is , the smallest positive number of the form " ua" + "vb " where " u " and " v " are integers .
the set of all integral linear combinations of " a " and " b " is actually the same as the set of all multiples of " g " ( " mg " , where " m " is an integer ) .
in modern mathematical language , the ideal generated by " a " and " b " is the ideal generated by "g " alone ( an ideal generated by a single element is called a principal ideal , and all ideals of the integers are principal ideals ) .
some properties of the gcd are in fact easier to see with this description , for instance the fact that any common divisor of " a " and " b " also divides the gcd ( it divides both terms of " ua" + "vb " ) .
the equivalence of this gcd definition with the other definitions is described below .
the gcd of three or more numbers equals the product of the prime factors common to all the numbers , but it can also be calculated by repeatedly taking the gcds of pairs of numbers .
for example , thus , euclid's algorithm , which computes the gcd of two integers , suffices to calculate the gcd of arbitrarily many integers .
the euclidean algorithm proceeds in a series of steps such that the output of each step is used as an input for the next one .
let " k " be an integer that counts the steps of the algorithm , starting with zero .
thus , the initial step corresponds to " k" = *num* , the next step corresponds to " k" = *num* , and so on .
each step begins with two nonnegative remainders " r " and " r " .
since the algorithm ensures that the remainders decrease steadily with every step , " r " is less than its predecessor " r " .
the goal of the " k"th step is to find a quotient " q " and remainder " r " that satisfy the equation and that have " r" "r " .
in other words , multiples of the smaller number " r " are subtracted from the larger number " r " until the remainder " r " is smaller than " r " .
in the initial step ( " k" = *num* ) , the remainders " r " and " r " equal " a " and " b " , the numbers for which the gcd is sought .
in the next step ( " k" = *num* ) , the remainders equal " b " and the remainder " r " of the initial step , and so on .
thus , the algorithm can be written as a sequence of equations if " a " is smaller than " b " , the first step of the algorithm swaps the numbers .
for example , if " a" "b " , the initial quotient " q " equals zero , and the remainder " r " is " a " .
thus , " r " is smaller than its predecessor " r " for all " k" ≥ *num* .
since the remainders decrease with every step but can never be negative , a remainder " r " must eventually equal zero , at which point the algorithm stops .
the final nonzero remainder " r " is the greatest common divisor of " a " and " b " .
the number " n " cannot be infinite because there are only a finite number of nonnegative integers between the initial remainder " r " and zero .
the validity of the euclidean algorithm can be proven by a two-step argument .
in the first step , the final nonzero remainder " r " is shown to divide both " a " and " b " .
since it is a common divisor , it must be less than or equal to the greatest common divisor " g " .
in the second step , it is shown that any common divisor of " a " and " b " , including " g " , must divide " r " ; therefore , " g " must be less than or equal to " r " .
these two conclusions are inconsistent unless " r" = "g " .
to demonstrate that " r " divides both " a " and " b " ( the first step ) , " r " divides its predecessor " r" since the final remainder " r " is zero .
" r " also divides its next predecessor " r" because it divides both terms on the right-hand side of the equation .
iterating the same argument , " r " divides all the preceding remainders , including " a " and " b " .
none of the preceding remainders " r " , " r " , etc .
divide " a " and " b " , since they leave a remainder .
since " r " is a common divisor of " a " and " b " , " r" ≤ "g " .
in the second step , any natural number " c " that divides both " a " and " b " ( in other words , any common divisor of " a " and " b " ) divides the remainders " r " .
by definition , " a " and " b " can be written as multiples of " c " : " a" = "mc " and " b" = "nc " , where " m " and " n " are natural numbers .
therefore , " c " divides the initial remainder " r " , since " r" = "a" − "q""b" = "mc" − "q""nc" = ( " m" − "q""n " ) " c " .
an analogous argument shows that " c " also divides the subsequent remainders " r " , " r " , etc .
therefore , the greatest common divisor " g " must divide " r " , which implies that " g" ≤ "r " .
since the first part of the argument showed the reverse ( " r" ≤ "g " ) , it follows that " g" = "r " .
thus , " g " is the greatest common divisor of all the succeeding pairs : for illustration , the euclidean algorithm can be used to find the greatest common divisor of " a" = *num* and " b" = *num* .
to begin , multiples of *num* are subtracted from *num* until the remainder is less than *num* .
two such multiples can be subtracted ( " q" = *num* ) , leaving a remainder of *num* : then multiples of *num* are subtracted from *num* until the remainder is less than *num* .
three multiples can be subtracted ( " q" = *num* ) , leaving a remainder of *num* : then multiples of *num* are subtracted from *num* until the remainder is less than *num* .
seven multiples can be subtracted ( " q" = *num* ) , leaving no remainder : since the last remainder is zero , the algorithm ends with *num* as the greatest common divisor of *num* and *num* .
this agrees with the gcd ( *num* , *num* ) found by prime factorization above .
in tabular form , the steps are the euclidean algorithm can be visualized in terms of the tiling analogy given above for the greatest common divisor .
assume that we wish to cover an " a"-by-"b " rectangle with square tiles exactly , where " a " is the larger of the two numbers .
we first attempt to tile the rectangle using " b"-by-"b " square tiles ; however , this leaves an " r"-by-"b " residual rectangle untiled , where " r" "b " .
we then attempt to tile the residual rectangle with " r"-by-"r " square tiles .
this leaves a second residual rectangle " r"-by-"r " , which we attempt to tile using " r"-by-"r " square tiles , and so on .
the sequence ends when there is no residual rectangle , i .
e .
, when the square tiles cover the previous residual rectangle exactly .
the length of the sides of the smallest square tile is the gcd of the dimensions of the original rectangle .
for example , the smallest square tile in the adjacent figure is 21-by-21 ( shown in red ) , and *num* is the gcd of *num* and *num* , the dimensions of the original rectangle ( shown in green ) .
at every step " k " , the euclidean algorithm computes a quotient " q " and remainder " r " from two numbers " r " and " r" where the magnitude of " r " is strictly less than that of " r " .
the theorem which underlies the definition of the euclidean division ensures that such a quotient and remainder always exist and are unique .
in euclid's original version of the algorithm , the quotient and remainder are found by repeated subtraction ; that is , " r " is subtracted from " r " repeatedly until the remainder " r " is smaller than " r " .
after that " r " and " r " are exchanged and the process is iterated .
euclidean division reduces all the steps between two exchanges into a single step , which is thus more efficient .
moreover , the quotients are not needed , thus one may replace euclidean division by the modulo operation , which gives only the remainder .
thus the iteration of the euclidean algorithm becomes simply implementations of the algorithm may be expressed in pseudocode .
for example , the division-based version may be programmed as at the beginning of the " k"th iteration , the variable " b " holds the latest remainder " r " , whereas the variable " a " holds its predecessor , " r " .
the step " b " : = " a " mod " b " is equivalent to the above recursion formula " r " ≡ " r " mod " r " .
the temporary variable " t " holds the value of " r " while the next remainder " r " is being calculated .
at the end of the loop iteration , the variable " b " holds the remainder " r " , whereas the variable " a " holds its predecessor , " r " .
in the subtraction-based version which was euclid's original version , the remainder calculation ( " b" = "a " mod " b " ) is replaced by repeated subtraction .
contrary to the division-based version , which works with arbitrary integers as input , the subtraction-based version supposes that the input consists of positive integers and stops when " a " = " b " : the variables " a " and " b " alternate holding the previous remainders " r " and " r " .
assume that " a " is larger than " b " at the beginning of an iteration ; then " a " equals " r " , since " r " " r " .
during the loop iteration , " a " is reduced by multiples of the previous remainder " b " until " a " is smaller than " b " .
then " a " is the next remainder " r " .
then " b " is reduced by multiples of " a " until it is again smaller than " a " , giving the next remainder " r " , and so on .
the recursive version is based on the equality of the gcds of successive remainders and the stopping condition gcd ( " r " , *num* ) = "r " .
for illustration , the gcd ( *num* , *num* ) is calculated from the equivalent gcd ( *num* , *num* mod *num* ) = gcd ( *num* , *num* ) .
the latter gcd is calculated from the gcd ( *num* , *num* mod *num* ) = gcd ( *num* , *num* ) , which in turn is calculated from the gcd ( *num* , *num* mod *num* ) = gcd ( *num* , *num* ) = *num* .
in another version of euclid's algorithm , the quotient at each step is increased by one if the resulting negative remainder is smaller in magnitude than the typical positive remainder .
previously , the equation assumed that .
however , an alternative negative remainder can be computed : if or if .
if is replaced by when , then one gets a variant of euclidean algorithm such that at each step .
leopold kronecker has shown that this version requires the least number of steps of any version of euclid's algorithm .
more generally , it has been proven that , for every input numbers " a " and " b " , the number of steps is minimal if and only if is chosen in order that formula_3 where formula_4 is the golden ratio .
the euclidean algorithm is one of the oldest algorithms in common use .
it appears in euclid's " elements " ( c .
*num* bc ) , specifically in book *num* ( propositions 1–2 ) and book *num* ( propositions 2–3 ) .
in book *num* , the algorithm is formulated for integers , whereas in book *num* , it is formulated for lengths of line segments .
( in modern usage , one would say it was formulated there for real numbers .
but lengths , areas , and volumes , represented as real numbers in modern usage , are not measured in the same units and there is no natural unit of length , area , or volume ; the concept of real numbers was unknown at that time .
) the latter algorithm is geometrical .
the gcd of two lengths " a " and " b " corresponds to the greatest length " g " that measures " a " and " b " evenly ; in other words , the lengths " a " and " b " are both integer multiples of the length "g " .
the algorithm was probably not discovered by euclid , who compiled results from earlier mathematicians in his " elements " .
the mathematician and historian b .
l .
van der waerden suggests that book vii derives from a textbook on number theory written by mathematicians in the school of pythagoras .
the algorithm was probably known by eudoxus of cnidus ( about *num* bc ) .
the algorithm may even pre-date eudoxus , judging from the use of the technical term ἀνθυφαίρεσις ( " anthyphairesis " , reciprocal subtraction ) in works by euclid and aristotle .
centuries later , euclid's algorithm was discovered independently both in india and in china , primarily to solve diophantine equations that arose in astronomy and making accurate calendars .
in the late *ord* century , the indian mathematician and astronomer aryabhata described the algorithm as the " pulverizer " , perhaps because of its effectiveness in solving diophantine equations .
although a special case of the chinese remainder theorem had already been described in the chinese book " sunzi suanjing " , the general solution was published by qin jiushao in his *num* book " shushu jiuzhang " ( 數書九章 " mathematical treatise in nine sections " ) .
the euclidean algorithm was first described in europe in the second edition of bachet's " problèmes plaisants et délectables " ( " pleasant and enjoyable problems " , *num* ) .
in europe , it was likewise used to solve diophantine equations and in developing continued fractions .
the extended euclidean algorithm was published by the english mathematician nicholas saunderson , who attributed it to roger cotes as a method for computing continued fractions efficiently .
in the *ord* century , the euclidean algorithm led to the development of new number systems , such as gaussian integers and eisenstein integers .
in *num* , carl gauss used the euclidean algorithm to demonstrate unique factorization of gaussian integers , although his work was first published in *num* .
gauss mentioned the algorithm in his " disquisitiones arithmeticae " ( published *num* ) , but only as a method for continued fractions .
peter gustav lejeune dirichlet seems to have been the first to describe the euclidean algorithm as the basis for much of number theory .
lejeune dirichlet noted that many results of number theory , such as unique factorization , would hold true for any other system of numbers to which the euclidean algorithm could be applied .
lejeune dirichlet's lectures on number theory were edited and extended by richard dedekind , who used euclid's algorithm to study algebraic integers , a new general type of number .
for example , dedekind was the first to prove fermat's two-square theorem using the unique factorization of gaussian integers .
dedekind also defined the concept of a euclidean domain , a number system in which a generalized version of the euclidean algorithm can be defined ( as described below ) .
in the closing decades of the *ord* century , the euclidean algorithm gradually became eclipsed by dedekind's more general theory of ideals .
other applications of euclid's algorithm were developed in the *ord* century .
in *num* , charles sturm showed that the algorithm was useful in the sturm chain method for counting the real roots of polynomials in any given interval .
the euclidean algorithm was the first integer relation algorithm , which is a method for finding integer relations between commensurate real numbers .
several novel integer relation algorithms have been developed , such as the algorithm of helaman ferguson and r .
w .
forcade ( *num* ) and the lll algorithm .
in *num* , cole and davie developed a two-player game based on the euclidean algorithm , called " the game of euclid " , which has an optimal strategy .
the players begin with two piles of " a " and " b " stones .
the players take turns removing " m " multiples of the smaller pile from the larger .
thus , if the two piles consist of " x " and " y " stones , where " x " is larger than " y " , the next player can reduce the larger pile from " x " stones to " x " − " my " stones , as long as the latter is a nonnegative integer .
the winner is the first player to reduce one pile to zero stones .
bézout's identity states that the greatest common divisor " g " of two integers " a " and " b " can be represented as a linear sum of the original two numbers " a " and " b " .
in other words , it is always possible to find integers " s " and " t " such that " g" = "sa" + "tb " .
the integers " s " and " t " can be calculated from the quotients " q " , " q " , etc .
by reversing the order of equations in euclid's algorithm .
beginning with the next-to-last equation , " g " can be expressed in terms of the quotient " q " and the two preceding remainders , " r " and " r " : those two remainders can be likewise expressed in terms of their quotients and preceding remainders , substituting these formulae for " r " and " r " into the first equation yields " g " as a linear sum of the remainders " r " and " r " .
the process of substituting remainders by formulae involving their predecessors can be continued until the original numbers " a " and " b " are reached : after all the remainders " r " , " r " , etc .
have been substituted , the final equation expresses " g " as a linear sum of " a " and " b " : " g" = "sa" + "tb " .
bézout's identity , and therefore the previous algorithm , can both be generalized to the context of euclidean domains .
bézout's identity provides yet another definition of the greatest common divisor " g " of two numbers " a " and " b " .
consider the set of all numbers " ua" + "vb " , where " u " and " v " are any two integers .
since " a " and " b " are both divisible by " g " , every number in the set is divisible by " g " .
in other words , every number of the set is an integer multiple of " g " .
this is true for every common divisor of " a " and " b " .
however , unlike other common divisors , the greatest common divisor is a member of the set ; by bézout's identity , choosing " u" = "s " and " v" = "t " gives " g " .
a smaller common divisor cannot be a member of the set , since every member of the set must be divisible by " g " .
conversely , any multiple " m " of " g " can be obtained by choosing " u" = "ms " and " v" = "mt " , where " s " and " t " are the integers of bézout's identity .
this may be seen by multiplying bézout's identity by " m " , therefore , the set of all numbers " ua" + "vb " is equivalent to the set of multiples " m " of " g " .
in other words , the set of all possible sums of integer multiples of two numbers ( " a " and " b " ) is equivalent to the set of multiples of gcd ( " a " , " b " ) .
the gcd is said to be the generator of the ideal of " a " and " b " .
this gcd definition led to the modern abstract algebraic concepts of a principal ideal ( an ideal generated by a single element ) and a principal ideal domain ( a domain in which every ideal is a principal ideal ) .
certain problems can be solved using this result .
for example , consider two measuring cups of volume " a " and " b " .
by adding / subtracting " u " multiples of the first cup and " v " multiples of the second cup , any volume " ua" + "vb " can be measured out .
these volumes are all multiples of " g" = gcd ( " a " , "b " ) .
the integers " s " and " t " of bézout's identity can be computed efficiently using the extended euclidean algorithm .
this extension adds two recursive equations to euclid's algorithm with the starting values using this recursion , bézout's integers " s " and " t " are given by " s" = "s " and " t" = "t " , where " n+1 " is the step on which the algorithm terminates with " r" = *num* .
the validity of this approach can be shown by induction .
assume that the recursion formula is correct up to step " k" − *num* of the algorithm ; in other words , assume that for all " j " less than " k " .
the " k"th step of the algorithm gives the equation since the recursion formula has been assumed to be correct for " r " and " r " , they may be expressed in terms of the corresponding " s " and " t " variables rearranging this equation yields the recursion formula for step " k " , as required the integers " s " and " t " can also be found using an equivalent matrix method .
the sequence of equations of euclid's algorithm can be written as a product of 2-by-2 quotient matrices multiplying a two-dimensional remainder vector let m represent the product of all the quotient matrices this simplifies the euclidean algorithm to the form to express " g " as a linear sum of " a " and " b " , both sides of this equation can be multiplied by the inverse of the matrix m .
the determinant of m equals ( −1 ) , since it equals the product of the determinants of the quotient matrices , each of which is negative one .
since the determinant of m is never zero , the vector of the final remainders can be solved using the inverse of m since the top equation gives the two integers of bézout's identity are " s" = ( −1 ) " m " and " t" = ( −1 ) " m " .
the matrix method is as efficient as the equivalent recursion , with two multiplications and two additions per step of the euclidean algorithm .
bézout's identity is essential to many applications of euclid's algorithm , such as demonstrating the unique factorization of numbers into prime factors .
to illustrate this , suppose that a number " l " can be written as a product of two factors " u " and " v " , that is , " l" = "uv " .
if another number " w " also divides " l " but is coprime with " u " , then " w " must divide " v " , by the following argument : if the greatest common divisor of " u " and " w " is *num* , then integers " s " and " t " can be found such that by bézout's identity .
multiplying both sides by " v " gives the relation since " w " divides both terms on the right-hand side , it must also divide the left-hand side , " v " .
this result is known as euclid's lemma .
specifically , if a prime number divides " l " , then it must divide at least one factor of " l " .
conversely , if a number " w " is coprime to each of a series of numbers " a " , " a " , .
.
.
, " a " , then " w " is also coprime to their product , " a" × "a" × .
.
.
× "a " .
euclid's lemma suffices to prove that every number has a unique factorization into prime numbers .
to see this , assume the contrary , that there are two independent factorizations of " l " into " m " and " n " prime factors , respectively since each prime " p " divides " l " by assumption , it must also divide one of the " q " factors ; since each " q " is prime as well , it must be that " p" = "q " .
iteratively dividing by the " p " factors shows that each " p " has an equal counterpart " q " ; the two prime factorizations are identical except for their order .
the unique factorization of numbers into primes has many applications in mathematical proofs , as shown below .
diophantine equations are equations in which the solutions are restricted to integers ; they are named after the 3rd-century alexandrian mathematician diophantus .
a typical " linear " diophantine equation seeks integers " x " and " y " such that where " a " , " b " and " c " are given integers .
this can be written as an equation for " x " in modular arithmetic : let " g " be the greatest common divisor of " a " and " b " .
both terms in " ax" + "by " are divisible by " g " ; therefore , " c " must also be divisible by " g " , or the equation has no solutions .
by dividing both sides by " c" / "g " , the equation can be reduced to bezout's identity where " s " and " t " can be found by the extended euclidean algorithm .
this provides one solution to the diophantine equation , " x" = "s " ( " c" / "g " ) and " y" = "t " ( " c" / "g " ) .
in general , a linear diophantine equation has no solutions , or an infinite number of solutions .
to find the latter , consider two solutions , ( " x " , "y " ) and ( " x " , "y " ) , where or equivalently therefore , the smallest difference between two " x " solutions is " b" / "g " , whereas the smallest difference between two " y " solutions is " a" / "g " .
thus , the solutions may be expressed as by allowing " u " to vary over all possible integers , an infinite family of solutions can be generated from a single solution ( " x " , "y " ) .
if the solutions are required to be " positive " integers ( " x" *num* , "y" *num* ) , only a finite number of solutions may be possible .
this restriction on the acceptable solutions allows some systems of diophantine equations with more unknowns than equations to have a finite number of solutions ; this is impossible for a system of linear equations when the solutions can be any real number ( see underdetermined system ) .
a finite field is a set of numbers with four generalized operations .
the operations are called addition , subtraction , multiplication and division and have their usual properties , such as commutativity , associativity and distributivity .
an example of a finite field is the set of *num* numbers {0 , *num* , *num* , .

, 12} using modular arithmetic .
in this field , the results of any mathematical operation ( addition , subtraction , multiplication , or division ) is reduced modulo *num* ; that is , multiples of *num* are added or subtracted until the result is brought within the range 0–12 .
for example , the result of *num* × *num* = *num* mod *num* = *num* .
such finite fields can be defined for any prime " p " ; using more sophisticated definitions , they can also be defined for any power " m " of a prime " p " .
finite fields are often called galois fields , and are abbreviated as gf ( " p " ) or gf ( " p " ) .
in such a field with " m " numbers , every nonzero element " a " has a unique modular multiplicative inverse , " a " such that this inverse can be found by solving the congruence equation " ax" ≡ *num* mod "m " , or the equivalent linear diophantine equation this equation can be solved by the euclidean algorithm , as described above .
finding multiplicative inverses is an essential step in the rsa algorithm , which is widely used in electronic commerce ; specifically , the equation determines the integer used to decrypt the message .
note that although the rsa algorithm uses rings rather than fields , the euclidean algorithm can still be used to find a multiplicative inverse where one exists .
the euclidean algorithm also has other applications in error-correcting codes ; for example , it can be used as an alternative to the berlekamp–massey algorithm for decoding bch and reed–solomon codes , which are based on galois fields .
euclid's algorithm can also be used to solve multiple linear diophantine equations .
such equations arise in the chinese remainder theorem , which describes a novel method to represent an integer " x " .
instead of representing an integer by its digits , it may be represented by its remainders " x " modulo a set of " n " coprime numbers " m " : the goal is to determine " x " from its " n " remainders " x " .
the solution is to combine the multiple equations into a single linear diophantine equation with a much larger modulus " m " that is the product of all the individual moduli " m " , and define " m " as thus , each " m " is the product of all the moduli " except " " m " .
the solution depends on finding " n " new numbers " h " such that with these numbers " h " , any integer " x " can be reconstructed from its remainders " x " by the equation since these numbers " h " are the multiplicative inverses of the " m " , they may be found using euclid's algorithm as described in the previous subsection .
the euclidean algorithm can be used to arrange the set of all positive rational numbers into an infinite binary search tree , called the stern–brocot tree .
the number *num* ( expressed as a fraction *num* / *num* ) is placed at the root of the tree , and the location of any other number " a" / "b " can be found by computing gcd ( " a " , " b " ) using the original form of the euclidean algorithm , in which each step replaces the larger of the two given numbers by its difference with the smaller number ( not its remainder ) , stopping when two equal numbers are reached .
a step of the euclidean algorithm that replaces the first of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its right child , and a step that replaces the second of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its left child .
the sequence of steps constructed in this way does not depend on whether " a" / "b " is given in lowest terms , and forms a path from the root to a node containing the number " a" / "b " .
this fact can be used to prove that each positive rational number appears exactly once in this tree .
for example , *num* / *num* can be found by starting at the root , going to the left once , then to the right twice : the euclidean algorithm has almost the same relationship to another binary tree on the rational numbers called the calkin–wilf tree .
the difference is that the path is reversed : instead of producing a path from the root of the tree to a target , it produces a path from the target to the root .
the euclidean algorithm has a close relationship with continued fractions .
the sequence of equations can be written in the form the last term on the right-hand side always equals the inverse of the left-hand side of the next equation .
thus , the first two equations may be combined to form the third equation may be used to substitute the denominator term " r" / "r " , yielding the final ratio of remainders " r" / "r " can always be replaced using the next equation in the series , up to the final equation .
the result is a continued fraction in the worked example above , the gcd ( *num* , *num* ) was calculated , and the quotients " q " were *num* , *num* and *num* , respectively .
therefore , the fraction *num* / *num* may be written as can be confirmed by calculation .
calculating a greatest common divisor is an essential step in several integer factorization algorithms , such as pollard's rho algorithm , shor's algorithm , dixon's factorization method and the lenstra elliptic curve factorization .
the euclidean algorithm may be used to find this gcd efficiently .
continued fraction factorization uses continued fractions , which are determined using euclid's algorithm .
the computational efficiency of euclid's algorithm has been studied thoroughly .
this efficiency can be described by the number of division steps the algorithm requires , multiplied by the computational expense of each step .
the first known analysis of euclid's algorithm is due to a .
a .
l .
reynaud in *num* , who showed that the number of division steps on input ( " u " , " v " ) is bounded by " v " ; later he improved this to " v" / *num* + *num* .
later , in *num* , p .
j .
e .
finck showed that the number of division steps is at most *num* log "v" + *num* , and hence euclid's algorithm runs in time polynomial in the size of the input .
émile léger , in *num* , studied the worst case , which is when the inputs are consecutive fibonacci numbers .
finck's analysis was refined by gabriel lamé in *num* , who showed that the number of steps required for completion is never more than five times the number " h " of base-10 digits of the smaller number "b " .
in the uniform cost model ( suitable for analyzing the complexity of gcd calculation on numbers that fit into a single machine word ) , each step of the algorithm takes constant time , and lamé's analysis implies that the total running time is also " o " ( " h " ) .
however , in a model of computation suitable for computation with larger numbers , the computational expense of a single remainder computation in the algorithm can be as large as " o " ( " h " ) .
in this case the total time for all of the steps of the algorithm can be analyzed using a telescoping series , showing that it is also " o " ( " h " ) .
modern algorithmic techniques based on the schönhage–strassen algorithm for fast integer multiplication can be used to speed this up , leading to quasilinear algorithms for the gcd .
the number of steps to calculate the gcd of two natural numbers , " a " and " b " , may be denoted by " t " ( " a " , "b " ) .
if " g " is the gcd of " a " and " b " , then " a" = "mg " and " b" = "ng " for two coprime numbers " m " and " n " .
then as may be seen by dividing all the steps in the euclidean algorithm by " g " .
by the same argument , the number of steps remains the same if " a " and " b " are multiplied by a common factor " w " : " t " ( " a " , " b " ) = " t " ( " wa " , " wb " ) .
therefore , the number of steps " t " may vary dramatically between neighboring pairs of numbers , such as t ( " a " , " b " ) and t ( " a " , "b" + *num* ) , depending on the size of the two gcds .
the recursive nature of the euclidean algorithm gives another equation where " t " ( " x " , *num* ) = *num* by assumption .
if the euclidean algorithm requires " n " steps for a pair of natural numbers " a" "b" *num* , the smallest values of " a " and " b " for which this is true are the fibonacci numbers " f " and " f " , respectively .
more precisely , if the euclidean algorithm requires " n " steps for the pair " a" "b " , then one has " a" ≥ "f " and " b" ≥ "f " .
this can be shown by induction .
if " n" = *num* , " b " divides " a " with no remainder ; the smallest natural numbers for which this is true is " b" = *num* and " a" = *num* , which are " f " and " f " , respectively .
now assume that the result holds for all values of " n " up to " m" − *num* .
the first step of the " m"-step algorithm is " a" = "q""b" + "r " , and the euclidean algorithm requires " m" − *num* steps for the pair " b" "r " .
by induction hypothesis , one has " b" ≥ "f " and " r" ≥ "f " .
therefore , " a" = "q""b" + "r" ≥ "b" + "r" ≥ "f" + "f" = "f " , which is the desired inequality .
this proof , published by gabriel lamé in *num* , represents the beginning of computational complexity theory , and also the first practical application of the fibonacci numbers .
this result suffices to show that the number of steps in euclid's algorithm can never be more than five times the number of its digits ( base *num* ) .
for if the algorithm requires " n " steps , then " b " is greater than or equal to " f " which in turn is greater than or equal to " φ " , where " φ " is the golden ratio .
since " b" ≥ "φ " , then " n" − *num* ≤ log"b " .
since log"φ" *num* / *num* , ( " n" − *num* ) / *num* log"φ" log"b" = log"b " .
thus , " n" ≤ *num* log"b " .
thus , the euclidean algorithm always needs less than " o " ( " h " ) divisions , where " h " is the number of digits in the smaller number " b " .
the average number of steps taken by the euclidean algorithm has been defined in three different ways .
the first definition is the average time " t " ( " a " ) required to calculate the gcd of a given number " a " and a smaller natural number " b " chosen with equal probability from the integers *num* to " a" − *num* with the residual error being of order " a " , where " ε " is infinitesimal .
the constant " c " ( " porter's constant " ) in this formula equals where " γ " is the euler–mascheroni constant and ζ ' is the derivative of the riemann zeta function .
the leading coefficient ( *num* / π ) ln *num* was determined by two independent methods .
since the first average can be calculated from the tau average by summing over the divisors " d " of "a" it can be approximated by the formula where λ ( " d " ) is the mangoldt function .
a third average " y " ( " n " ) is defined as the mean number of steps required when both " a " and " b " are chosen randomly ( with uniform distribution ) from *num* to " n" substituting the approximate formula for " t " ( " a " ) into this equation yields an estimate for " y " ( " n " ) in each step " k " of the euclidean algorithm , the quotient " q " and remainder " r " are computed for a given pair of integers " r " and " r" the computational expense per step is associated chiefly with finding " q " , since the remainder " r " can be calculated quickly from " r " , " r " , and " q" the computational expense of dividing " h"-bit numbers scales as " o " ( " h " ( " ℓ"+1 ) ) , where " ℓ " is the length of the quotient .
for comparison , euclid's original subtraction-based algorithm can be much slower .
a single integer division is equivalent to the quotient " q " number of subtractions .
if the ratio of " a " and " b " is very large , the quotient is large and many subtractions will be required .
on the other hand , it has been shown that the quotients are very likely to be small integers .
the probability of a given quotient " q " is approximately ln|"u" / ( " u" − *num* ) | where " u" = ( " q" + *num* ) .
for illustration , the probability of a quotient of *num* , *num* , *num* , or *num* is roughly *num* .
*num* % , *num* .
*num* % , *num* .
*num* % , and *num* .
*num* % , respectively .
since the operation of subtraction is faster than division , particularly for large numbers , the subtraction-based euclid's algorithm is competitive with the division-based version .
this is exploited in the binary version of euclid's algorithm .
combining the estimated number of steps with the estimated computational expense per step shows that the euclid's algorithm grows quadratically ( " h " ) with the average number of digits " h " in the initial two numbers " a " and " b " .
let " h " , " h " , .
.
.
, " h " represent the number of digits in the successive remainders " r " , "r " , .
.
.
, "r " .
since the number of steps " n " grows linearly with " h " , the running time is bounded by euclid's algorithm is widely used in practice , especially for small numbers , due to its simplicity .
for comparison , the efficiency of alternatives to euclid's algorithm may be determined .
one inefficient approach to finding the gcd of two natural numbers " a " and " b " is to calculate all their common divisors ; the gcd is then the largest common divisor .
the common divisors can be found by dividing both numbers by successive integers from *num* to the smaller number " b " .
the number of steps of this approach grows linearly with " b " , or exponentially in the number of digits .
another inefficient approach is to find the prime factors of one or both numbers .
as noted above , the gcd equals the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers " a " and " b " .
present methods for prime factorization are also inefficient ; many modern cryptography systems even rely on that inefficiency .
the binary gcd algorithm is an efficient alternative that substitutes division with faster operations by exploiting the binary representation used by computers .
however , this alternative also scales like " o " ( " h"² ) .
it is generally faster than the euclidean algorithm on real computers , even though it scales in the same way .
additional efficiency can be gleaned by examining only the leading digits of the two numbers " a " and " b " .
the binary algorithm can be extended to other bases ( " k"-ary algorithms ) , with up to fivefold increases in speed .
lehmer's gcd algorithm uses the same general principle as the binary algorithm to speed up gcd computations in arbitrary bases .
a recursive approach for very large integers ( with more than *num* , *num* digits ) leads to quasilinear integer gcd algorithms , such as those of schönhage , and stehlé and zimmermann .
these algorithms exploit the 2×2 matrix form of the euclidean algorithm given above .
these quasilinear methods generally scale as although the euclidean algorithm is used to find the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers ( positive integers ) , it may be generalized to the real numbers , and to other mathematical objects , such as polynomials , quadratic integers and hurwitz quaternions .
in the latter cases , the euclidean algorithm is used to demonstrate the crucial property of unique factorization , i .
e .
, that such numbers can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements , the counterparts of prime numbers .
unique factorization is essential to many proofs of number theory .
euclid's algorithm can be applied to real numbers , as described by euclid in book *num* of his " elements " .
the goal of the algorithm is to identify a real number such that two given real numbers , and , are integer multiples of it : and , where and are integers .
this identification is equivalent to finding an integer relation among the real numbers and ; that is , it determines integers and such that .
euclid uses this algorithm to treat the question of incommensurable lengths .
the real-number euclidean algorithm differs from its integer counterpart in two respects .
first , the remainders are real numbers , although the quotients are integers as before .
second , the algorithm is not guaranteed to end in a finite number of steps .
if it does , the fraction is a rational number , i .
e .
, the ratio of two integers and can be written as a finite continued fraction .
if the algorithm does not stop , the fraction is an irrational number and can be described by an infinite continued fraction .
examples of infinite continued fractions are the golden ratio and the square root of two , .
the algorithm is unlikely to stop , since almost all ratios of two real numbers are irrational .
an infinite continued fraction may be truncated at a step to yield an approximation to that improves as is increased .
the approximation is described by convergents ; the numerator and denominators are coprime and obey the recurrence relation where and are the initial values of the recursion .
the convergent is the best rational number approximation to with denominator : polynomials in a single variable " x " can be added , multiplied and factored into irreducible polynomials , which are the analogs of the prime numbers for integers .
the greatest common divisor polynomial of two polynomials and is defined as the product of their shared irreducible polynomials , which can be identified using the euclidean algorithm .
the basic procedure is similar to that for integers .
at each step , a quotient polynomial and a remainder polynomial are identified to satisfy the recursive equation where and .
the quotient polynomial is chosen so that the leading term of equals the leading term of ; this ensures that the degree of each remainder is smaller than the degree of its predecessor : .
since the degree is a nonnegative integer , and since it decreases with every step , the euclidean algorithm concludes in a finite number of steps .
the final nonzero remainder is the greatest common divisor of the original two polynomials , and .
for example , consider the following two quartic polynomials , which each factor into two quadratic polynomials dividing by yields a remainder .
in the next step , is divided by yielding a remainder .
finally , dividing by yields a zero remainder , indicating that is the greatest common divisor polynomial of and , consistent with their factorization .
many of the applications described above for integers carry over to polynomials .
the euclidean algorithm can be used to solve linear diophantine equations and chinese remainder problems for polynomials ; continued fractions of polynomials can also be defined .
the polynomial euclidean algorithm has other applications , such as sturm chains , a method for counting the zeros of a polynomial that lie inside a given real interval .
this in turn has applications in several areas , such as the routh–hurwitz stability criterion in control theory .
finally , the coefficients of the polynomials need not be drawn from integers , real numbers or even the complex numbers .
for example , the coefficients may be drawn from a general field , such as the finite fields described above .
the corresponding conclusions about the euclidean algorithm and its applications hold even for such polynomials .
the gaussian integers are complex numbers of the form , where and are ordinary integers and is the square root of negative one .
by defining an analog of the euclidean algorithm , gaussian integers can be shown to be uniquely factorizable , by the argument above .
this unique factorization is helpful in many applications , such as deriving all pythagorean triples or proving fermat's theorem on sums of two squares .
in general , the euclidean algorithm is convenient in such applications , but not essential ; for example , the theorems can often be proven by other arguments .
the euclidean algorithm developed for two gaussian integers and is nearly the same as that for ordinary integers , but differs in two respects .
as before , the task at each step is to identify a quotient and a remainder such that where , where , and where every remainder is strictly smaller than its predecessor : .
the first difference is that the quotients and remainders are themselves gaussian integers , and thus are complex numbers .
the quotients are generally found by rounding the real and complex parts of the exact ratio ( such as the complex number ) to the nearest integers .
the second difference lies in the necessity of defining how one complex remainder can be " smaller " than another .
to do this , a norm function is defined , which converts every gaussian integer into an ordinary integer .
after each step of the euclidean algorithm , the norm of the remainder is smaller than the norm of the preceding remainder , .
since the norm is a nonnegative integer and decreases with every step , the euclidean algorithm for gaussian integers ends in a finite number of steps .
the final nonzero remainder is , the gaussian integer of largest norm that divides both and ; it is unique up to multiplication by a unit , or .
many of the other applications of the euclidean algorithm carry over to gaussian integers .
for example , it can be used to solve linear diophantine equations and chinese remainder problems for gaussian integers ; continued fractions of gaussian integers can also be defined .
a set of elements under two binary operations , denoted as addition and multiplication , is called a euclidean domain if it forms a commutative ring and , roughly speaking , if a generalized euclidean algorithm can be performed on them .
the two operations of such a ring need not be the addition and multiplication of ordinary arithmetic ; rather , they can be more general , such as the operations of a mathematical group or monoid .
nevertheless , these general operations should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic , such as commutativity , associativity and distributivity .
the generalized euclidean algorithm requires a " euclidean function " , i .
e .
, a mapping from into the set of nonnegative integers such that , for any two nonzero elements and in , there exist and in such that and .
an example of this mapping is the norm function used to order the gaussian integers above .
the function can be the magnitude of the number or the degree of a polynomial .
the basic principle is that each step of the algorithm reduces " f " inexorably ; hence , if can be reduced only a finite number of times , the algorithm must stop in a finite number of steps .
this principle relies on the natural well-ordering of the non-negative integers ; roughly speaking , this requires that every non-empty set of non-negative integers has a smallest member .
the fundamental theorem of arithmetic applies to any euclidean domain : any number from a euclidean domain can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements .
any euclidean domain is a unique factorization domain ( ufd ) , although the converse is not true .
the euclidean domains and the ufd's are subclasses of the gcd domains , domains in which a greatest common divisor of two numbers always exists .
in other words , a greatest common divisor may exist ( for all pairs of elements in a domain ) , although it may not be possible to find it using a euclidean algorithm .
a euclidean domain is always a principal ideal domain ( pid ) , an integral domain in which every ideal is a principal ideal .
again , the converse is not true : not every pid is a euclidean domain .
the unique factorization of euclidean domains is useful in many applications .
for example , the unique factorization of the gaussian integers is convenient in deriving formulae for all pythagorean triples and in proving fermat's theorem on sums of two squares .
unique factorization was also a key element in an attempted proof of fermat's last theorem published in *num* by gabriel lamé , the same mathematician who analyzed the efficiency of euclid's algorithm , based on a suggestion of joseph liouville .
lamé's approach required the unique factorization of numbers of the form , where and are integers , and {2} .
/ if the function corresponds to a norm function , such as that used to order the gaussian integers above , then the domain is known as " norm-euclidean " .
the norm-euclidean rings of quadratic integers are exactly those where is one of the values −11 , −7 , −3 , −2 , −1 , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* , or *num* .
the cases and yield the gaussian integers and eisenstein integers , respectively .
if is allowed to be any euclidean function , then the list of possible values of for which the domain is euclidean is not yet known .
the first example of a euclidean domain that was not norm-euclidean ( with ) was published in *num* .
in *num* , weinberger proved that a quadratic integer ring with is euclidean if , and only if , it is a principal ideal domain , provided that the generalized riemann hypothesis holds .
the euclidean algorithm may be applied to noncommutative rings such as the set of hurwitz quaternions .
let and represent two elements from such a ring .
they have a common right divisor if and for some choice of and in the ring .
similarly , they have a common left divisor if and for some choice of and in the ring .
since multiplication is not commutative , there are two versions of the euclidean algorithm , one for right divisors and one for left divisors .
choosing the right divisors , the first step in finding the by the euclidean algorithm can be written where represents the quotient and the remainder .
this equation shows that any common right divisor of and is likewise a common divisor of the remainder .
the analogous equation for the left divisors would be with either choice , the process is repeated as above until the greatest common right or left divisor is identified .
as in the euclidean domain , the " size " of the remainder must be strictly smaller than , and there must be only a finite number of possible sizes for , so that the algorithm is guaranteed to terminate .
most of the results for the gcd carry over to noncommutative numbers .
for example , bézout's identity states that the right can be expressed as a linear combination of and .
in other words , there are numbers and such that the analogous identity for the left gcd is nearly the same : bézout's identity can be used to solve diophantine equations .
for instance , one of the standard proofs of lagrange's four-square theorem , that every positive integer can be represented as a sum of four squares , is based on quaternion gcds in this way .
central african armed forces the central african armed forces ( ) are the armed forces of the central african republic , established after independence in *num* .
today they are among the world's weakest armed forces , dependent on international support to hold back enemies in the current civil war .
its disloyalty to the president came to the fore during the mutinies in 1996–1997 , and since then has faced internal problems .
it has been strongly criticised by human rights organisations due to terrorism , including killings , torture and sexual violence .
its budget is currently just $15 million adjusted usd per year .
the faca proved to be incompetent in *num* when militants of the séléka rebel coalition seized power and overthrew president bozizé , committing executions of many faca troops .
the military has played an important role in the history of central african republic .
the immediate former president , general françois bozizé was a former army chief-of-staff and his government included several high-level military officers .
among the country's five presidents since independence in *num* , three have been former army chiefs-of-staff , who have taken power through coups d'état .
no president with a military background has , however , ever been succeeded by a new military president .
the country's first president , david dacko was overthrown by his army chief-of-staff , jean-bédel bokassa in *num* .
following bokassa , david dacko was restored in *num* , only to be overthrown once again by his new army chief of staff , general andré kolingba , after only a few months in power .
in *num* , ange-félix patassé became the central african republic's first elected president .
he soon became unpopular within the army , resulting in violent mutinies in 1996–1997 .
in may *num* , there was an unsuccessful coup attempt by kolingba and once again patassé had to turn to friends abroad for support , this time libya and dr congo .
some months later , at the end of october , patassé sacked his army chief-of-staff , françois bozizé , and attempted to arrest him .
bozizé then fled to chad and gathered a group of rebels .
in *num* , he seized bangui for a short period , and in march *num* took power in a coup d'état .
when general kolingba became president in *num* , he implemented an ethnicity-based recruitment policy for the administration .
kolingba was a member of the yakoma people from the south of the country , which made up approximately *num* % of the total population .
during his rule , members of yakoma were granted all key positions in the administration and made up a majority of the military .
this later had disastrous consequences when kolingba was replaced by a member of a northerner tribe , ange-félix patassé .
soon after the election *num* , patassé became unpopular within the army , not least because of his inability to pay their wages ( partly due to economic mismanagement and partly because france suddenly ended its economic support for the soldiers ' wages ) .
another reason for the irritation was that most of faca consisted of soldiers from kolingba's ethnic group , the yakoma .
during patassé's rule they had become increasingly marginalised , while he created militias favouring his own gbaya tribe , as well as neighbouring sara and kaba .
this resulted in army mutinies in 1996–1997 , where fractions of the military clashed with the presidential guard , the " unité de sécurité présidentielle ( usp ) " and militias loyal to patassé .
on *num* december , a negotiation process started , facilitated by gabon , burkina-faso , chad and mali .
the military — supported by the opposition parties — insisted that patassé had to resign .
in january , *num* , however , the bangui agreements were signed and the french efao troop were replaced by the *num* , *num* soldiers of the " mission interafricaine de surveillance des accords de bangui ( misab ) " .
in march , all mutineers were granted amnesty .
the fighting between misab and the mutineers continued with a large offensive in june , resulting in up to *num* casualties .
after this final clash , the mutineers calmed .
after the mutinies , president patassé suffered from a typical " dictator's paranoia " , resulting in a period of cruel terror executed by the presidential guard and various militias within the faca loyal to the president , such as the karako .
the violence was directed against the yakoma tribe , of which it is estimated that *num* , *num* persons fled during this period .
the oppression also targeted other parts of the society .
the president accused his former ally france of supporting his enemies and sought new international ties .
when he strengthened his presidential guard ( creating the forsidir , see below ) , libya sent him *num* additional soldiers for his own personal safety .
when former president kolingba attempted a coup d'état in *num* ( which was , according to patassé , supported by france ) , the movement for the liberation of congo ( mlc ) of jean-pierre bemba in dr congo came to his rescue .
crimes conducted by patassé's militias and congolese soldiers during this period are now being investigated by the international criminal court , who wrote that " sexual violence appears to have been a central feature of the conflict " , having identified more than *num* rape victims .
the faca has been dominated by soldiers from the yakoma ethnic group since the time of kolingba .
it has hence been considered disloyal by the two northerner presidents patassé and bozizé , both of whom have equipped and run their own militias outside faca .
the military also proved its disloyalty during the mutinies in 1996–1997 .
although francois bozizé had a background in faca himself ( being its chief-of-staff from *num* to *num* ) , he was cautious by retaining the defence portfolio , as well as by appointing his son jean-francis bozizé cabinet director in charge of running the ministry of defence .
he kept his old friend general antoine gambi as chief of staff .
due to failure to curb deepening unrest in the northern part of the country , gambi was in july *num* replaced with bozizé's old friend from the military academy , jules bernard ouandé .
the forces assisting bozizé in seizing the power in *num* were not paid what they were promised and started looting , terrorising and killing ordinary citizens .
summary executions took place with the implicit approval of the government .
the situation has deteriorated since early *num* , and the regular army and the presidential guard regularly execute extortion , torture , killings and other human rights violations .
there is no possibility for the national judicial system to investigate these cases .
at the end of *num* , there were an estimated *num* , *num* internally displaced people in car .
during a un mission in the northern part of the country in november *num* , the mission had a meeting with a prefect who said that he could not maintain law and order over the military and the presidential guards .
the faca currently conducts summary executions and burns houses .
on the route between kaga-bandoro and ouandago some *num* , *num* houses have been burnt , leaving an estimated *num* , *num* persons homeless .
both the " multinational force in the central african republic " ( fomuc ) and france are assisting in the current reform of the army .
one of the key priorities of the reform of the military is make it more ethnically diversified .
it should also integrate bozizé's own rebel group ( mainly consisting of members of his own gbaya tribe ) .
many of the yakoma soldiers who left the country after the mutinies in 1996–1997 have now returned and must also be reintegrated into the army .
at the same time , bonuca holds seminars in topics such as the relationship between military and civil parts of society .
most of the army's heavy weapons and equipment were destroyed or captured by séléka militants during the 2012–2014 civil war .
in the immediate aftermath of the war , the army was only in possession of *num* rifles .
the majority of its arsenals were plundered during the fighting by the séléka coalition and other armed groups .
thousands of the army's small arms were also distributed to civilian supporters of former president bozizé in *num* .
prior to *num* , the army's stocks of arms and ammunition were primarily of french , soviet , and chinese origin .
in *num* , the army's equipment stockpiles were partly revitalized by a donation of *num* pistols , *num* , *num* rifles , and *num* unspecified rocket launchers from russia .
since the mutinies , a number of peacekeeping and peace enforcing international missions have been present in central african republic .
there has been discussion of the deployment of a regional united nations ( un ) peacekeeping force in both chad and central african republic , in order to potentially shore up the ineffectual darfur peace agreement .
the missions deployed in the country during the last *num* years are the following : in addition to the multilateral forces , car has received bilateral support from other african countries , such as the libyan and congolese assistance to patassé mentioned above .
bozizé is in many ways dependent on chad's support .
chad has an interest in car , since it needs to ensure calmness close to its oil fields and the pipeline leading to the cameroonian coast , close to car's troubled northwest .
before seizing power , bozizé built up his rebel force in chad , trained and augmented by the chadian military .
chadian president déby assisted him actively in taking the power in march *num* ( his rebel forces included *num* chadian soldiers ) .
after the coup , chad provided another *num* soldiers .
current direct support includes *num* non-fomuc chadian troops that patrol the border area near goré , a contingent of soldiers in bangui , and troops within the presidential lifeguard .
the cemac force includes *num* chadian soldiers .
there has been an almost uninterrupted french military presence in central african republic since independence , regulated through agreements between the two governments .
french troops were allowed to be based in the country and to intervene in cases of destabilisation .
this was particularly important during the cold war era , when francophone africa was regarded as a natural french sphere of influence .
additionally , the strategic location of the country made it a more interesting location for military bases than its neighbours , and bouar and bangui were hence two of the most important french bases abroad .
however , in *num* , following lionel jospin's expression " neither interference nor indifference " , france came to adopt new strategic principles for its presence in africa .
this included a reduced permanent presence on the continent and increased support for multilateral interventions .
in central african republic , the bouar base and the béal camp ( at that time home to *num* , *num* french soldiers ) in bangui were shut down , as the french concentrated its african presence to abidjan , dakar , djibouti , libreville and n'djamena and the deployment of a " force d'action rapide " , based in france .
however , due to the situation in the country , france has retained a military presence .
during the mutinies , *num* , *num* french soldiers patrolled the streets of bangui .
their official task was to evacuate foreign citizens , but this did not prevent direct confrontations with the mutineers ( resulting in french and mutineer casualties ) .
the level of french involvement resulted in protests among the central african population , since many sided with the mutineers and accused france of defending a dictator against the people's will .
criticism was also heard in france , where some blamed their country for its protection of a discredited ruler , totally incapable of exerting power and managing the country .
after the mutinies in *num* , the misab became a multilateral force , but it was armed , equipped , trained and managed by france .
the chadian , gabonese and congolese troops of the current " force multinationale en centrafrique ( fomuc ) " mission in the country also enjoy logistical support from french soldiers .
a study carried out by the us congressional research service revealed that france has again increased its arms sales to africa , and that during the 1998–2005 period it was the leading supplier of arms to the continent .
the air force is almost inoperable .
lack of funding has almost grounded the air force apart from an as *num* ecureuil delivered in *num* .
mirage f1 planes from the french air force regularly patrolled troubled regions of the country and also participated in direct confrontations until they were withdrawn and retired in *num* .
according to some sources , bozizé used the money he got from the mining concession in bakouma to buy two old mi *num* helicopters from ukraine and one lockheed c-130 hercules , built in the 1950s , from the usa .
the air force otherwise operates *num* light aircraft , including a single helicopter : the presidential guard ( " garde présidentielle " ) or republican guard is officially part of faca but it is often regarded as a separate entity under the direct command of the president .
since *num* the guard has received training from south africa and sudan , with belgium and germany providing support .
gr consists of so-called patriots that fought for bozizé when he seized power in *num* ( mainly from the gbaya tribe ) , together with soldiers from chad .
they are guilty of numerous assaults on the civil population , such as terror , aggression , sexual violence .
only a couple of months after bozizé's seizure of power , in may *num* , taxi and truck drivers conducted a strike against these outrages .
however , post-civil leaders have been cautious in attempting to significantly reform the republican guard .
bozizé has created an amphibious force .
it is called the second battalion of the ground forces and it patrols the ubangi river .
the staff of the sixth region in bouali ( mainly made up of members of the former president's lifeguard ) was transferred to the city of mongoumba , located on the river .
this city had previously been plundered by forces from the mlc , that had crossed the car / congo border .
the riverine patrol force has approximately one hundred personnel and operates seven patrol boats .
a program for disarmament and reintegration of veteran soldiers is currently taking place .
a national commission for the disarmament , demobilisation and reintegration was put in place in september *num* .
the commission is in charge of implementing a program wherein approximately *num* , *num* veteran soldiers will be reintegrated in civil life and obtain education .
christopher alexander christopher wolfgang alexander ( born *num* october *num* in vienna , austria ) is a widely influential architect and design theorist , and currently emeritus professor at the university of california , berkeley .
his theories about the nature of human-centered design have affected fields beyond architecture , including urban design , software , sociology and others .
alexander has designed and personally built over *num* buildings , both as an architect and a general contractor .
in software , alexander is regarded as the father of the pattern language movement .
the first wiki—the technology behind wikipedia—led directly from alexander's work , according to its creator , ward cunningham .
alexander's work has also influenced the development of agile software development .
in architecture , alexander's work is used by a number of different contemporary architectural communities of practice , including the new urbanist movement , to help people to reclaim control over their own built environment .
however , alexander is controversial among some mainstream architects and critics , in part because his work is often harshly critical of much of contemporary architectural theory and practice .
alexander is known for many books on the design and building process , including " notes on the synthesis of form , a city is not a tree " ( first published as a paper and recently re-published in book form ) , " the timeless way of building , a new theory of urban design , " and " the oregon experiment .
" more recently he published the four-volume " the nature of order : an essay on the art of building and the nature of the universe , " about his newer theories of " morphogenetic " processes , and " the battle for the life and beauty of the earth " , about the implementation of his theories in a large building project in japan .
all his works are developed or accumulated from his previous works , so his works should be read as a whole rather than fragmented pieces .
his life's work or the best of his works is the nature of order on which he spent about *num* years , and the very first version of the nature of order was done in *num* , one year before this famous debate with peter eisenman in harvard .
alexander is perhaps best known for his *num* book " a pattern language , " a perennial seller some four decades after publication .
reasoning that users are more sensitive to their needs than any architect could be , he produced and validated ( in collaboration with his students sara ishikawa , murray silverstein , max jacobson , ingrid king , and shlomo angel ) a " pattern language " to empower anyone to design and build at any scale .
as a young child alexander emigrated in fall *num* with his parents from austria to england , when his parents were forced to flee the nazi regime .
he spent much of his childhood in chichester and oxford , england , where he began his education in the sciences .
he moved from england to the united states in *num* to study at harvard university and massachusetts institute of technology .
he moved to berkeley , california in *num* to accept an appointment as professor of architecture , a position he would hold for almost *num* years .
in *num* , after his retirement , alexander moved to arundel , england , where he continues to write , teach and build .
alexander is married to margaret moore alexander , and he has two daughters , sophie and lily , by his former wife pamela .
alexander attended oundle school , england .
in *num* , he was awarded the top open scholarship to trinity college , cambridge university in chemistry and physics , and went on to read mathematics .
he earned a bachelor's degree in architecture and a master's degree in mathematics .
he took his doctorate at harvard ( the first ph .
d .
in architecture ever awarded at harvard university ) , and was elected fellow at harvard .
during the same period he worked at mit in transportation theory and computer science , and worked at harvard in cognition and cognitive studies .
alexander was elected to the society of fellows , harvard university 1961-64 ; awarded the first medal for research by the american institute of architects , *num* ; elected member of the swedish royal academy , *num* ; winner of the best building in japan award , *num* ; winner of the acsa ( association of collegiate schools of architecture ) distinguished professor award , *num* and *num* ; invited to present the louis kahn memorial lecture , *num* ; awarded the seaside prize , *num* ; elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences , *num* ; one of the two inaugural recipients of the athena award , given by the congress for the new urbanism ( cnu ) , *num* ; .
awarded ( " in absentia " ) the vincent scully prize by the national building museum , *num* ; awarded the lifetime achievement award by the urban design group , *num* ; winner of the global award for sustainable architecture , *num* .
"the timeless way of building " ( *num* ) described the perfection of use to which buildings could aspire : "a pattern language : towns , buildings , construction " ( *num* ) described a practical architectural system in a form that a theoretical mathematician or computer scientist might call a generative grammar .
the work originated from an observation that many medieval cities are attractive and harmonious .
the authors said that this occurs because they were built to local regulations that required specific features , but freed the architect to adapt them to particular situations .
the book provides rules and pictures , and leaves decisions to be taken from the precise environment of the project .
it describes exact methods for constructing practical , safe and attractive designs at every scale , from entire regions , through cities , neighborhoods , gardens , buildings , rooms , built-in furniture , and fixtures down to the level of doorknobs .
a notable value is that the architectural system consists only of classic patterns tested in the real world and reviewed by multiple architects for beauty and practicality .
the book includes all needed surveying and structural calculations , and a novel simplified building system that copes with regional shortages of wood and steel , uses easily stored inexpensive materials , and produces long-lasting classic buildings with small amounts of materials , design and labor .
it first has users prototype a structure on-site in temporary materials .
once accepted , these are finished by filling them with very-low-density concrete .
it uses vaulted construction to build as high as three stories , permitting very high densities .
this book's method was adopted by the university of oregon , as described in " the oregon experiment " ( *num* ) , and remains the official planning instrument .
it has also been adopted in part by some cities as a building code .
the idea of a pattern language appears to apply to any complex engineering task , and has been applied to some of them .
it has been especially influential in software engineering where patterns have been used to document collective knowledge in the field .
"a new theory of urban design " ( *num* ) coincided with a renewal of interest in urbanism among architects , but stood apart from most other expressions of this by assuming a distinctly anti-masterplanning stance .
an account of a design studio conducted with berkeley students on a site in san francisco , it shows how convincing urban networks can be generated by requiring individual actors to respect only " local " rules , in relation to neighbours .
a vastly undervalued part of the alexander canon , " a new theory " is important in understanding the generative processes which give rise to the shanty towns latterly championed by stewart brand , robert neuwirth , and the prince of wales .
there have been critical reconstructions of alexander's design studio based on the theories put forward in " a new theory of urban design " .
"the nature of order : an essay on the art of building and the nature of the universe " ( 2003–04 ) , which includes the " phenomenon of life " , " the process of creating life " , " a vision of a living world " and " the luminous ground " , is alexander's most comprehensive and elaborate work .
in it , he puts forth a new theory about the nature of space and describes how this theory influences thinking about architecture , building , planning , and the way in which we view the world in general .
the mostly static patterns from " a pattern language " have been amended by more dynamic sequences , which describe how to work towards patterns ( which can roughly be seen as the end result of sequences ) .
sequences , like patterns , promise to be tools of wider scope than building ( just as his theory of space goes beyond architecture ) .
the online publication " katarxis *num* " ( september *num* ) includes several essays by christopher alexander , as well as the legendary debate between alexander and peter eisenman from *num* .
alexander's latest book , " the battle for the life and beauty of the earth : a struggle between two world-systems " ( *num* ) , is the story of the largest project he and his colleagues had ever tackled , the construction of a new high school / college campus in japan .
he also uses the project to connect with themes in his four-volume series .
he contrasts his approach , ( system a ) with the construction processes endemic in the us and japanese economies ( system b ) .
as alexander describes it , system a is focused on enhancing the life / spirit of spaces within given constraints ( land , budget , client needs , etc .
) ( drawings are sketches - decisions on placing buildings , materials used , finish and such are made in the field as construction proceeds , with adjustments as needed to meet overall budget ) ; system b ignores , and tends to diminish or destroy that quality ( architect responsible for drawings which the builder uses to build structures at the lowest possible cost ) .
in the last few chapters he describes " centers " as a way of thinking about the connections among spaces , and about what brings more wholeness and life to a space .
among alexander's most notable built works are the eishin campus near tokyo ( the building process of which is outlined in his *num* book " the battle for the life and beauty of the earth " ) ; the west dean visitors centre in west sussex , england ; the julian street inn ( a homeless shelter ) in san jose , california ( both described in " nature of order " ) ; the sala house and the martinez house ( experimental houses in albany and martinez , california made of lightweight concrete ) ; the low-cost housing in mexicali , mexico ( described in " the production of houses " ) ; and several private houses ( described and illustrated in " the nature of order " ) .
alexander's built work is characterized by a special quality ( which he used to call " the quality without a name " , but named " wholeness " in " nature of order " ) that relates to human beings and induces feelings of belonging to the place and structure .
this quality is found in the most loved traditional and historic buildings and urban spaces , and is precisely what alexander has tried to capture with his sophisticated mathematical design theories .
paradoxically , achieving this connective human quality has also moved his buildings away from the abstract imageability valued in contemporary architecture , and this is one reason why his buildings are under-appreciated at present .
his former student and colleague michael mehaffy wrote an introductory essay on alexander's built work in the online publication " katarxis *num* " , which includes a gallery of alexander's major built projects through september *num* .
in addition to his lengthy teaching career as a professor at uc berkeley ( during which a number of international students began to appreciate and apply his methods ) , alexander was a key faculty member at both the prince of wales's summer schools in civil architecture ( 1990–1994 ) and the prince's foundation for the built environment .
he also initiated the process which led to the international building beauty post-graduate school for architecture , which launched in sorrento , italy for the 2017-18 academic year .
alexander's work has widely influenced architects ; among those who acknowledge his influence are sarah susanka , andres duany , and witold rybczynski .
robert campbell , the pulitzer prize-winning architecture critic for the " boston globe " , stated that alexander " has had an enormous critical influence on my life and work , and i think that's true of a whole generation of people .
" architecture critic peter buchanan , in an essay for " the architectural review"s *num* campaign " the big rethink " , argues that alexander's work as reflected in " a pattern language " is " thoroughly subversive and forward looking rather than regressive , as so many misunderstand it to be .
" he continues : many urban development projects continue to incorporate alexander's ideas .
for example , in the uk the developers living villages have been highly influenced by alexander's work and used " a pattern language " as the basis for the design of the wintles in bishops castle , shropshire .
sarah susanka's " not so big house " movement adapts and popularizes alexander's patterns and outlook .
alexander's " notes on the synthesis of form " was said to be required reading for researchers in computer science throughout the 1960s .
it had an influence in the 1960s and 1970s on programming language design , modular programming , object-oriented programming , software engineering and other design methodologies .
alexander's mathematical concepts and orientation were similar to edsger dijkstra's influential " a discipline of programming " .
the greatest influence of " a pattern language " in computer science is the design patterns movement .
alexander's philosophy of incremental , organic , coherent design also influenced the extreme programming movement .
the wiki was invented to allow the hillside group to work on programming design patterns .
more recently the " deep geometrical structures " as discussed in " the nature of order " have been cited as having importance for object-oriented programming , particularly in c++ .
will wright wrote that alexander's work was influential in the origin of the " simcity " computer games , and in his later game " spore " .
alexander has often led his own software research , such as the *num* gatemaker project with greg bryant .
alexander discovered and conceived a recursive structure , so called wholeness , which is defined mathematically , exists in space and matter physically , and reflects in our minds and cognition psychologically .
he had his idea of wholeness back to early 1980s when he finished his very first version of " the nature of order " .
in fact , his idea of wholeness or degree of wholeness relying a recursive structure of centers resemble in spirit to google's pagerank .
the fourth volume of " the nature of order " approaches religious questions from a scientific and philosophical rather than mystical direction .
in it , alexander describes deep ties between the nature of matter , human perception of the universe , and the geometries people construct in buildings , cities , and artifacts .
he suggests a crucial link between traditional practices and beliefs , and recent scientific advances .
despite his leanings toward deism , and his naturalistic and anthropological approach to religion , alexander maintains that he is a practicing member of the catholic church , believing it to embody a great deal of accumulated human truth within its rituals .
the life's work of alexander is dedicated to turn design from unselfconscious behavior to selfconscious behavior , so called design science .
in his very first book " notes on the synthesis of forms " , he has set what he wanted to do .
he was inspired by traditional buildings , and tried to derive some *num* patterns for architectural design .
later on , he further distills *num* geometric properties to characterize living structure in " the nature of order " .
the design principles are differentiation and adaptation .
in his classic " a city is not a tree " , he already had some primary ideas of complex networks , although he used semilattice rather than complex networks .
in his first book " notes on the synthesis of forms " on page *num* , he illustrated something that is in fact community or community structure in complex networks , a recent topic emerged around *num* : community structure .
andes the andes or andean mountains ( ) are the longest continental mountain range in the world , forming a continuous highland along the western edge of south america .
this range is about long , about wide ( widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude ) , and of an average height of about .
the andes extend from north to south through seven south american countries : venezuela , colombia , ecuador , peru , bolivia , chile and argentina .
along their length , the andes are split into several ranges , separated by intermediate depressions .
the andes are the location of several high plateaus – some of which host major cities such as quito , bogotá , arequipa , medellín , sucre , mérida and la paz .
the altiplano plateau is the world's second-highest after the tibetan plateau .
these ranges are in turn grouped into three major divisions based on climate : the tropical andes , the dry andes , and the wet andes .
the andes mountains are the world's highest mountain range outside asia .
the highest mountain outside asia , argentina's mount aconcagua , rises to an elevation of about above sea level .
the peak of chimborazo in the ecuadorian andes is farther from the earth's center than any other location on the earth's surface , due to the equatorial bulge resulting from the earth's rotation .
the world's highest volcanoes are in the andes , including ojos del salado on the chile-argentina border , which rises to .
the andes are also part of the american cordillera , a chain of mountain ranges ( cordillera ) that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western " backbone " of north america , central america , south america and antarctica .
the etymology of the word " andes " has been debated .
the majority consensus is that it derives from the quechua word , which means " east " as in " antisuyu " ( quechua for " east region " ) , one of the four regions of the inca empire .
the andes can be divided into three sections : in the northern part of the andes , the isolated sierra nevada de santa marta range is often considered to be part of the andes .
the term " cordillera " comes from the spanish word " cordel " , meaning " rope " .
the andes range is about wide throughout its length , except in the bolivian flexure where it is about wide .
the leeward antilles islands aruba , bonaire , and curaçao , which lie in the caribbean sea off the coast of venezuela , were thought to represent the submerged peaks of the extreme northern edge of the andes range , but ongoing geological studies indicate that such a simplification does not do justice to the complex tectonic boundary between the south american and caribbean plates .
the andes are a mesozoic–tertiary orogenic belt of mountains along the pacific ring of fire , a zone of volcanic activity that encompasses the pacific rim of the americas as well as the asia-pacific region .
the andes are the result of tectonic plate processes , caused by the subduction of oceanic crust beneath the south american plate .
it is the result of a convergent plate boundary between the nazca plate and the south american plate the main cause of the rise of the andes is the compression of the western rim of the south american plate due to the subduction of the nazca plate and the antarctic plate .
to the east , the andes range is bounded by several sedimentary basins , such as orinoco , amazon basin , madre de dios and gran chaco , that separate the andes from the ancient cratons in eastern south america .
in the south , the andes share a long boundary with the former patagonia terrane .
to the west , the andes end at the pacific ocean , although the peru-chile trench can be considered their ultimate western limit .
from a geographical approach , the andes are considered to have their western boundaries marked by the appearance of coastal lowlands and a less rugged topography .
the andes mountains also contain large quantities of iron ore located in many mountains within the range .
the andean orogen has a series of bends or oroclines .
the bolivian orocline is a seaward concave bending in the coast of south america and the andes mountains at about 18° s .
at this point , the orientation of the andes turns from northwest in peru to south in chile and argentina .
the andean segment north and south of the orocline have been rotated 15° to 20° counter clockwise and clockwise respectively .
the bolivian orocline area overlaps with the area of maximum width of the altiplano plateau and according to isacks ( *num* ) the orocline is related to crustal shortening .
the specific point at 18° s where the coastline bends is known as the " arica elbow " .
further south lies the maipo orocline or maipo transition zone located between 30° s and 38°s with a break in trend at 33° s .
near the southern tip of the andes lies the patagonian orocline .
the western rim of the south american plate has been the place of several pre-andean orogenies since at least the late proterozoic and early paleozoic , when several terranes and microcontinents collided and amalgamated with the ancient cratons of eastern south america , by then the south american part of gondwana .
the formation of the modern andes began with the events of the triassic when pangaea began the break up that resulted in developing several rifts .
the development continued through the jurassic period .
it was during the cretaceous period that the andes began to take their present form , by the uplifting , faulting and folding of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks of the ancient cratons to the east .
the rise of the andes has not been constant , as different regions have had different degrees of tectonic stress , uplift , and erosion .
tectonic forces above the subduction zone along the entire west coast of south america where the nazca plate and a part of the antarctic plate are sliding beneath the south american plate continue to produce an ongoing orogenic event resulting in minor to major earthquakes and volcanic eruptions to this day .
in the extreme south , a major transform fault separates tierra del fuego from the small scotia plate .
across the wide drake passage lie the mountains of the antarctic peninsula south of the scotia plate which appear to be a continuation of the andes chain .
the regions immediately east of the andes experience a series of changes resulting from the andean orogeny .
parts of the sunsás orogen in amazonian craton disappeared from the surface of earth being overridden by the andes .
the sierras de córdoba , where the effects of the ancient pampean orogeny can be observed , owe their modern uplift and relief to the andean orogeny in the tertiary .
further south in southern patagonia the onset of the andean orogeny caused the magallanes basin to evolve from being an extensional back-arc basin in the mesozoic to being a compressional foreland basin in the cenozoic .
the andes range has many active volcanoes distributed in four volcanic zones separated by areas of inactivity .
the andean volcanism is a result of subduction of the nazca plate and antarctic plate underneath the south american plate .
the belt is subdivided into four main volcanic zones that are separated from each other by volcanic gaps .
the volcanoes of the belt are diverse in terms of activity style , products and morphology .
while some differences can be explained by which volcanic zone a volcano belongs to , there are significant differences inside volcanic zones and even between neighbouring volcanoes .
despite being a type location for calc-alkalic and subduction volcanism , the andean volcanic belt has a large range of volcano-tectonic settings , such as rift systems and extensional zones , transpressional faults , subduction of mid-ocean ridges and seamount chains apart from a large range of crustal thicknesses and magma ascent paths , and different amount of crustal assimilations .
the andes mountains host large ore and salt deposits and some of their eastern fold and thrust belt acts as traps for commercially exploitable amounts of hydrocarbons .
in the forelands of the atacama desert some of the largest porphyry copper mineralizations occurs making chile and peru the first and second largest exporters of copper in the world .
porphyry copper in the western slopes of the andes has been generated by hydrothermal fluids ( mostly water ) during the cooling of plutons or volcanic systems .
the porphyry mineralization further benefited from the dry climate that let them largely out of the disturbing actions of meteoric water .
the dry climate in the central western andes has also led to the creation of extensive saltpeter deposits which were extensively mined until the invention of synthetic nitrates .
yet another result of the dry climate are the salars of atacama and uyuni , the first one being the largest source of lithium today and the second the world's largest reserve of the element .
early mesozoic and neogene plutonism in bolivia's cordillera central created the bolivian tin belt as well as the famous , now depleted , deposits of cerro rico de potosí .
the climate in the andes varies greatly depending on latitude , altitude , and proximity to the sea .
temperature , atmospheric pressure and humidity decrease in higher elevations .
the southern section is rainy and cool , the central section is dry .
the northern andes are typically rainy and warm , with an average temperature of in colombia .
the climate is known to change drastically in rather short distances .
rainforests exist just miles away from the snow-covered peak cotopaxi .
the mountains have a large effect on the temperatures of nearby areas .
the snow line depends on the location .
it is at between in the tropical ecuadorian , colombian , venezuelan , and northern peruvian andes , rising to in the drier mountains of southern peru south to northern chile south to about 30°s , then descending to on aconcagua at 32°s , at 40°s , at 50°s , and only in tierra del fuego at 55°s ; from 50°s , several of the larger glaciers descend to sea level .
the andes of chile and argentina can be divided in two climatic and glaciological zones : the dry andes and the wet andes .
since the dry andes extend from the latitudes of atacama desert to the area of maule river , precipitation is more sporadic and there are strong temperature oscillations .
the line of equilibrium may shift drastically over short periods of time , leaving a whole glacier in the ablation area or in the accumulation area .
in the high andes of central chile and mendoza province , rock glaciers are larger and more common than glaciers ; this is due to the high exposure to solar radiation .
though precipitation increases with the height , there are semiarid conditions in the nearly highest mountains of the andes .
this dry steppe climate is considered to be typical of the subtropical position at 32–34° s .
the valley bottoms have no woods , just dwarf scrub .
the largest glaciers , as e .
g .
the plomo glacier and the horcones glaciers , do not even reach in length and have an only insignificant ice thickness .
at glacial times , however , c .
*num* , *num* years ago , the glaciers were over ten times longer .
on the east side of this section of the mendozina andes , they flowed down to and on the west side to about above sea level .
the massifs of cerro aconcagua ( ) , cerro tupungato ( ) and nevado juncal ( ) are tens of kilometres away from each other and were connected by a joint ice stream network .
the andes ' dendritic glacier arms , i .
e .
components of valley glaciers , were up to long , over thick and overspanned a vertical distance of .
the climatic glacier snowline ( ela ) was lowered from to at glacial times .
the andean region cuts across several natural and floristic regions due to its extension from caribbean venezuela to cold , windy and wet cape horn passing through the hyperarid atacama desert .
rainforests and tropical dry forests used to encircle much of the northern andes but are now greatly diminished , especially in the chocó and inter-andean valleys of colombia .
opposite of the humid andean slopes are the relatively dry andean slopes in most of western peru , chile and argentina .
along with several interandean valles , they are typically dominated by deciduous woodland , shrub and xeric vegetation , reaching the extreme in the slopes near the virtually lifeless atacama desert .
about *num* , *num* species of vascular plants live in the andes , with roughly half being endemic to the region , surpassing the diversity of any other hotspot .
the small tree " cinchona pubescens " , a source of quinine which is used to treat malaria , is found widely in the andes as far south as bolivia .
other important crops that originated from the andes are tobacco and potatoes .
the high-altitude " polylepis " forests and woodlands are found in the andean areas of colombia , ecuador , peru , bolivia and chile .
these trees , by locals referred to as queñua , yagual and other names , can be found at altitudes of above sea level .
it remains unclear if the patchy distribution of these forests and woodlands is natural , or the result of clearing which began during the incan period .
regardless , in modern times the clearance has accelerated , and the trees are now considered to be highly endangered , with some believing that as little as *num* % of the original woodland remains .
the andes are rich in fauna : with almost *num* , *num* species , of which roughly *num* / *num* are endemic to the region , the andes are the most important region in the world for amphibians .
the diversity of animals in the andes is high , with almost *num* species of mammals ( *num* % endemic ) , more than *num* , *num* species of birds ( about *num* / *num* endemic ) , more than *num* species of reptile ( about *num* % endemic ) , and almost *num* species of fish ( about *num* / *num* endemic ) .
the vicuña and guanaco can be found living in the altiplano , while the closely related domesticated llama and alpaca are widely kept by locals as pack animals and for their meat and wool .
the crepuscular ( active during dawn and dusk ) chinchillas , two threatened members of the rodent order , inhabit the andes ' alpine regions .
the andean condor , the largest bird of its kind in the western hemisphere , occurs throughout much of the andes but generally in very low densities .
other animals found in the relatively open habitats of the high andes include the huemul , cougar , foxes in the genus " pseudalopex " , and , for birds , certain species of tinamous ( notably members of the genus " nothoprocta " ) , andean goose , giant coot , flamingos ( mainly associated with hypersaline lakes ) , lesser rhea , andean flicker , diademed sandpiper-plover , miners , sierra-finches and diuca-finches .
lake titicaca hosts several endemics , among them the highly endangered titicaca flightless grebe and titicaca water frog .
a few species of hummingbirds , notably some hillstars , can be seen at altitudes above , but far higher diversities can be found at lower altitudes , especially in the humid andean forests ( " cloud forests " ) growing on slopes in colombia , ecuador , peru , bolivia and far northwestern argentina .
these forest-types , which includes the yungas and parts of the chocó , are very rich in flora and fauna , although few large mammals exist , exceptions being the threatened mountain tapir , spectacled bear and yellow-tailed woolly monkey .
birds of humid andean forests include mountain-toucans , quetzals and the andean cock-of-the-rock , while mixed species flocks dominated by tanagers and furnariids commonly are seen – in contrast to several vocal but typically cryptic species of wrens , tapaculos and antpittas .
a number of species such as the royal cinclodes and white-browed tit-spinetail are associated with " polylepis " , and consequently also threatened .
the andes mountains form a north-south axis of cultural influences .
a long series of cultural development culminated in the expansion of the inca civilization and inca empire in the central andes during the *ord* century .
the incas formed this civilization through imperialistic militarism as well as careful and meticulous governmental management .
the government sponsored the construction of aqueducts and roads in addition to preexisting installations .
some of these constructions are still in existence today .
devastated by european diseases to which they had no immunity and civil wars , in *num* the incas were defeated by an alliance composed of tens of thousands of allies from nations they had subjugated ( e .
g .
huancas , chachapoyas , cañaris ) and a small army of *num* spaniards led by francisco pizarro .
one of the few inca sites the spanish never found in their conquest was machu picchu , which lay hidden on a peak on the eastern edge of the andes where they descend to the amazon .
the main surviving languages of the andean peoples are those of the quechua and aymara language families .
woodbine parish and joseph barclay pentland surveyed a large part of the bolivian andes from *num* to *num* .
in modern times , the largest cities in the andes are bogotá , colombia , with a population of about eight million , santiago , chile , and medellin , colombia .
lima is a coastal city adjacent to the andes and is the largest city of all andean countries .
it is the seat of the andean community of nations .
la paz , bolivia's seat of government , is the highest capital city in the world , at an elevation of approximately .
parts of the la paz conurbation , including the city of el alto , extend up to .
other cities in or near the andes include arequipa , cusco , huancayo , cajamarca , juliaca , huánuco , huaraz , and puno in peru ; quito , cuenca , ambato , loja , riobamba , and ibarra in ecuador ; cochabamba , oruro , sucre , and tarija in bolivia ; calama and rancagua in chile ; cali , cúcuta , bucaramanga , ibagué , pereira , pasto , palmira , popayán , tunja , villavicencio , and manizales in colombia ; and barquisimeto , san cristóbal , mérida , and valera in venezuela and mendoza , tucumán , salta , and san juan in argentina .
the cities of caracas , valencia , and maracay are in the venezuelan coastal range , which is a debatable extension of the andes at the northern extreme of south america .
cities and large towns are connected with asphalt-paved roads , while smaller towns are often connected by dirt roads , which may require a four-wheel-drive vehicle .
the rough terrain has historically put the costs of building highways and railroads that cross the andes out of reach of most neighboring countries , even with modern civil engineering practices .
for example , the main crossover of the andes between argentina and chile is still accomplished through the paso internacional los libertadores .
only recently the ends of some highways that came rather close to one another from the east and the west have been connected .
much of the transportation of passengers is done via aircraft .
however , there is one railroad that connects chile with peru via the andes , and there are others that make the same connection via southern bolivia .
see railroad maps of that region .
there are multiple highways in bolivia that cross the andes .
some of these were built during a period of war between bolivia and paraguay , in order to transport bolivian troops and their supplies to the war front in the lowlands of southeastern bolivia and western paraguay .
for decades , chile claimed ownership of land on the eastern side of the andes .
however , these claims were given up in about *num* during the war of the pacific between chile , the allied bolivia and peru , in a diplomatic deal to keep peru out of the war .
the chilean army and chilean navy defeated the combined forces of bolivia and peru , and chile took over bolivia's only province on the pacific coast , some land from peru that was returned to peru decades later .
bolivia has been a completely landlocked country ever since .
it mostly uses seaports in eastern argentina and uruguay for international trade because its diplomatic relations with chile have been suspended since *num* .
because of the tortuous terrain in places , villages and towns in the mountains—to which travel via motorized vehicles is of little use—are still located in the high andes of chile , bolivia , peru , and ecuador .
locally , the relatives of the camel , the llama , and the alpaca continue to carry out important uses as pack animals , but this use has generally diminished in modern times .
donkeys , mules , and horses are also useful .
the ancient peoples of the andes such as the incas have practiced irrigation techniques for over *num* , *num* years .
because of the mountain slopes , terracing has been a common practice .
terracing , however , was only extensively employed after incan imperial expansions to fuel their expanding realm .
the potato holds a very important role as an internally consumed staple crop .
maize was also an important crop for these people , and was used for the production of chicha , important to andean native people .
currently , tobacco , cotton and coffee are the main export crops .
coca , despite eradication programmes in some countries , remains an important crop for legal local use in a mildly stimulating herbal tea , and , both controversially and illegally , for the production of cocaine .
in unirrigated land , pasture is the most common type of land use .
in the rainy season ( summer ) , part of the rangeland is used for cropping ( mainly potatoes , barley , broad beans and wheat ) .
irrigation is helpful in advancing the sowing data of the summer crops which guarantees an early yield in the period of food shortage .
also , by early sowing , maize can be cultivated higher up in the mountains ( up to ) .
in addition it makes cropping in the dry season ( winter ) possible and allows the cultivation of frost resistant vegetable crops like onion and carrot .
the andes rose to fame for their mineral wealth during the spanish conquest of south america .
although andean amerindian peoples crafted ceremonial jewelry of gold and other metals , the mineralizations of the andes were first mined in large scale after the spanish arrival .
potosí in present-day bolivia and cerro de pasco in peru were one of the principal mines of the spanish empire in the new world .
río de la plata and argentina derive their names from the silver of potosí .
currently , mining in the andes of chile and peru places these countries as the first and third major producers of copper in the world .
peru also contains the *ord* largest goldmine in the world : the yanacocha .
the bolivian andes produce principally tin although historically silver mining had a huge impact on the economy of *ord* century europe .
there is a long history of mining in the andes , from the spanish silver mines in potosí in the *ord* century to the vast current porphyry copper deposits of chuquicamata and escondida in chile and toquepala in peru .
other metals including iron , gold and tin in addition to non-metallic resources are important .
this list contains some of the major peaks in the andes mountain range .
the highest peak is aconcagua of argentina ( see below ) .
counterpoint in music , counterpoint is the relationship between voices that are harmonically interdependent ( polyphony ) yet independent in rhythm and contour .
it has been most commonly identified in the european classical tradition , strongly developing during the renaissance and in much of the common practice period , especially in the baroque .
the term originates from the latin " punctus contra punctum " meaning " point against point " .
counterpoint has been used to designate a voice or even an entire composition .
counterpoint focuses on melodic interaction—only secondarily on the harmonies produced by that interaction .
in the words of john rahn : counterpoint theory has been given a mathematical foundation in the work initiated by guerino mazzola .
in particular , his model gives a structural ( and not psychological ) foundation of forbidden parallels of fifths and the dissonant fourth .
the model has also been extended to microtonal contexts by octavio agustin .
some examples of related compositional techniques include : the round ( familiar in folk traditions ) , the canon , and perhaps the most complex contrapuntal convention : the fugue .
all of these are examples of imitative counterpoint .
species counterpoint was developed as a pedagogical tool in which students progress through several " species " of increasing complexity , with a very simple part that remains constant known as the cantus firmus ( latin for " fixed melody " ) .
species counterpoint generally offers less freedom to the composer than other types of counterpoint and therefore is called a " strict " counterpoint .
the student gradually attains the ability to write " free " counterpoint ( that is , less rigorously constrained counterpoint , usually without a cantus firmus ) according to the given rules at the time .
the idea is at least as old as *num* , when giovanni maria lanfranco described a similar concept in his " scintille di musica " ( brescia , *num* ) .
the 16th-century venetian theorist zarlino elaborated on the idea in his influential " le institutioni harmoniche " , and it was first presented in a codified form in *num* by lodovico zacconi in his " prattica di musica " .
zacconi , unlike later theorists , included a few extra contrapuntal techniques , such as invertible counterpoint .
in *num* johann joseph fux published " gradus ad parnassum " ( steps to parnassus ) , in which he described five species : a succession of later theorists quite closely imitated fux's seminal work , often with some small and idiosyncratic modifications in the rules .
many of fux's rules concerning the purely linear construction of melodies have their origin in solfeggi .
concerning the common practice era , alterations to the melodic rules were introduced to enable the function of certain harmonic forms .
the combination of these melodies produced the basic harmonic structure , the figured bass .
the following rules apply to melodic writing in each species , for each part : and , in all species , the following rules govern the combination of the parts : in " first species " counterpoint , each note in every added part ( parts being also referred to as " lines " or " voices " ) sounds against one note in the cantus firmus .
notes in all parts are sounded simultaneously , and move against each other simultaneously .
since all notes in first species counterpoint are whole notes , rhythmic independence is not available .
in the present context , a " step " is a melodic interval of a half or whole step .
a " skip " is an interval of a third or fourth .
( see steps and skips .
) an interval of a fifth or larger is referred to as a " leap " .
a few further rules given by fux , by study of the palestrina style , and usually given in the works of later counterpoint pedagogues , are as follows .
in the adjacent example in two parts , the cantus firmus is the lower part .
( the same cantus firmus is used for later examples also .
each is in the dorian mode .
) in " second species " counterpoint , two notes in each of the added parts work against each longer note in the given part .
additional considerations in second species counterpoint are as follows , and are in addition to the considerations for first species : in " third species " counterpoint , four ( or three , etc .
) notes move against each longer note in the given part .
three special figures are introduced into third species and later added to fifth species , and ultimately outside the restrictions of " species writing " .
there are three figures to consider : the " nota cambiata " , " double neighbor tones " , and " double passing tones " .
double neighbor tones : the figure is prolonged over four beats and allows special dissonances .
the upper and lower tones are prepared on beat *num* and resolved on beat *num* .
the fifth note or downbeat of the next measure should move by step in the same direction as the last two notes of the double neighbor figure .
lastly a double passing tone allows two dissonant passing tones in a row .
the figure would consist of *num* notes moving in the same direction by step .
the two notes that allow dissonance would be beat *num* and *num* or *num* and *num* .
the dissonant interval of a fourth would proceed into a diminished fifth and the next note would resolve at the interval of a sixth .
in " fourth species " counterpoint , some notes are sustained or " suspended " in an added part while notes move against them in the given part , often creating a dissonance on the beat , followed by the suspended note then changing ( and " catching up " ) to create a subsequent consonance with the note in the given part as it continues to sound .
as before , fourth species counterpoint is called " expanded " when the added-part notes vary in length among themselves .
the technique requires chains of notes sustained across the boundaries determined by beat , and so creates syncopation .
also it is important to note that a dissonant interval is allowed on beat *num* because of the syncopation created by the suspension .

" » / short example of " florid " counterpoint since the renaissance period in european music , much contrapuntal music has been written in imitative counterpoint .
in imitative counterpoint , two or more voices enter at different times , and ( especially when entering ) each voice repeats some version of the same melodic element .
the fantasia , the ricercar , and later , the canon and fugue ( the contrapuntal form " par excellence " ) all feature imitative counterpoint , which also frequently appears in choral works such as motets and madrigals .
imitative counterpoint spawned a number of devices , including : broadly speaking , due to the development of harmony , from the baroque period on , most contrapuntal compositions were written in the style of free counterpoint .
this means that the general focus of the composer had shifted away from how the intervals of added melodies related to a " cantus firmus " , and more toward how they related to each other .
nonetheless , according to kent kennan : " .
.
.
actual teaching in that fashion ( free counterpoint ) did not become widespread until the late nineteenth century .
" young composers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , such as mozart , beethoven , and schumann , were still educated in the style of " strict " counterpoint , but in practice , they would look for ways to expand on the traditional concepts of the subject .
main features of free counterpoint : linear counterpoint is " a purely horizontal technique in which the integrity of the individual melodic lines is not sacrificed to harmonic considerations .
" its distinctive feature is rather the concept of melody , which served as the starting-point for the adherents of the ' new objectivity ' when they set up linear counterpoint as an anti-type to the romantic harmony .
" the voice parts move freely , irrespective of the effects their combined motions may create .
" in other words , either " the domination of the horizontal ( linear ) aspects over the vertical " is featured or the " harmonic control of lines is rejected .
" associated with neoclassicism , the first work to use the technique is igor stravinsky's " octet " ( *num* ) , inspired by j .
s .
bach and giovanni palestrina .
however , according to knud jeppesen : " bach's and palestrina's points of departure are antipodal .
palestrina starts out from lines and arrives at chords ; bach's music grows out of an ideally harmonic background , against which the voices develop with a bold independence that is often breath-taking .
" according to cunningham , linear harmony is " a frequent approach in the *ord* century .
.
.
[ in which lines ] are combined with almost careless abandon in the hopes that new ' chords ' and ' progressions ' .
.
.
will result .
" it is possible with " any kind of line , diatonic or duodecuple " .
dissonant counterpoint was originally theorized by charles seeger as " at first purely a school-room discipline , " consisting of species counterpoint but with all the traditional rules reversed .
first species counterpoint must be all dissonances , establishing " dissonance , rather than consonance , as the rule , " and consonances are " resolved " through a skip , not step .
he wrote that " the effect of this discipline " was " one of purification " .
other aspects of composition , such as rhythm , could be " dissonated " by applying the same principle ( charles seeger , " on dissonant counterpoint , " " modern music " *num* , no .
*num* ( june–july *num* ) : 25–26 ) .
seeger was not the first to employ dissonant counterpoint , but was the first to theorize and promote it .
other composers who have used dissonant counterpoint , if not in the exact manner prescribed by charles seeger , include ruth crawford-seeger , carl ruggles , henry cowell , henry brant , dane rudhyar , lou harrison , fartein valen , and arnold schoenberg .
ajax the lesser ajax ( " aias " ) was a greek mythological hero , son of oileus , the king of locris .
he was called the " lesser " or " locrian " ajax , to distinguish him from ajax the great , son of telamon .
he was the leader of the locrian contingent during the trojan war .
he is a significant figure in homer's " iliad " and is also mentioned in the " odyssey " , in virgil's " aeneid " and in euripides ' " the trojan women " .
in etruscan legend , he was known as " aivas vilates " .
ajax's mother's name was eriopis .
according to strabo , he was born in naryx in locris , where ovid calls him " narycius heroes " .
according to the " iliad " , he led his locrians in forty ships against troy .
he is described as one of the great heroes among the greeks .
in battle , he wore a linen cuirass ( ) , was brave and intrepid , especially skilled in throwing the spear and , next to achilles , the swiftest of all the greeks .
in the funeral games at the pyre of patroclus , ajax contended with odysseus and antilochus for the prize in the footrace ; but athena , who was hostile towards him and favored odysseus , made him stumble and fall , so that he won only the second prize .
in later traditions , this ajax is called a son of oileus and the nymph rhene and is also mentioned among the suitors of helen .
after the taking of troy , he rushed into the temple of athena , where cassandra had taken refuge , and was embracing the statue of the goddess in supplication .
ajax violently dragged her away to the other captives .
according to some writers , he raped cassandra inside the temple .
odysseus called for ajax's death by stoning for this crime , but ajax saved himself by claiming innocence with an oath to athena , clutching her statue in supplication .
since ajax dragged a supplicant from her temple , athena had cause to be indignant .
according to the " bibliotheca " , no one was aware that ajax had raped cassandra until calchas , the greek seer , warned the greeks that athena was furious at the treatment of her priestess and she would destroy the greek ships if they didn't kill him immediately .
despite this , ajax managed to hide in the altar of a deity where the greeks , fearing divine retribution should they kill him and destroy the altar , allowed him to live .
when the greeks left without killing ajax , despite their sacrifices , athena became so angry that she persuaded zeus to send a storm that sank many of their ships .
as he was returning from troy , athena hit his ship with a thunderbolt and the vessel was wrecked on the whirling rocks ( ) .
but he escaped with some of his men , managing to cling onto a rock through the assistance of poseidon .
he would have been saved in spite of athena , but he then audaciously declared that he would escape the dangers of the sea in defiance of the immortals .
offended by this presumption , poseidon split the rock with his trident and ajax was swallowed up by the sea .
thetis buried him when the corpse washed up on myconos .
other versions depict a different death for ajax , showing him dying when on his voyage home .
in these versions , when ajax came to the capharean rocks on the coast of euboea , his ship was wrecked in a fierce storm , he himself was lifted up in a whirlwind and impaled with a flash of rapid fire from athena in his chest , and his body thrust upon sharp rocks , which afterwards were called the rocks of ajax .
after ajax's death , his spirit dwelt in the island of leuce .
the opuntian locrians worshiped ajax as their national hero , and so great was their faith in him that when they drew up their army in battle , they always left one place open for him , believing that , although invisible to them , he was fighting for and among them .
the story of ajax was frequently made use of by ancient poets and artists , and the hero who appears on some locrian coins with the helmet , shield , and sword is probably this ajax .
other accounts of ajax's death are offered by philostratus and the scholiast on lycophron .
the abduction of cassandra by ajax was frequently represented in greek works of art , such as the chest of cypselus described by pausanias and in extant works .
great lakes the great lakes ( ) , also called the laurentian great lakes and the great lakes of north america , are a series of interconnected freshwater lakes primarily in the upper mid-east region of north america , on the canada–united states border , which connect to the atlantic ocean through the saint lawrence river .
they consist of lakes superior , michigan , huron , erie , and ontario , although hydrologically , there are four lakes , superior , erie , ontario , and michigan-huron .
the connected lakes form the great lakes waterway .
the great lakes are the largest group of freshwater lakes on earth by total area , and second-largest by total volume , containing *num* % of the world's surface fresh water by volume .
the total surface is , and the total volume ( measured at the low water datum ) is , slightly less than the volume of lake baikal ( , 22–23 % of the world's surface fresh water ) .
due to their sea-like characteristics ( rolling waves , sustained winds , strong currents , great depths , and distant horizons ) the five great lakes have also long been referred to as " inland seas " .
lake superior is the second largest lake in the world by area , and the largest freshwater lake by area .
lake michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country .
the great lakes began to form at the end of the last glacial period around *num* , *num* years ago , as retreating ice sheets exposed the basins they had carved into the land which then filled with meltwater .
the lakes have been a major source for transportation , migration , trade , and fishing , serving as a habitat to a large number of aquatic species in a region with much biodiversity .
the surrounding region is called the great lakes region , which includes the great lakes megalopolis .
though the five lakes lie in separate basins , they form a single , naturally interconnected body of fresh water , within the great lakes basin .
they form a chain connecting the east-central interior of north america to the atlantic ocean .
from the interior to the outlet at the saint lawrence river , water flows from superior to huron and michigan , southward to erie , and finally northward to lake ontario .
the lakes drain a large watershed via many rivers , and are studded with approximately *num* , *num* islands .
there are also several thousand smaller lakes , often called " inland lakes , " within the basin .
the surface area of the five primary lakes combined is roughly equal to the size of the united kingdom , while the surface area of the entire basin ( the lakes and the land they drain ) is about the size of the uk and france combined .
lake michigan is the only one of the great lakes that is entirely within the united states ; the others form a water boundary between the united states and canada .
the lakes are divided among the jurisdictions of the canadian province of ontario and the u .
s .
states of michigan , wisconsin , minnesota , illinois , indiana , ohio , pennsylvania , and new york .
both ontario and michigan include in their boundaries portions of four of the lakes : ontario does not border lake michigan , and michigan does not border lake ontario .
new york and wisconsin's jurisdictions extend into two lakes , and each of the remaining states into one of the lakes .
as the surfaces of lakes superior , huron , michigan , and erie are all approximately the same elevation above sea level , while lake ontario is significantly lower , and because the niagara escarpment precludes all natural navigation , the four upper lakes are commonly called the " upper great lakes " .
this designation , however , is not universal .
those living on the shore of lake superior often refer to all the other lakes as " the lower lakes " , because they are farther south .
sailors of bulk freighters transferring cargoes from lake superior and northern lake michigan and lake huron to ports on lake erie or ontario commonly refer to the latter as the lower lakes and lakes michigan , huron , and superior as the upper lakes .
this corresponds to thinking of lakes erie and ontario as " down south " and the others as " up north " .
vessels sailing north on lake michigan are considered " upbound " even though they are sailing toward its effluent current .
lakes huron and michigan are sometimes considered a single lake , called lake michigan–huron , because they are one hydrological body of water connected by the straits of mackinac .
the straits are wide and deep ; the water levels – at – rise and fall together , and the flow between michigan and huron frequently reverses direction .
dispersed throughout the great lakes are approximately *num* , *num* islands .
the largest among them is manitoulin island in lake huron , the largest island in any inland body of water in the world .
the second-largest island is isle royale in lake superior .
both of these islands are large enough to contain multiple lakes themselves—for instance , manitoulin island's lake manitou is the world's largest lake on a freshwater island .
some of these lakes even have their own islands , like treasure island in lake mindemoya in manitoulin island the great lakes also have several peninsulas between them , including the door peninsula , the peninsulas of michigan , and the ontario peninsula .
some of these peninsulas even contain smaller peninsulas , like the keweenaw peninsula , the thumb peninsula , the bruce peninsula , and the niagara peninsula .
population centers on the peninsulas include grand rapids , michigan , detroit , michigan , london , ontario , hamilton , ontario , and toronto , ontario .
the saint lawrence seaway and great lakes waterway make the great lakes accessible to ocean-going vessels .
however , shifts in shipping to wider ocean-going container ships—which do not fit through the locks on these routes—have limited container shipping on the lakes .
most great lakes trade is of bulk material , and bulk freighters of seawaymax-size or less can move throughout the entire lakes and out to the atlantic .
larger ships are confined to working in the lakes themselves .
only barges can access the illinois waterway system providing access to the gulf of mexico via the mississippi river .
despite their vast size , large sections of the great lakes freeze over in winter , interrupting most shipping from january to march .
some icebreakers ply the lakes , keeping the shipping lanes open through other periods of ice on the lakes .
the great lakes are also connected by the chicago sanitary and ship canal to the gulf of mexico by way of the illinois river ( from the chicago river ) and the mississippi river .
an alternate track is via the illinois river ( from chicago ) , to the mississippi , up the ohio , and then through the tennessee–tombigbee waterway ( a combination of a series of rivers and lakes and canals ) , to mobile bay and the gulf of mexico .
commercial tug-and-barge traffic on these waterways is heavy .
pleasure boats can also enter or exit the great lakes by way of the erie canal and hudson river in new york .
the erie canal connects to the great lakes at the east end of lake erie ( at buffalo , new york ) and at the south side of lake ontario ( at oswego , new york ) .
in *num* , the lakes contained *num* % of the surface freshwater of north america ; if the water were evenly distributed over the entire continent's land area , it would reach a depth of *num* feet ( *num* .
*num* meters ) .
the source of water levels in the lakes is tied to what was left by melting glaciers when the lakes took their present form .
annually , only about *num* % is " new " water originating from rivers , precipitation , and groundwater springs that drain into the lakes .
historically , evaporation has been balanced by drainage , making the level of the lakes constant .
while the lake levels have been preserved , intensive human population growth only began in the region in the *ord* century and continues today .
at least two human water use activities have been identified as having the potential to affect the lakes ' levels : diversion ( the transfer of water to other watersheds ) and consumption ( substantially done today by the use of lake water to power and cool electric generation plants , resulting in evaporation ) .
the water level of lake michigan–huron had remained fairly constant over the *ord* century , but has nevertheless dropped more than *num* feet from the record high in *num* to the low of *num* .
one newspaper reported that the long-term average level has gone down about *num* inches because of dredging and subsequent erosion in the st .
clair river .
lake michigan–huron hit all-time record low levels in *num* ; according to the us army corps of engineers , the previous record low had been set in *num* .
by april *num* the water level had recovered to *num* inches ( *num* .
*num* cm ) more than the " long term monthly average " .
the great lakes contain *num* % of the world's surface fresh water : , or *num* .

3×10 liters ) .
this is enough water to cover the *num* contiguous u .

states to a uniform depth of .
although the lakes contain a large percentage of the world's fresh water , the great lakes supply only a small portion of u .

the total surface area of the lakes is approximately —nearly the same size as the united kingdom , and larger than the u .

states of new york , new jersey , connecticut , rhode island , massachusetts , vermont , and new hampshire combined .
name="taylor / schechter / / the great lakes coast measures approximately ; however , the length of a coastline is impossible to measure exactly and is not a well-defined measure ( see coastline paradox ) .
of the total of shoreline , canada borders approximately , while the remaining are bordered by the united states .
michigan has the longest shoreline of the united states , bordering roughly of shoreline , followed by wisconsin ( ) , new york ( ) , and ohio ( ) .
traversing the shoreline of all the lakes would cover a distance roughly equivalent to travelling half-way around the world at the equator .
it has been estimated that the foundational geology that created the conditions shaping the present day upper great lakes was laid from *num* .

*num* billion years ago , when two previously fused tectonic plates split apart and created the midcontinent rift , which crossed the great lakes tectonic zone .
a valley was formed providing a basin that eventually became modern day lake superior .
when a second fault line , the saint lawrence rift , formed approximately *num* million years ago , the basis for lakes ontario and erie were created , along with what would become the saint lawrence river .
the great lakes are estimated to have been formed at the end of the last glacial period ( the wisconsin glaciation ended *num* , *num* to *num* , *num* years ago ) , when the laurentide ice sheet receded .
the retreat of the ice sheet left behind a large amount of meltwater ( see lake algonquin , lake chicago , glacial lake iroquois , and champlain sea ) that filled up the basins that the glaciers had carved , thus creating the great lakes as we know them today .
because of the uneven nature of glacier erosion , some higher hills became great lakes islands .
the niagara escarpment follows the contour of the great lakes between new york and wisconsin .
land below the glaciers " rebounded " as it was uncovered .
since the glaciers covered some areas longer than others , this glacial rebound occurred at different rates .
a notable modern phenomenon is the formation of ice volcanoes over the lakes during wintertime .
storm-generated waves carve the lakes ' ice sheet and create conical mounds through the eruption of water and slush .
the process is only well-documented in the great lakes , and has been credited with sparing the southern shorelines from worse rocky erosion .
the great lakes have a humid continental climate , köppen climate classification dfa ( in southern areas ) and dfb ( in northern parts ) with varying influences from air masses from other regions including dry , cold arctic systems , mild pacific air masses from the west , and warm , wet tropical systems from the south and the gulf of mexico .
the lakes themselves also have a moderating effect on the climate ; they can also increase precipitation totals and produce lake effect snowfall .
the most well-known winter effect of the great lakes on regional weather is the " lake effect " in snowfall , which is sometimes very localized .
even late in winter , the lakes often have no icepack in the middle .
the prevailing winds from the west pick up the air and moisture from the lake surface , which is slightly warmer in relation to the cold surface winds above .
as the slightly warmer , moist air passes over the colder land surface , the moisture often produces concentrated , heavy snowfall that sets up in bands or " streamers " .
this is similar to the effect of warmer air dropping snow as it passes over mountain ranges .
during freezing weather with high winds , the " snow belts " receive regular snow fall from this localized weather pattern , especially along the eastern shores of the lakes .
snow belts are found in wisconsin , michigan , ohio , pennsylvania , and new york , united states ; and ontario , canada .
the lakes also moderate seasonal temperatures to some degree , but not with as large an influence as do large oceans ; they absorb heat and cool the air in summer , then slowly radiate that heat in autumn .
they protect against frost during transitional weather , and keep the summertime temperatures cooler than further inland .
this effect can be very localized and overridden by offshore wind patterns .
this temperature buffering produces areas known as " fruit belts " , where fruit can be produced that is typically grown much farther south .
for instance , western michigan has apple and cherry orchards , and vineyards cultivated adjacent to the lake shore as far north as the grand traverse bay and nottawasaga bay in central ontario .
the eastern shore of lake michigan and the southern shore of lake erie have many successful wineries because of the moderating effect , as does the niagara peninsula between lake erie and lake ontario .
a similar phenomenon allows wineries to flourish in the finger lakes region of new york , as well as in prince edward county , ontario on lake ontario's northeast shore .
related to the lake effect is the regular occurrence of fog over medium-sized areas , particularly along the shorelines of the lakes .
this is most noticeable along lake superior's shores .
the great lakes have been observed to help intensify storms , such as hurricane hazel in *num* , and the *num* goderich , ontario tornado , which moved onshore as a tornadic waterspout .
in *num* a rare tropical or subtropical storm was observed forming in lake huron , dubbed the *num* lake huron cyclone .
rather large severe thunderstorms covering wide areas are well known in the great lakes during mid-summer ; these mesoscale convective complexes or mccs can cause damage to wide swaths of forest and shatter glass in city buildings .
these storms mainly occur during the night , and the systems sometimes have small embedded tornadoes , but more often straight-line winds accompanied by intense lightning .
historically , the great lakes , in addition to their lake ecology , were surrounded by various forest ecoregions ( except in a relatively small area of southeast lake michigan where savanna or prairie occasionally intruded ) .
logging , urbanization , and agriculture uses have changed that relationship .
in the early *ord* century , lake superior's shores are *num* % forested , lake huron *num* % , lake ontario *num* % , lake michigan *num* % , and lake erie , where logging and urbanization has been most extensive , *num* % .
some of these forests are second or third growth ( i .
e .
they have been logged before , changing their composition ) .
at least *num* wildlife species are documented as becoming extinct since the arrival of europeans , and many more are threatened or endangered .
meanwhile , exotic and invasive species have also been introduced .
the organisms living on the bottom of shallow waters are similar to those found in smaller lakes .
the deep waters , however , contain organisms found only in deep , cold lakes of the northern latitudes .
these include the delicate opossum shrimp ( order mysida ) , the deepwater scud ( a crustacean of the order amphipoda ) , two types of copepods , and the deepwater sculpin ( a spiny , large-headed fish ) .
the great lakes are an important source of fishing .
early european settlers were astounded by both the variety and quantity of fish ; there were *num* different species in the great lakes .
throughout history , fish populations were the early indicator of the condition of the lakes and have remained one of the key indicators even in the current era of sophisticated analyses and measuring instruments .
according to the bi-national ( u .
s .
and canadian ) resource book , " the great lakes : an environmental atlas and resource book " : " the largest great lakes fish harvests were recorded in *num* and *num* at some [ *num* million pounds ] .
" by *num* , the new york legislature found it necessary to pass regulations curtailing obstructions to the natural migrations of atlantic salmon from lake erie into their spawning channels .
in the early *ord* century , the government of upper canada found it necessary to introduce similar legislation prohibiting the use of weirs and nets at the mouths of lake ontario's tributaries .
other protective legislation was passed , as well , but enforcement remained difficult .
on both sides of the canada–united states border , the proliferation of dams and impoundments have multiplied , necessitating more regulatory efforts .
concerns by the *ord* century included obstructions in the rivers which prevented salmon and lake sturgeon from reaching their spawning grounds .
the wisconsin fisheries commission noted a reduction of roughly *num* % in general fish harvests by *num* .
the states have removed dams from rivers where necessary .
overfishing has been cited as a possible reason for a decrease in population of various whitefish , important because of their culinary desirability and , hence , economic consequence .
moreover , between *num* and *num* , reported whitefish harvests declined from some *num* .
*num* million pounds ( *num* million kg ) to just over *num* million pounds ( *num* million kg ) .
by *num* , commercial fishermen on lake michigan were hauling in an average of *num* million pounds of fish annually .
by *num* , wisconsin's commercial fishing operations were motorized and mechanized , generating jobs for more than *num* , *num* workers , and hauling *num* million pounds per year .
the population of giant freshwater mussels was eliminated as the mussels were harvested for use as buttons by early great lakes entrepreneurs .
since *num* , the invasive quagga mussel has smothered the bottom of lake michigan almost from shore to shore , and their numbers are estimated at *num* trillion .
the influx of parasitic lamprey populations after the development of the erie canal and the much later welland canal led to the two federal governments of the us and canada working on joint proposals to control it .
by the mid-1950s , the lake trout populations of lakes michigan and huron were reduced , with the lamprey deemed largely to blame .
this led to the launch of the bi-national great lakes fishery commission .
"the great lakes : an environmental atlas and resource book " ( *num* ) noted : " only pockets remain of the once large commercial fishery .
" but , water quality improvements realized during the 1970s and 1980s , combined with successful salmonid stocking programs , have enabled the growth of a large recreational fishery .
the last commercial fisherman left milwaukee in *num* because of overfishing and anthropogenic changes to the biosphere .
since the *ord* century an estimated *num* new species have found their way into the great lakes ecosystem ; many have become invasive ; the overseas ship ballast and ship hull parasitism are causing severe economic and ecological impacts .
according to the inland seas education association , on average a new species enters the great lakes every eight months .
introductions into the great lakes include the zebra mussel , which was first discovered in *num* , and quagga mussel in *num* .
the mollusks are efficient filter feeders , competing with native mussels and reducing available food and spawning grounds for fish .
in addition , the mussels may be a nuisance to industries by clogging pipes .
the u .
s .
fish and wildlife service estimates that the economic impact of the zebra mussel could be about $5 billion over the next decade .
the alewife first entered the system west of lake ontario via 19th-century canals .
by the 1960s , the small silver fish had become a familiar nuisance to beach goers across lakes michigan , huron , and erie .
periodic mass dieoffs result in vast numbers of the fish washing up on shore ; estimates by various governments have placed the percentage of lake michigan's biomass , which was made up of alewives in the early 1960s , as high as *num* % .
in the late 1960s , the various state and federal governments began stocking several species of salmonids , including the native lake trout as well as non-native chinook and coho salmon ; by the 1980s , alewife populations had dropped drastically .
the ruffe , a small percid fish from eurasia , became the most abundant fish species in lake superior's saint louis river within five years of its detection in *num* .
its range , which has expanded to lake huron , poses a significant threat to the lower lake fishery .
five years after first being observed in the st .
clair river , the round goby can now be found in all of the great lakes .
the goby is considered undesirable for several reasons : it preys upon bottom-feeding fish , overruns optimal habitat , spawns multiple times a season , and can survive poor water quality conditions .
several species of exotic water fleas have accidentally been introduced into the great lakes , such as the spiny waterflea , " bythotrephes longimanus " , and the fishhook waterflea , " cercopagis pengoi " , potentially having an effect on the zooplankton population .
several species of crayfish have also been introduced that may contend with native crayfish populations .
more recently an electric fence has been set up across the chicago sanitary and ship canal in order to keep several species of invasive asian carp out of the area .
these fast-growing planktivorous fish have heavily colonized the mississippi and illinois river systems .
the sea lamprey , which has been particularly damaging to the native lake trout population , is another example of a marine invasive species in the great lakes .
invasive species , particularly zebra and quagga mussels , may be at least partially responsible for the collapse of the deepwater demersal fish community in lake huron , as well as drastic unprecedented changes in the zooplankton community of the lake .
native habitats and ecoregions in the great lakes region include : plant lists include : logging logging of the extensive forests in the great lakes region removed riparian and adjacent tree cover over rivers and streams , which provide shade , moderating water temperatures in fish spawning grounds .
removal of trees also destabilized the soil , with greater volumes washed into stream beds causing siltation of gravel beds , and more frequent flooding .
running cut logs down the tributary rivers into the great lakes also dislocated sediments .
in *num* , the new york fish commission determined that the dumping of sawmill waste ( chips and sawdust ) had impacted fish populations .
the first u .
s .
clean water act , passed by a congressional override after being vetoed by us president richard nixon in *num* , was a key piece of legislation , along with the bi-national great lakes water quality agreement signed by canada and the u .
s .
a variety of steps taken to process industrial and municipal pollution discharges into the system greatly improved water quality by the 1980s , and lake erie in particular is significantly cleaner .
discharge of toxic substances has been sharply reduced .
federal and state regulations control substances like pcbs .
the first of *num* " great lakes areas of concern " to be formally " de-listed " due to successful cleanup was ontario's collingwood harbour in *num* ; ontario's severn sound followed in *num* .
presque isle bay in pennsylvania is formally listed as in recovery , as is ontario's spanish harbour .
dozens of other areas of concern have received partial cleanups such as the rouge river ( michigan ) and waukegan harbor ( illinois ) .
phosphate detergents were historically a major source of nutrient to the great lakes algae blooms in particular in the warmer and shallower portions of the system such as lake erie , saginaw bay , green bay , and the southernmost portion of lake michigan .
by the mid-1980s , most jurisdictions bordering the great lakes had controlled phosphate detergents , resulting in sharp reductions in the frequency and extent of the blooms .
in *num* , news of a garbage patch of plastic pollution in the lakes was reported .
until *num* , mercury was not listed as a harmful chemical , according to the united states federal water quality administration .
within the past ten years mercury has become more apparent in water tests .
mercury compounds have been used in paper mills to prevent slime from forming during their production , and chemical companies have used mercury to separate chlorine from brine solutions .
studies conducted by the environmental protection agency have shown that when the mercury comes in contact with many of the bacteria and compounds in the fresh water , it forms the compound methyl mercury , which has a much greater impact on human health than elemental mercury due to a higher propensity for absorption .
this form of mercury is not detrimental to a majority of fish types , but is very detrimental to people and other wildlife animals who consume the fish .
mercury has been known for health related problems such as birth defects in humans and animals , and the near extinction of eagles in the great lakes region .
the amount of raw sewage dumped into the waters was the primary focus of both the first great lakes water quality agreement and federal laws passed in both countries during the 1970s .
implementation of secondary treatment of municipal sewage by major cities greatly reduced the routine discharge of untreated sewage during the 1970s and 1980s .
the international joint commission in *num* summarized the change : " since the early 1970s , the level of treatment to reduce pollution from waste water discharges to the great lakes has improved considerably .
this is a result of significant expenditures to date on both infrastructure and technology , and robust regulatory systems that have proven to be , on the whole , quite effective .
" the commission reported that all urban sewage treatment systems on the u .
s .
side of the lakes had implemented secondary treatment , as had all on the canadian side except for five small systems .
however contrary to federal laws in both countries , those treatment system upgrades have not yet eliminated combined sewer overflow events .
this describes when older sewerage systems , which combine storm water with sewage into single sewers heading to the treatment plant , are temporarily overwhelmed by heavy rainstorms .
local sewage treatment authorities then must release untreated effluent , a mix of rainwater and sewage , into local water bodies .
while enormous public investments such as the deep tunnel projects in chicago and milwaukee have greatly reduced the frequency and volume of these events , they have not been eliminated .
the number of such overflow events in ontario , for example , is flat according to the international joint commission .
reports about this issue on the u .
s .
side highlight five large municipal systems ( those of detroit , cleveland , buffalo , milwaukee and gary ) as being the largest current periodic sources of untreated discharges into the great lakes .
algae such as diatoms , along with other phytoplankton , are photosynthetic primary producers supporting the food web of the great lakes .
the changes in the size or in the function of the primary producers may have a direct or an indirect impact on the food web .
photosynthesis carried out by diatoms comprises about one fifth of the total photosynthesis .
by taking co2 out of the water , to photosynthesize , diatoms help to stabilize the ph of the water , as otherwise co2 would react with water making it more acidic .
diatoms acquire inorganic carbon thought passive diffusion of co2 and hco3 , as well they use carbonic anhydrase mediated active transport to speed up this process ( *num* ) .
large diatoms require more carbon uptake than smaller diatoms ( *num* ) .
there is a positive correlation between the surface area and the chlorophyll concentration of diatom cells ( *num* ) .
several native american tribes inhabited the region since at least *num* , *num* bc , after the end of the wisconsin glaciation .
the peoples of the great lakes traded with the hopewell culture from around *num* ad , as copper nuggets have been extracted from the region , and fashioned into ornaments and weapons in the mounds of southern ohio .
the brigantine " le griffon " , which was commissioned by rené-robert cavelier , sieur de la salle , was built at cayuga creek , near the southern end of the niagara river , and became the first known sailing ship to travel the upper great lakes on august *num* , *num* .
the rush–bagot treaty signed in *num* , after the war of *num* and the later treaty of washington eventually led to a complete disarmament of naval vessels in the great lakes .
nonetheless , both nations maintain coast guard vessels in the great lakes .
during settlement , the great lakes and its rivers were the only practical means of moving people and freight .
barges from middle north america were able to reach the atlantic ocean from the great lakes when the welland canal opened in *num* and the later erie canal opened in *num* .
by *num* , with the opening of the illinois and michigan canal at chicago , direct access to the mississippi river was possible from the lakes .
with these two canals an all-inland water route was provided between new york city and new orleans .
the main business of many of the passenger lines in the *ord* century was transporting immigrants .
many of the larger cities owe their existence to their position on the lakes as a freight destination as well as for being a magnet for immigrants .
after railroads and surface roads developed , the freight and passenger businesses dwindled and , except for ferries and a few foreign cruise ships , has now vanished .
the immigration routes still have an effect today .
immigrants often formed their own communities and some areas have a pronounced ethnicity , such as dutch , german , polish , finnish , and many others .
since many immigrants settled for a time in new england before moving westward , many areas on the u .
s .
side of the great lakes also have a new england feel , especially in home styles and accent .
since general freight these days is transported by railroads and trucks , domestic ships mostly move bulk cargoes , such as iron ore , coal and limestone for the steel industry .
the domestic bulk freight developed because of the nearby mines .
it was more economical to transport the ingredients for steel to centralized plants rather than try to make steel on the spot .
grain exports are also a major cargo on the lakes .
in the *ord* century and early *ord* centuries , iron and other ores such as copper were shipped south on ( downbound ships ) , and supplies , food , and coal were shipped north ( upbound ) .
because of the location of the coal fields in pennsylvania and west virginia , and the general northeast track of the appalachian mountains , railroads naturally developed shipping routes that went due north to ports such as erie , pennsylvania and ashtabula , ohio .
because the lake maritime community largely developed independently , it has some distinctive vocabulary .
ships , no matter the size , are called " boats " .
when the sailing ships gave way to steamships , they were called " steamboats"—the same term used on the mississippi .
the ships also have a distinctive design ( see lake freighter ) .
ships that primarily trade on the lakes are known as " lakers " .
foreign boats are known as " salties " .
one of the more common sights on the lakes has been since about *num* the *num* , 000‑by‑105-foot ( 305-by-32-meter ) , self-unloader .
this is a laker with a conveyor belt system that can unload itself by swinging a crane over the side .
today , the great lakes fleet is much smaller in numbers than it once was because of the increased use of overland freight , and a few larger ships replacing many small ones .
during world war ii , the risk of submarine attacks against coastal training facilities motivated the united states navy to operate two aircraft carriers on the great lakes , and .
both served as training ships to qualify naval aviators in carrier landing and takeoff .
lake champlain briefly became the sixth great lake of the united states on march *num* , *num* , when president clinton signed senate bill *num* .
this bill , which reauthorized the national sea grant program , contained a line declaring lake champlain to be a great lake .
not coincidentally , this status allows neighboring states to apply for additional federal research and education funds allocated to these national resources .
following a small uproar , the senate voted to revoke the designation on march *num* ( although new york and vermont universities would continue to receive funds to monitor and study the lake ) .
in the early years of the *ord* century , water levels in the great lakes were a concern .
researchers at the mowat centre said that low levels could cost $19bn by *num* .
except when the water is frozen during winter , more than *num* lake freighters operate continuously on the great lakes , which remain a major water transport corridor for bulk goods .
the great lakes waterway connects all the lakes ; the smaller saint lawrence seaway connects the lakes to the atlantic oceans .
some lake freighters are too large to use the seaway , and only operate on the waterway and lakes .
in *num* , *num* million net tons of dry bulk cargo were moved on the lakes .
this was , in order of volume : iron ore , grain and potash .
the iron ore and much of the stone and coal are used in the steel industry .
there is also some shipping of liquid and containerized cargo but most container ships cannot pass the locks on the saint lawrence seaway because the ships are too wide .
only four bridges are on the great lakes other than lake ontario because of the cost of building structures high enough for ships to pass under .
the blue water bridge is , for example , more than *num* feet high and more than a mile long .
the great lakes are used to supply drinking water to tens of millions of people in bordering areas .
this valuable resource is collectively administered by the state and provincial governments adjacent to the lakes , who have agreed to the great lakes compact to regulate water supply and use .
tourism and recreation are major industries on the great lakes .
a few small cruise ships operate on the great lakes including a couple of sailing ships .
sport fishing , commercial fishing , and native american fishing represent a u .
s .
$4 billion a year industry with salmon , whitefish , smelt , lake trout , bass and walleye being major catches .
many other water sports are practiced on the lakes such as yachting , sea kayaking , diving , kitesurfing , powerboating , and lake surfing .
the great lakes circle tour is a designated scenic road system connecting all of the great lakes and the saint lawrence river .
from *num* through *num* , palace steamers carried passengers and cargo around the great lakes .
in the first half of the *ord* century large luxurious passenger steamers sailed the lakes in opulence .
the detroit and cleveland navigation company had several vessels at the time and hired workers from all walks of life to help operate these vessels .
several ferries currently operate on the great lakes to carry passengers to various islands , including isle royale , drummond island , pelee island , mackinac island , beaver island , bois blanc island ( ontario ) , bois blanc island ( michigan ) , kelleys island , south bass island , north manitou island , south manitou island , harsens island , manitoulin island , and the toronto islands .
as of *num* , four car ferry services cross the great lakes , two on lake michigan : a steamer from ludington , michigan , to manitowoc , wisconsin , and a high speed catamaran from milwaukee to muskegon , michigan , one on lake erie : a boat from kingsville , ontario , or leamington , ontario , to pelee island , ontario , then onto sandusky , ohio , and one on lake huron : the m .
s .
" chi-cheemaun " runs between tobermory and south baymouth , manitoulin island , operated by the owen sound transportation company .
an international ferry across lake ontario from rochester , new york , to toronto ran during *num* and *num* , but is no longer in operation .
the large size of the great lakes increases the risk of water travel ; storms and reefs are common threats .
the lakes are prone to sudden and severe storms , in particular in the autumn , from late october until early december .
hundreds of ships have met their end on the lakes .
the greatest concentration of shipwrecks lies near thunder bay ( michigan ) , beneath lake huron , near the point where eastbound and westbound shipping lanes converge .
the lake superior shipwreck coast from grand marais , michigan , to whitefish point became known as the " graveyard of the great lakes " .
more vessels have been lost in the whitefish point area than any other part of lake superior .
the whitefish point underwater preserve serves as an underwater museum to protect the many shipwrecks in this area .
the first ship to sink in lake michigan was " le griffon " , also the first ship to sail the great lakes .
caught in a *num* storm while trading furs between green bay and michilimacinac , she was lost with all hands aboard .
its wreck may have been found in *num* , but a wreck subsequently discovered in a different location was also claimed in *num* to be " le griffon " .
the largest and last major freighter wrecked on the lakes was the , which sank on november *num* , *num* , just over offshore from whitefish point on lake superior .
the largest loss of life in a shipwreck out on the lakes may have been that of , wrecked in *num* with the loss of around *num* lives on lake michigan .
in an incident at a chicago dock in *num* , the rolled over while loading passengers , killing *num* .
in august *num* , the great lakes shipwreck historical society announced that it had found the wreckage of " cyprus " , a long , century-old ore carrier .
" cyprus " sank during a lake superior storm on october *num* , *num* , during its second voyage while hauling iron ore from superior , wisconsin , to buffalo , new york .
the entire crew of *num* drowned , except one , charles pitz , who floated on a life raft for almost seven hours .
in june *num* , deep sea divers in lake ontario found the wreck of the *num* royal navy warship in what has been described as an " archaeological miracle " .
there are no plans to raise her as the site is being treated as a war grave .
in june *num* , " l .
r .
doty " was found in lake michigan by an exploration diving team led by dive boat captain jitka hanakova from her boat the molly v .
the ship sank in october *num* , probably attempting to rescue a small schooner , " olive jeanette " , during a terrible storm .
still missing are the two last warships to sink in the great lakes , the french minesweepers , " inkerman " and " cerisoles " , which vanished in lake superior during a blizzard in *num* .
*num* lives were lost making it the largest loss of life in lake superior and the greatest unexplained loss of life in the great lakes .
related articles in *num* , a treaty gave access to the st .
lawrence river to the united states , and access to lake michigan to the dominion of canada .
the international joint commission was established in *num* to help prevent and resolve disputes relating to the use and quality of boundary waters , and to advise canada and the united states on questions related to water resources .
concerns over diversion of lake water are of concern to both americans and canadians .
some water is diverted through the chicago river to operate the illinois waterway but the flow is limited by treaty .
possible schemes for bottled water plants and diversion to dry regions of the continent raise concerns .
under the u .
s .
" water resources development act " , diversion of water from the great lakes basin requires the approval of all eight great lakes governors through the great lakes commission , which rarely occurs .
international treaties regulate large diversions .
in *num* , the canadian company nova group won approval from the province of ontario to withdraw of lake superior water annually to ship by tanker to asian countries .
public outcry forced the company to abandon the plan before it began .
since that time , the eight great lakes governors and the premiers of ontario and quebec have negotiated the great lakes-saint lawrence river basin sustainable water resources agreement and the great lakes-st .
lawrence river basin water resources compact that would prevent most future diversion proposals and all long-distance ones .
the agreements strengthen protection against abusive water withdrawal practices within the great lakes basin .
on december *num* , *num* , the governors and premiers signed these two agreements , the first of which is between all ten jurisdictions .
it is somewhat more detailed and protective , though its legal strength has not yet been tested in court .
the second , the great lakes compact , has been approved by the state legislatures of all eight states that border the great lakes as well as the u .
s .
congress , and was signed into law by president george w .
bush on october *num* , *num* .
the great lakes restoration initiative , described as " the largest investment in the great lakes in two decades , " was funded at $475 million in the u .
s .
federal government's fiscal year *num* budget , and $300 million in the fiscal year *num* budget .
through the program a coalition of federal agencies is making grants to local and state entities for toxics cleanups , wetlands and coastline restoration projects , and invasive species-related projects .
in *num* , the united states coast guard ( uscg ) proposed a plan to designate *num* areas in the great lakes , at least offshore , as permanent safety zones for live fire machine gun practice .
in august *num* , the plan was published in the federal register .
the uscg reserved the right to hold target practice whenever the weather allowed with a two-hour notice .
these firing ranges would be open to the public when not in use .
in response to requests from the public , the coast guard held a series of public meetings in nine u .
s .
cities to solicit comment .
during these meetings many people voiced concerns about the plan and its impact on the environment .
on december *num* , *num* , the coast guard announced its decision to withdraw the entire proposal .
officials said they would look into alternative ammunition , modifying the proposed zones and have more public dialogue before proposing a new plan .

abu bakr abū bakr aṣ-ṣiddīq ‘abdallāh bin abī quḥāfah ( ; *num* ce23 august *num* ce ) , popularly known as abu bakr , was a companion and—through his daughter aisha—a father-in-law of the islamic prophet muhammad .
abu bakr was born in mecca in *num* ce to uthman abu quhafa and salma umm al-khair .
he is commonly regarded as the fourth person to have accepted islam , after khadija bint khuwaylid , ali ibn abi talib , and zayd ibn harith .
abu bakr was present at a number of battles of islam , such as the battle of badr and the battle of uhud ; his role in the early battles of islam has been the subject of extensive analysis by historians .
abu bakr was present at the farewell pilgrimage , as well as the event of ghadir khumm , in *num* ce .
however , shortly after muhammad passed away , abu bakr and some others left the still-unburied body of muhammad and gathered at a place known as saqifa .
after lengthy debates that included violence , umar ibn al-khattab pledged allegiance to abu bakr at saqifa ; he was followed in this by two others at saqifa , as well as a group of bedouin tribesmen who had arrived at the scene .
saqifa was later described by the famous sunni historian al-tabari as " a scene from the period of jahiliya ( the pre-islamic era ) " .
abu bakr thus assumed power , ruling over the rashidun caliphate from *num* to *num* ce .
once in power , abu bakr launched the ridda wars to quell an outbreak of " apostasy " in various lands outside medina .
the ridda wars , however , were expanded to include the use of force against muslims who did not recognize abu bakr's government , instead of solely focusing on those who had left islam .
after the conclusion of the ridda wars , abu bakr launched campaigns into syria and persia , but died before their conclusion .
another significant event during abu bakr's reign was the seizure of the land of fadak from fatimah , muhammad's daughter .
in *num* ce , abu bakr fell ill from a sickness and died shortly thereafter .
he was succeeded by umar .
abu bakr's full name was abū bakr aṣ-ṣiddīq abd allah ibn ' uthman ibn aamir ibn amr ibn ka'ab ibn sa'ad ibn taym ( from whom the at-taymi al-quraishi ) ibn murrah ibn ka'ab ibn lu'ai ibn ghalib ibn fihr al-quraishi .
the lineage of abu bakr joined that of muhammad in the eighth degree in their common ancestor murrah ibn ka'b .
the patrilineal lineage of abu bakr was : abu bakr ; the son of uthman abu quhafa ; the son of amar ; the son of umru ; the son of saad ; the son of taym ; the son of murrah ; the son of kaab .
the lineage of muhammad was : muhammad ; the son of abd allah ibn abd al muttalib ; the son of abdul muttalib ; the son of hashim ibn ' abd manaf ; the son of abd manaf ibn qusai ; the son of qusai ibn kilab ; the son of kilab ibn murrah ; the son of murrah .
in arabic , the name " abd allah " means " servant of allah " .
one of his early titles , preceding his conversion to islam , was " atiqe " , " the saved one " .
muhammad later reaffirmed this title when he said that abu bakr is the " atiqe " ( the one saved from hell fire by god ) .
he was called " al-siddiq " ( the truthful ) by muhammad after he believed him in the event of isra and mi'raj when other people didn't , and ali confirmed that title several times .
there is a dispute over his name being abdullah .
ibn hajar in " al-isaabah " , vol .
*num* , p .
*num* and many other narrations , narrates from qasim ibn muhammad ibn abi bakr , " i asked ayesha the name of abu bakr .
she said abdullah .
i said people are saying ateeq .
she said abu quhafa had three children , one was ateeq , second mu’taq and third , otaiq .
all three names are similar and derived from the same root .
" he was mentioned in the quran as the " second of the two who lay in the cave " in reference to the event of hijra , where with muhammad he hid in the cave in jabal thawr from the meccan search party that was sent after them , thus being one of few who were given direct mention in the quran .
imam jafar al sadiq famously narrated how the title " siddiq " was given to abu bakr from muhammad .
jafar was a direct descendant of abu bakr from his maternal side , as well as being a descendant of ali from his father's side .
jafar al-sadiq was also the successor of the naqshbandi sufi order believed to be originating from abu bakr himself .
imam muhammad al baqir , the father of imam jafar sadiq , also called abu bakr with the title siddiq .
much of the available knowledge about muhammad comes through abu bakr's daughter , aisha .
after the death of abu bakr , her brother muhammad ibn abi bakr was raised by ali .
after muhammad ibn abi bakr was killed by the umayyads , aisha raised and taught her nephew al-qasim ibn muhammad ibn abi bakr .
aisha also taught another nephew urwah ibn zubayr .
he then taught his son hisham ibn urwah , who was the main teacher of malik ibn anas whose views many sunni follow .
qasim's mother was of ‘ali's family and his daughter farwah bint al-qasim , who married muhammad al-baqir , was the mother of jafar al-sadiq .
therefore al-qasim was the grandson of the first caliph abu bakr and the grandfather of ja'far al-sadiq .
another of abu bakr's grandsons , abd allah ibn al-zubayr , was very close to husayn bin ali .
after hussein ibn ali was betrayed by the people of kufa and killed by the army of yazid i , the umayyad ruler , abd allah ibn al-zubayr confronted yazid and expelled him from iraq , southern arabia and the greater part of syria , and parts of egypt .
following a lengthy campaign , on his last hour abd allah ibn al-zubayr asked his mother asma ' bint abu bakr , the daughter of the first caliph , for advice .
asma ' bint abu bakr replied to her son : " you know better in your own self , that if you are upon the truth and you are calling towards the truth go forth , for people more honourable than you have been killed and if you are not upon the truth , then what an evil son you are and you have destroyed yourself and those who are with you .
if you say , that if you are upon the truth and you will be killed at the hands of others , then you will not truly be free " .
abd allah ibn al-zubayr left and was later also killed and crucified by the syrian army now under the control of the umayyads .
abu bakr was born in mecca some time in *num* ce , to a rich family in the banu taym clan of the quraysh tribe .
abu bakr's father's name was uthman abu quhafa ( nicknamed " abu quhafa " ) and his mother was salma bint sakhar ( nicknamed " umm-ul-khair " ) .
he spent his early childhood like other arab children of the time , among the bedouins who called themselves " ahl-i-ba'eer"- the people of the camel , and developed a particular fondness for camels .
in his early years he played with the camel calves and goats , and his love for camels earned him the nickname " "abu bakr" " , the father of the camel's calf .
when abu bakr was *num* years old , he went to syria along with his father with the merchants ' caravan .
muhammad , who was *num* years old at the time , was also with the caravan .
in *num* at the age of *num* , abu bakr went into trade and adopted the profession of cloth merchant , which was the family's business .
in the coming years abu bakr traveled extensively with caravans .
business trips took him to yemen , syria , and elsewhere .
these travels brought him wealth and added to his experience .
his business flourished and he rose in the scale of social importance .
though his father , uthman abu quhafa , was still alive , he came to be recognized as chief of his tribe .
like other children of the rich meccan merchant families , abu bakr was literate and developed a fondness for poetry .
he used to attend the annual fair at ukaz , and participate in poetical symposia .
he had a very good memory and had a good knowledge of the genealogy of the arab tribes , their stories and their politics .
a story is preserved that once when he was a child , his father took him to the kaaba , and asked him to pray before the idols .
his father went away to attend to some other business , and abu bakr was left alone with the idols .
addressing an idol , abu bakr said " o my god , i am in need of beautiful clothes ; bestow them on me " .
the idol remained indifferent .
then he addressed another idol saying " o god , give me some delicious food .
see that i am so hungry " .
the idol remained cold .
that exhausted the patience of young abu bakr .
he lifted a stone , and addressing an idol said " here i am aiming a stone ; if you are a god protect yourself " .
abu bakr hurled the stone at the idol and left the kaaba .
thereafter , he never went to the kaaba to pray to the idols .
abu bakr was a thin man with white skin .
tabari relates ( suyuti also relates the same through ibn sa'd al-baghdadi's report ) from aisha her description of abu bakr : he was a man with fair skin , thin , emaciated , with a sparse beard , a slightly hunched frame , sunken eyes and protruding forehead , and the bases of his fingers were hairless .
he remained a " hanif " until converting to islam and never worshipped idols .
on his return from a business trip from yemen , friends informed him that in his absence muhammad had declared himself the messenger of god and proclaimed a new religion .
tabari , the most famous muslim historian , in his ta'rikh quotes from muhammad bin sa'ad bin abi waqqas , who said : other sunni and all shi'a muslims maintain that the second person to publicly accept muhammed as the messenger of god was ali ibn abi talib , the first being muhammad's wife khadija .
ibn kathir in his al bidaya wal nihayah disregards the above .
he stated that the first woman to embrace islam was khadijah .
zaid bin haarithah was the first freed slave to embrace islam .
and ali ibn abi talib was the first child to embrace islam for he has not even reached the age of puberty at that time .
and abu bakr was the first free man to embrace islam .
his wife qutaylah bint abd-al-uzza did not accept islam and he divorced her .
his other wife , um ruman , became a muslim .
all his children except abdu'l-rahman ibn abu bakr accepted islam , and abu bakr separated himself from his son abdu'l-rahman .
his conversion brought many people to islam .
he persuaded his intimate friends to convert to islam .
and presented islam to others in such a way that many of his friends accepted islam .
those who converted to islam at the insistence of abu bakr were : abu bakr's acceptance proved to be a milestone in muhammad's mission .
slavery was common in mecca , and many slaves accepted islam .
when an ordinary free man accepted islam , despite opposition , he would enjoy the protection of his tribe .
for slaves however , there was no such protection and they commonly experienced persecution .
abu bakr felt compassion for slaves , so he purchased eight slaves ( four men and four women ) and then freed them , paying *num* , *num* dinar for their freedom .
the men were the women were : most of the slaves liberated by abu bakr were either women or old and frail men .
the father of abu bakr asked him why he doesn't liberate strong and young slaves who could be a source of strength for him , abu bakr replied that he was freeing the slaves for the sake of allah , and not for his own sake .
for three years after the birth of islam , muslims kept secret their faith , and prayed in secret .
in *num* muhammad was commanded by god to call people to islam openly .
the first public address inviting people to offer allegiance to muhammad was delivered by abu bakr .
in a fit of fury the young men of the quraysh tribe rushed at abu bakr , and beat him mercilessly till he lost consciousness .
following this incident abu bakr's mother converted to islam .
abu bakr was persecuted many times by the quraysh .
abu bakr's beliefs would have been defended by his own clan , but not by the entire quraysh tribe .
in *num* , the quraysh enforced a boycott against the banu hashim .
muhammad along with his supporters from banu hashim , were cut off in a pass away from mecca .
all social relations with the banu hashim were cut off and their state was that of imprisonment .
before it many muslims migrated to abyssinia ( now ethiopia ) .
abu bakr , feeling distressed , set out for yemen and then to abyssinia from there .
he met a friend of his named ad-dughna ( chief of the qarah tribe ) outside mecca , who invited abu bakr to seek his protection against the quraysh .
abu bakr went back to mecca , it was a relief for him , but soon due to the pressure of quraysh , ad-dughna was forced to renounce his protection .
once again the quraysh were free to persecute abu bakr .
in *num* , muhammad's uncle and protector , abu talib ibn abd al-muttalib , and muhammad's wife khadija died .
abu bakr's daughter aisha was engaged to muhammad , however it was decided that the actual marriage ceremony would be held later .
in *num* abu bakr was the first person to testify to muhammad's isra and mi'raj ( night journey ) .
in *num* , on the invitation of the muslims of medina , muhammad ordered muslims to migrate to medina .
the migration began in batches .
ali was the last to remain in mecca , entrusted with responsibility for settling any loans the muslims had taken , and famously slept in the bed of muhammad when the quraysh led by ikrima attempted to murder muhammad as he slept .
meanwhile , abu bakr accompanied muhammad in his migration for medina .
due to the danger of the quraysh , they did not take the road to medina .
they moved in the opposite direction , and took refuge in a cave in jabal thawr some five miles south of mecca .
`abdullah ibn abi bakr , the son of abu bakr , would listen to the plans and talks of the quraysh , and at night he would carry the news to the fugitives in the cave .
asma bint abi bakr , the daughter of abu bakr , brought them meals every day .
aamir , a servant of abu bakr , would bring a flock of goats to the mouth of the cave every night where they were milked .
the quraysh sent search parties in all directions .
one party came close to the entrance to the cave , but was unable to sight them .
due to this , qur'an verse was revealed .
aisha , abu sa‘id al-khudri and abdullah ibn abbas in interpreting this verse said that abu bakr was the companion who stayed with muhammad in the cave .
after staying at the cave for three days and three nights , abu bakr and muhammad proceed to medina , staying for some time at quba , a suburb of medina .
in medina , muhammad decided to construct a mosque .
a piece of land was chosen and the price of the land was paid for by abu bakr .
muslims constructed a mosque named al-masjid al-nabawi at the site and abu bakr also took part in construction .
abu bakr was paired with khaarij ah bin zaid ansari ( who was from medina ) as a brother in faith .
abu bakr's relationship with khaarjah was most cordial , which was further strengthened when abu bakr married habiba , a daughter of khaarijah .
khaarij ah bin zaid ansari used to live at sunh , a suburb of medina , and abu bakr also settled there .
after abu bakr's family arrived in medina he bought another house near muhammad's .
the climate of mecca was dry , but the climate of medina was damp and this adversely affected the health of the immigrants , so that on arrival most of them fell sick .
abu bakr also suffered from fever for several days and during this time he was attended to by khaarijah and his family .
at mecca , abu bakr was a trader in cloth and he started the same business in medina .
he was a wholesaler , and had his store at sunh , and from there cloth was supplied to the market at medina .
soon his business flourished at medina .
early in *num* , abu bakr's daughter aisha , who was already engaged to muhammad , was handed over to muhammad in a simple marriage ceremony , and this further strengthened the relation between abu bakr and muhammad .
in *num* abu bakr was involved in the first battle between the muslims and the quraysh of mecca , known as the battle of badr , but did not fight , instead acting as one of the guards of muhammad's tent .
in *num* , abu bakr participated in the battle of uhud .
after the fighting began , the tide of the battle turned at first in the muslims ' favor , in large part due to the actions of ali ibn abi talib , hamza ibn abdul muttalib , and abu dujana .
however , two events led to the muslims losing the battle : the death of hamza and many of the rank-and-file members of the muslim army abandoning their positions .
many of those muslims assumed that they had already won the battle , so in an attempt to collect booty from their attackers , they left their positions , against the orders of muhammad .
the muslims ' opponents , the army of abu sufyan , took advantage of this to attack the muslims ' army .
in the ensuing confusion , in which many muslim lives were lost , a man named mus‘ab ibn ' umair was killed .
when he died ( although some reports say that it was instead when husayl ibn jabir died ) , a call was raised that muhammad had died ( which he had not ) , and this also led to many of the muslims fleeing the battlefield ; only a small number of muslims , such as ali and abu dujana , stayed to protect muhammad .
it has been mentioned in multiple reports that abu bakr and umar were among the muslims who fled when they were not supposed to .
in *num* he participated in the battle of the trench and also in the invasion of banu qurayza .
in this battle , muhammad divided the ditch into a number of sectors and a contingent was posted to guard each sector .
one of such contingents was under the command of abu bakr .
the enemy made frequent assaults in the attempt to cross the ditch .
all such assaults were repulsed .
abu bakr showed great courage in guarding the belt of the trench in his sector .
to commemorate this event a mosque was later constructed at the site where abu bakr had heroically repulsed the charges of the enemy .
the mosque was later known as ' masjid-i-siddiq ' .
in *num* he participated in treaty of hudaybiyyah and was made one of the witnesses over the pact .
abu bakr took part in the battle of khaybar .
khaybar had eight fortresses ; the strongest and most well-guarded fortress was called al-qamus .
muhammad sent abu bakr with a group of warriors to attempt to conquer the fortress ; however , abu bakr was unsuccessful in capturing the fortress .
muhammad also sent umar with a group of warriors , but umar could not conquer al-qamus either .
some other muslims also attempted to capture the fort , but they were unsuccessful as well .
finally , muhammad sent ali , who was victorious .
ali defeated the marhab , the leader of the opponents of islam , thus giving the muslims a victory .
in *num* muhammad sent ' amr ibn al-'as to zaat-ul-sallasal from where he called for reinforcements and muhammad sent abu ubaidah ibn al-jarrah .
commanding an army under him were abu bakr and umar and they attacked and defeated the enemy .
in *num* when muslim armies rushed for the conquest of mecca , abu bakr was a part of the army .
before the conquest of mecca his father uthman abu quhafa converted to islam .
in *num* he was part of battle of hunayn and siege of ta'if .
in the battle of hunayn as the muslim army passed through the valley of hunayn some eleven miles north east of mecca a rain of arrows fell on it let loose by a group of archers of the hostile tribes that lay hid in the mountain pass .
taken unaware the advance guard of the muslim army fled in panic .
there was considerable confusion , and the camels , horses and men ran into one another in the attempt to seek cover .
muhammad stood firm .
there were only nine companions around him including abu bakr .
all the rest had fled .
under the instructions of muhammad , abbas shouted at the top of his voice " o muslims come to the prophet of allah " .
the call was heard by the muslim soldiers and they gathered beside muhammad .
when the muslim had gathered in sufficient number , muhammad ordered a charge against the enemy .
in the hand-to-hand fight that followed the tribes were routed and they fled to autas .
muhammad posted a contingent to guard the hunayn pass and led the main army to autas .
in the confrontation at autas the tribes could not withstand the muslim onslaught .
finding the resistance useless the tribes broke the camp and retired to ta'if .
abu bakr was commissioned by muhammad to lead the attack against ta'if .
from autas the muslim forces set out for ta'if .
the tribes shut themselves in the fort and refused to come out in the open .
the muslim employed catapults to throw stones in the town , but this did not lead to any tangible results .
the muslim tried the testudo device whereunder a group of soldiers shielded by a cover of cowhide advanced to set fire to the gate .
the enemy threw red hot scraps of iron on the testudo which made it ineffective .
the siege dragged on for two weeks , and still there was no sign of the fall of the fort .
muhammad held a council of war .
abu bakr advised that the siege might be raised and that god would himself make arrangements for the fall of the fort .
the advice was accepted , and in february *num* , the siege of ta'if was raised and the muslim army returned to mecca .
a few days later malik bin auf the commander , came to mecca and became a muslim .
thus the forecast of abu bakr came to be fulfilled , and the god himself arranged for the surrender of ta'if .
in *num* ad , muhammad sent from medina a delegation of three hundred muslims to perform the hajj according to the new islamic way .
abu bakr was appointed as the leader of the delegates .
the day after abu bakr and his party had left for hajj , muhammad received a new revelation : surah tawbah , the ninth chapter of the qur'an .
it is related that when this revelation came , someone suggested to muhammad that he should send news of it to abu bakr .
muhammad said that only a man of his house could proclaim the revelation .
muhammad summoned ali , and asked him to proclaim a portion of surah tawbah to the people on the day of sacrifice when they assembled at mina .
ali went forth on muhammad's slit-eared camel , and overtook abu bakr .
when ali joined the party , abu bakr wanted to know whether he had come to give orders or to convey them .
ali said that he had not come to replace abu bakr as amir-ul-hajj , and that his only mission was to convey a special message to the people on behalf of muhammad .
at mecca , abu bakr presided at the hajj ceremony , and ali read the proclamation on behalf of muhammad .
the main points of the proclamation were : from the day this proclamation was made a new era dawned in arabia .
henceforward islam alone was to be supreme in arabia .
abu bakr also led one military campaign as commander , known as expedition of abu bakr as-siddiq , which took place in nejd , in july *num* ad ( *ord* month 7ah in the islamic calendar ) .
abu bakr led a large platoon in nejd on the order of muhammad .
many were killed and taken as prisoner .
the sunni hadith collection " sunan abu dawud " mentions the event abu bakr attended the event of ghadir khumm , which took place a few months before muhammad passed away .
according to both shia and sunni sources , he was among the many who pledged allegiance to ali at the event .
in medina , after the farewell pilgrimage and the event of ghadir khumm and shortly before his death , muhammad ordered an army under the command of usama bin zayd .
he commanded all the companions , except for his family , to go with usama to syria to avenge the muslims’ defeat at the battle of mu'tah .
muhammad gave usama the banner of islam on the *ord* day of the islamic month of safar in the year *num* a .
h .
abu bakr and umar were among those that muhammad commanded to join usama’s army .
however , abu bakr and umar resisted going under the command of usama because they thought that he , who was *num* or *num* at the time , was too young to lead an army , despite muhammad’s teachings that age and standing in society did not necessarily correspond to being a good general .
in response to these worries , the prophet said : " o arabs ! you are miserable because i have appointed usama as your general , and you are raising questions if he is qualified to lead you in war .
i know you are the same people who had raised the same question about his father .
by god , usama is qualified to be your general just as his father was qualified to be a general .
now obey his orders and go .
" whenever muhammad felt any relief from his fatal sickness , he would inquire as to whether usama’s army had left for syria yet , and would continue urging his companions to leave for syria .
muhammad even reportedly said , " usama's army must leave at once .
may allah curse those men who do not go with him .
" however , while a few companions were ready to join usama’s army , many other companions , including abu bakr and umar , disobeyed muhammad’s orders .
it is also noted that this was the only battle expedition where muhammad urged his companions to go the battle no matter what ; for other battles , if someone was unable to go to the fight , muhammad would let them stay at home .
during muhammad's lifetime , the muslims in medina were divided into two groups : the ansar , who were originally from medina , and the muhajirun , who had converted to islam in mecca and migrated to medina with muhammad .
during muhammad's rule in medina , they were satisfied , and they were glad when muhammad announced that ali would be his successor at the event of ghadir khumm , as they knew that ali would continue muhammad's fair policies towards them .
however , when some of the muhajirun refused to obey muhammad's orders to follow usama bin zayd to syria or to give him pen and paper to make a will , the ansar knew that some of the muhajirun were trying to take power upon muhammad's death .
they were worried that the rule of a muhajirun ( a foreigner , in their eyes ) , other than muhammad or ali , ruling over them would lead to their eventual oppression .
thus , when they saw some of the muhajirun planning on taking power upon muhammad's death , they thought they would be just as good candidates for power as the muhajirun .
thus , when muhammad died , some of the ansar went to a place known as saqifa , where they nominated sa'd ibn ubadah to be the leader .
some spies among the ansar informed umar , who had been in medina at the time , about what was happening in saqifa .
umar looked for abu bakr , but he was not in medina at the time ; he was in suk with his new wife .
umar , desperate to prevent the ansar declaring saad ibn ubada to be the caliph , offered to pledge allegiance to abu ubaidah ibn al-jarrah ( despite the previous pledges of allegiance of the muslims , including umar , to ali ) .
abu ubaidah refused , however , as he believed that abu bakr was more worthy than he was for leadership .
desperate to buy time , umar proclaimed that muhammad was not actually dead ; he threatened to kill anyone who said otherwise .
abu bakr then arrived in medina and calmed umar down , giving a convincing argument that muhammad was dead .
abu bakr , umar , and abu ubaidah , leaving the still-unburied body of muhammad , then went to saqifa .
the meeting in saqifa , which is said to have been attended by fourteen people , took place while ali was performing muhammad's funeral rites .
the ansar and the three muhajirun at saqifa ( abu bakr , umar , and abu ubaidah ) entered into a length debate about who was more qualified to have leadership .
the ansar suggested having two leaders , one from the muhajirun and one from the ansar , while abu bakr stated that the muhajirun should be the leaders and the ansar their ministers ( which did not come to fruition ) .
debate continued until it reached a turn when bashir ibn sa'ad , an ansar who was jealous of saad ibn ubada , gave a speech supporting abu bakr , umar , and abu ubaidah .
abu bakr then told the ansar to pledge allegiance to either umar or abu ubaidah .
umar refused and instead pledged allegiance to abu bakr ; abu ubaidah and bashir followed umar in doing so .
hubab ibn al-mandhir then gave a short speech in which he called bashir " a traitor to [ his ] own people .
" after that , a group of bedouin tribesmen arrived .
they were opponents of the ansar , and when they saw the three pledges of allegiance to abu bakr , they pledged allegiance to abu bakr as well .
the debates between the ansar and the three muhajirun at saqifa was not peaceful , but rather contained violence and even bloodshed ; al-tabari reported that it was " truly a scene from the period of jahiliya ( the pre-islamic era ) .
" after assuming the office of caliphate , abu bakr's first address was as follows : abu bakr's reign lasted for *num* months , during which he crushed the rebellion of the arab tribes throughout the arabian peninsula in the successful ridda wars .
in the last months of his rule , he sent khalid ibn al-walid on conquests against the sassanid empire in mesopotamia and against the byzantine empire in syria .
this would set in motion a historical trajectory ( continued later on by umar and uthman ibn affan ) that in just a few short decades would lead to one of the largest empires in history .
he had little time to pay attention to the administration of state , though state affairs remained stable during his caliphate .
on the advice of umar and abu ubaidah ibn al-jarrah he agreed to have a salary from state treasury and abolish his cloth trade .
after muhammad's death , apostasy arose in many areas outside medina through the rise of several false prophets .
abu bakr sent troops against the claimants and their forces and successfully defeated them .
however , the wars against apostasy were expanded to include the use of force against tribes who opposed the rule of abu bakr .
one such infamous incident was the massacre of the tribe of banu yerbo .
during muhammad's life , malik ibn nuweira was the revenue officer for banu yerbo ; he collected tax money from banu yerbo and sent it to medina .
upon muhammad's death , however , he stopped collecting taxes and waited to hear how the new government had formed before sending any more money to medina .
abu bakr sent a force led by khalid ibn al-walid to banu yerbo .
khalid killed malik , despite the fact that malik still followed islam and not the false prophets .
khalid then " married " malik's widow , less than *num* hours after malik's death , a practice unacceptable in islam .
khalid also killed and captured many , if not all , the other members of banu yerbo .
umar demanded that abu bakr dismiss khalid and put him on trial for murder and adultery , but abu bakr reportedly said that khalid had made " an error of judgement " and let him go .
another version of the response to khalid's actions claims that khalid did not order malik's execution but that his orders to the guards had been misunderstood , and that abu bakr accepted khalid's excuse .
the ridda wars were over in approximately one year .
after the conclusion of the ridda wars , abu bakr did not want the troops to remain idle , so he launched expeditions into persia and syria .
he reportedly assigned amr ibn al-aas to palestine and shurahbil ibn hasana and yazid ibn abu sufyan to damascus .
abu bakr , however , died before the expeditions into persia and syria were concluded .
on *num* august *num* , abu bakr fell sick and did not recover .
he developed high fever and was confined to bed .
his illness was prolonged , and when his condition worsened , he felt that his end was near .
realizing his death was near , he sent for ali and requested him to perform his ghusl since ali had also done it for muhammad .
abu bakr felt that he should nominate his successor so that the issue should not be a cause of dissension among the muslims after his death , though there was already controversy over ali not having been appointed .
he appointed umar as his successor after discussing with some companions .
some of them favored the nomination and others disliked it , due to the tough nature of umar .
abu bakr thus dictated his last testament to uthman ibn affan as follows : abu bakr next asked aisha as to how many pieces of cloth were used for muhammad's shroud .
aisha said that three pieces had been used .
abu bakr thereupon desired the same number for his own shroud .
on monday , *num* august *num* ( hijri : *ord* of jamadi-ui- akhir of the *ord* ah ) , abu bakr died .
the funeral prayer was led by umar .
he was buried the same night by the side of muhammad's grave in aisha's house near al-masjid al-nabawi today there are many families which are the descendants of abu bakr .
most of them are known by the name siddiqui and al-bakri or al-sideeqi ( al-bakri ) ( ( in arabic ) ) .
but they are also known by some other names in different localities .
for example , in east ethiopia , siddiqis are usually called qallu , which means " people of the religion " , as they were the first to bring islam to this area .
in somalia , they are commonly known as sheekhaal and they are well respected by other somali clans .
in bangladesh , they are known by the name of qureshi .
there are also al-sedeki or sedeki families in saudi arabia , egypt , syria , yemen , iraq and other places in the arabia peninsula .
all the descendants of abu bakr , their ancestors are : abdurahman ibn abu bakr and muhammad ibn abu bakr .
the al-bakri family in egypt are the descendants of muhammad ibn abu bakr while the sheekhaal or fiqi umar family found in somalia , ethiopia and kenya and the aala bakeri families found in the arabia peninsula are the descendants of abdurahman ibn abu bakr .
though the period of his caliphate covers only two years , two months and fifteen days , it included successful invasions of the two most powerful empires of the time : the sassanid empire and byzantine empire .
abu bakr had the distinction of being the first caliph in the history of islam and also the first caliph to nominate a successor .
he was the only caliph in the history of islam who refunded to the state treasury at the time of his death the entire amount of the allowance that he had drawn during the period of his caliphate .
he is revered for being the first muslim ruler to establish : he has the distinction of purchasing the land for al-masjid al-nabawi .
sunni muslims believe that abu bakr is the best man of all the human beings after the prophets .
they also consider abu bakr as one of the ten promised paradise ( " al-‘ashara al-mubashshara " ) whom muhammad had testified were destined for paradise .
he is regarded as the " successor of allah's messenger " ( " khalifa rasulullah " ) , and first of the rightly guided caliphs – i .
e .
rashidun and being the rightful successor to muhammad .
abu bakr had always been the closest friend and confidant of muhammad throughout his life .
he was always there beside muhammad at every major event .
it was abu bakr's wisdom that muhammad always honored .
abu bakr is regarded to be among best persons from the followers of muhammad , as umar ibn khattab stated that " if the faith of abu bakr was weighed against the faith of the people of the earth , the faith of abu bakr would outweigh the others .
" the twelver shia ( as the main branch of shia islam , with *num* % of all shias ) believe that ali ibn abi talib was supposed to assume the caliphate , and that he had been publicly and unambiguously appointed by muhammad as his successor at ghadir khumm .
it is also believed that abu bakr and umar conspired to take over power in the muslim nation after muhammad's death , in a coup d'état against ali .
the twelver shi'a do not view abu bakr's being with muhammad in the cave when the two fled mecca as a meritorious act and indeed find significant criticism of abu bakr in the qur'anic verse of the cave .
most of twelver shia criticize abu bakr because , after muhammad's death , abu bakr refused to grant muhammad's daughter , fatimah , the lands of the village of fadak which she claimed her father had given to her as a gift before his death .
he refused to accept the testimony of her witnesses , so she claimed the land would still belong to her as inheritance from her deceased father .
however , abu bakr replied by saying that muhammad had told him that the prophets of god do not leave as inheritance any worldly possessions and on this basis he refused to give her the lands of fadak .
however , as sayed ali asgher razwy notes in his book " a restatement of the history of islam & muslims " , muhammad inherited a maid servant , five camels , and ten sheep .
this proves that prophets can receive inheritance , and can pass on inheritance to others as well .
in addition , shias claim that muhammad had given fadak to fatimah during his lifetime , and fadak was therefore a gift to fatimah , not inheritance .
this view has also been supported some sunnis , such as the abbasid ruler al-ma'mun .
the twelver shia accuse him of participating in the burning of the house of ali and fatima .
the twelver shia believe that abu bakr sent khalid ibn walid to crush those who were in favour of ali's caliphate ( " see ridda wars " ) .
the twelver shia strongly refute the idea that abu bakr or umar were instrumental in the collection or preservation of the " qur'an " , claiming that they should have accepted the copy of the book in the possession of ali .
after the death of abu bakr , ali raised muhammad ibn abi bakr .
the twelver shia view muhammad ibn abi bakr as one of the companions of ali .
when muhammad ibn abi bakr was killed by the ummayads , aisha , the wife of muhammad and also a renowned scholar of her time , raised and taught her nephew qasim ibn muhammad ibn abu bakr .
qasim ibn muhammad ibn abu bakr's mother was from ali's family and qasim's daughter farwah bint al-qasim was married to muhammad al-baqir and was the mother of jafar al-sadiq .
therefore , qasim ibn muhammad ibn abu bakr was the grand son of abu bakr the first caliph and the grand father of jafar al-sadiq .
zaydis , the largest group amongst the shia before the safavid dynasty and currently the second largest group ( although its population is only about *num* % of all shia muslims ) , believe that on the last hour of zayd ibn ali ( the uncle of jafar al-sadiq ) , he was betrayed by the people in kufa who said to him : " may god have mercy on you ! what do you have to say on the matter of abu bakr and umar ibn al-khattab ? " zayd ibn ali said , " i have not heard anyone in my family renouncing them both nor saying anything but good about them .

armed forces of equatorial guinea the armed forces of equatorial guinea ( in spanish : " fuerzas armadas de guinea ecuatorial " ) consists of approximately *num* , *num* service members .
the army has almost *num* , *num* soldiers , the police *num* paramilitary men , the navy *num* service members , and the air force about *num* members .
there is also a gendarmerie , but the number of members is unknown .
the gendarmerie is a new branch of the service in which training and education is being supported by the french military cooperation in equatorial guinea .
military appointments are all reviewed by president teodoro obiang , and few of the native militiamen come from outside of obiang's mongomo-based esangui clan .
obiang was a general when he overthrew his uncle , francisco macías nguema .
overall the military is poorly trained and equipped .
it has mostly small arms , rpgs , and mortars .
almost none of its soviet-style light-armored vehicles or trucks are operational .
the armed forces were reorganized in *num* .
in *num* , the united states donated a 68-foot patrol boat to the equatoguinean navy to patrol its exclusive economic zone .

military-to-military engagement has been dormant since *num* ( the year of the last joint combined exchange training exercise ) .
between *num* and *num* , service members went regularly to the united states on the international military education training program , after which funding for this program for equatorial guinea ceased .
the government spent *num* .
*num* % of its annual budget on defense in *num* and *num* .
*num* % of its budget on defense in *num* .
it recently acquired some chinese artillery pieces , some ukrainian patrol boats , and some ukrainian helicopter gunships .
the number of paved airports in equatorial guinea can be counted on one hand , and as such the number of airplanes operated by the air force is small .
the equatoguineans rely on foreigners to operate and maintain this equipment as they are not sufficiently trained to do so .
cooper and weinert *num* says that all aircraft are based on the military side of malabo international airport .
in *num* , a report said " the oil companies do not view equatorial guinea's military – a product of decades of brutal dictatorial rule – with much confidence .
the army is believed to have only about *num* , *num* men under arms , the navy *num* , and the air force *num* .
seven of the army's nine generals are relatives of the president ; the other two are from his tribe .
there is no clear command structure , the level of discipline is low , and professionalism and training are almost non-existent , according to locals and foreign oil workers .
even the presidential guard – an indication of the lack of trust in the country's forces – is composed of *num* moroccan troops .

on *num* november *num* the zimbabwe defence forces deployed a training contingent to the equatorial guinea to train the country's military officers on operational and logistic matters following an urgent request by the west african country .
the security personnel contingent , is composed of members of the zimbabwe national army and air force of zimbabwe .
the air force of equatorial guinea consists of seven fixed wing aircraft and nine helicopters providing ground support , transport , sar , and training .
as piracy and robbery at sea is a significant threat in the gulf of guinea , the country is investing heavily in its navy to protect its oil installations from these and other security challenges .
in *num* a brazilian corvette was purchased , and renamed the ' bata ' .
on *num* june *num* the frigate wele nzas was commissioned and became the flagship for the navy of equatorial guinea .
frisians the frisians are a germanic ethnic group indigenous to the coastal parts of the netherlands and northwestern germany .
they inhabit an area known as frisia and are concentrated in the dutch provinces of friesland and groningen and , in germany , east frisia and north frisia ( which was a part of denmark until *num* ) .
the frisian languages are still spoken by more than *num* , *num* people ; west frisian is officially recognized in the netherlands ( in friesland ) , and north frisian and saterland frisian are recognized as regional languages in germany .
the ancient frisii enter recorded history in the roman account of drusus's *num* bc war against the rhine germans and the chauci .
they occasionally appear in the accounts of roman wars against the germanic tribes of the region , up to and including the revolt of the batavi around *num* ad .
frisian mercenaries were hired to assist the roman invasion of britain in the capacity of cavalry .
they are not mentioned again until *num* , when they were deported into roman territory as " laeti " ( i .
e .
, roman-era serfs ; see binchester roman fort and cuneus frisionum ) .
the discovery of a type of earthenware unique to *ord* century frisia , called " terp tritzum " , shows that an unknown number of them were resettled in flanders and kent , probably as " laeti " under roman coercion .
from the *ord* through the *ord* centuries frisia suffered marine transgressions that made most of the land uninhabitable , aggravated by a change to a cooler and wetter climate .
whatever population may have remained dropped dramatically , and the coastal lands remained largely unpopulated for the next two centuries .
when conditions improved , frisia received an influx of new settlers , mostly angles and saxons .
these people would eventually be referred to as ' frisians ' , though they were not necessarily descended from the ancient frisii .
it is these ' new frisians ' who are largely the ancestors of the medieval and modern frisians .
by the end of the *ord* century , frisian territory had expanded westward to the north sea coast and , in the *ord* century , southward down to dorestad .
this farthest extent of frisian territory is sometimes referred to as " frisia magna " .
early frisia was ruled by a high king , with the earliest reference to a ' frisian king ' being dated *num* .
in the early *ord* century the frisian nobles came into increasing conflict with the franks to their south , resulting in a series of wars in which the frankish empire eventually subjugated frisia in *num* .
these wars benefited attempts by anglo-irish missionaries ( which had begun with saint boniface ) to convert the frisian populace to christianity , in which saint willibrord largely succeeded .
some time after the death of charlemagne , the frisian territories were in theory under the control of the count of holland , but in practice the hollandic counts , starting with count arnulf in *num* , were unable to assert themselves as the sovereign lords of frisia .
the resulting stalemate resulted in a period of time called the ' frisian freedom ' , a period in which feudalism and serfdom ( as well as central or judicial administration ) did not exist , and in which the frisian lands only owed their allegiance to the holy roman emperor .
during the *ord* century , however , the counts of holland became increasingly powerful and , starting in *num* , sought to reassert themselves as rightful lords of the frisian lands in a series of wars , which ( with a series of lengthy interruptions ) ended in *num* with the hollandic conquest of western frisia and with the establishment of a more powerful noble class in central and eastern frisia .
in *num* , frisia became part of the seventeen provinces and in *num* joined the dutch revolt against philip ii , king of spain , heir of the burgundian territories ; central frisia has remained a part of the netherlands ever since .
the eastern periphery of frisia would become part of various german states ( later germany ) and denmark .
an old tradition existed in the region of exploitation of peatlands .
though impossible to know exact numbers and migration patterns , research has indicated that many frisians were part of the wave of ethnic groups to colonise areas of england alongside the anglo-saxons and jutes , starting from around the fifth century when frisians arrived along the coastline of kent .
studies have found the dna of people tested in central england to be " indistinguishable " from that of frisians .
frisians principally settled in modern-day kent , east anglia , the east midlands , north east england , and yorkshire .
across these areas , evidence of their settlement includes place names of frisian origin , such as frizinghall in bradford and frieston in lincolnshire .
similarities in dialect between great yarmouth and friesland have been noted , originating from trade between these areas during the middle ages .
frisians are also known to have founded the freston area of ipswich .
in scotland , historians have noted that colonies of angles and frisians settled as far north as the river forth .
this corresponds to those areas of scotland which historically constituted part of northumbria .
as both the anglo-saxons of england and the early frisians were formed from largely identical tribal confederacies , their respective languages were very similar .
old frisian is the most closely related language to old english and the modern frisian dialects are in turn the closest related languages to contemporary english , together forming the linguistic category of anglo-frisian .
the frisian language group itself is divided into three mutually unintelligible languages : of these three languages both saterland frisian ( *num* , *num* speakers ) and north frisian ( *num* , *num* speakers ) are endangered .
west frisian is spoken by around *num* , *num* native speakers and is not threatened .
today there exists a tripartite division of the frisians , into north frisians , east frisians and west frisians , caused by frisia's constant loss of territory in the middle ages .
the west frisians , in general , do not necessarily see themselves as part of a larger group of frisians , and , according to a *num* poll , identify themselves more with the dutch than with the east or north frisians .
therefore , the term ' frisian ' , when applied to the speakers of all three frisian languages , is a linguistic , ethnic and / or cultural concept , not a political one .
absalon absalon or axel ( *num* march *num* ) was a danish archbishop and statesman , who was the bishop of roskilde from *num* to *num* and archbishop of lund from *num* until his death .
he was the foremost politician and churchfather of denmark in the second half of the *ord* century , and was the closest advisor of king valdemar i of denmark .
he was a key figure in the danish policies of territorial expansion in the baltic sea , europeanization in close relationship with the holy see , and reform in the relation between the church and the public .
he combined the ideals of gregorian reform with loyal support of a strong monarchical power .
absalon was born into the powerful " hvide " clan , and owned great land possessions .
he endowed several church institutions , most prominently his family's sorø abbey .
he was granted lands by the crown , and built the first fortification of the city that evolved into modern-day copenhagen .
his titles were passed on to his nephews anders sunesen and peder sunesen .
he died in *num* , and was interred at sorø abbey .
absalon was born around *num* near sorø , zealand .
due to his name being unusual in denmark , it is speculated that he was christened on the danish " absalon " name day , october *num* .
he was the son of asser rig , a magnate of the " hvide " clan from fjenneslev on zealand , and inger eriksdotter .
he was also a kinsman of archbishop eskil of lund .
he grew up at the castle of his father , and was brought up alongside his older brother esbern snare and the young prince valdemar , who later became king valdemar i of denmark .
during the civil war following the death of eric iii of denmark in *num* , absalon travelled abroad to study theology in paris , while esbern fought for valdemar's ascension to the throne .
at paris , he was influenced by the gregorian reform ideals of churchly independence from monarchical rule .
he also befriended the canon william of æbelholt at the abbey of st genevieve , whom he later made abbott of eskilsø abbey .
absalon first appears in saxo grammaticus's contemporary chronicle " gesta danorum " at the end of the civil war , at the brokering of the peace agreement between sweyn iii and valdemar at st .
alban's priory , odense .
he was a guest at the following roskilde banquet given in *num* by sweyn to his rivals canute v and valdemar .
both absalon and valdemar narrowly escaped assassination at the hands of sweyn on this occasion , and escaped to jutland , whither sweyn followed them .
absalon probably did not take part in the following battle of grathe heath in *num* , in which sweyn was defeated and slain , which led to valdemar ascending to the danish throne .
on good friday *num* , bishop asser of roskilde died , and absalon was eventually elected bishop of roskilde on zealand with the help of valdemar , as the king's reward for the " hvide " family support .
absalon was a close counsellor of valdemar , and chief promoter of the danish crusades against the wends .
during the danish civil war , denmark had been open to coastal raids by the wends .
it was absalon's intention to clear the baltic sea of the wendish pirates who inhabited its southern littoral zone which was later called pomerania .
the pirates had raided the danish coasts during the civil war of sweyn iii , canute v , and valdemar , to the point where at the accession of valdemar one-third of denmark lay wasted and depopulated .
absalon formed a guardian fleet , built coastal defenses , and led several campaigns against the wends .
he even advocated forgiving the earlier enemies of valdemar , which helped stabilize denmark internally .
the first expedition against the wends , that was conducted by absalon in person , set out in *num* .
these expeditions were successful , but brought no lasting victories .
what started out as mere retribution , eventually evolved into full-fledged campaigns of expansion with religious motives .
in *num* began twenty years of crusades against the wends , sometimes with the help of german duke henry the lion , sometimes in opposition to him .
in *num* the chief wendish fortress at arkona in rügen , containing the sanctuary of their god svantevit , was conquered .
the wends agreed to accept danish suzerainty and the christian religion at the same time .
from arkona , absalon proceeded by sea to charenza , in the midst of rügen , the political capital of the wends and an all but impregnable stronghold .
but the unexpected fall of arkona had terrified the garrison , which surrendered unconditionally at the first appearance of the danish ships .
absalon , with only bishop sweyn of aarhus and twelve " housecarls " , thereupon disembarked , passed between a double row of wendish warriors , *num* strong , along the narrow path winding among the morasses , to the gates of the fortress , and , proceeding to the temple of the seven-headed god rugievit , caused the idol to be hewn down , dragged forth and burnt .
the whole population of garz was then baptized , and absalon laid the foundations of twelve churches in the isle of rügen .
rügen was then subjected to absalon's bishopric of roskilde .
the destruction of this chief sally-port of the wendish pirates enabled absalon considerably to reduce the danish fleet .
but he continued to keep a watchful eye over the baltic , and in *num* destroyed another pirate stronghold , farther eastward , at dziwnów on the isle of wolin .
absalon's last military exploit came in *num* , off stralsund at whitsun , when he soundly defeated a pomeranian fleet that had attacked denmark's vassal , jaromar of rügen .
absalon's main political goal was to free denmark from entanglements with the holy roman empire .
absalon reformed the danish church organisation to closer match holy see praxis , and worked to keep denmark a close ally of the holy see .
however , during the schism between pope alexander iii and antipope victor iv , absalon stayed loyal to valdemar even as he joined the holy roman emperor frederick barbarossa in supporting victor iv .
this caused a split within the danish church , as it possibly forced eskil into exile around *num* , despite abaslon's attempts to keep the danish church united .
it was contrary to absalon's advice and warnings that valdemar i rendered fealty to the emperor frederick barbarossa at dole in *num* .
when valdemar returned to denmark , he was convinced into strengthening the danevirke fortifications at the german border , with the support of absalon .
absalon built churches and monasteries , supporting international religious orders like the cistercians and augustinians , founding schools and doing his utmost to promote civilization and enlightenment .
in *num* , absalon transformed the sorø abbey of his family from benedictine to cistercian , granting it lands from his personal holdings .
in *num* , absalon was granted the land around the city of " havn " ( english : harbour ) , and built there a castle in the coastal defense against the wends .
havn quickly expanded as one of scandinavia's most important centers of trade , and eventually evolved into modern-day copenhagen .
it was also absalon who held the first danish synod at lund in *num* .
he was also interested in history and culture , and commissioned saxo grammaticus to write " gesta danorum " , a comprehensive chronicle of the history of the danes .
in *num* , absalon issued the " zealand church law " ( ) , which reduced the number of canonical law offenses for which the church could fine the public , while instituting the tithe payment system .
violation of the law was specified as subject to a secular legal process .
archbishop eskil returned from exile in *num* .
eskil agreed on canonizing valdemar's father knud lavard in *num* , with absalon assisting him at the feast .
when eskil stepped down as archbishop of lund in *num* , he chose absalon as his successor .
absalon initially resisted the new position , as he did not want to lose his power position on zealand , but complied with papal orders to do so in *num* .
by a unique papal dispensation , absalon was allowed to simultaneously maintain his post as bishop of roskilde .
as the archbishop of lund , absalon utilized ombudsmen from zealand , demanded unfree labour from the peasantry , and instituted tithes .
he was a harsh and effective ruler , who cleared all orthodox christian liturgical remnants in favour of papal standards .
a rebellion in the scanian peasantry forced him to flee to zealand in *num* , from where he returned and subdued the scanians with the help of valdemar .
when valdemar died in *num* , his son succeeded him as canute vi , and absalon served as canute vi's counsellor .
under canute vi , absalon was the chief policymaker in danish politics .
absalon kept his hostile attitude to the holy roman empire .
on the accession of canute vi in *num* , an imperial ambassador arrived at roskilde to get the new king to swear fealty to frederick barbarossa , but absalon resolutely withstood him .
when absalon retired from military service in *num* at the age of fifty-seven , he resigned the command of fleets and armies to younger men , like duke valdemar , the later king valdemar ii .
he instead confined himself to the administration of the danish empire .
in *num* , absalon made his nephew peder sunesen his successor as bishop of roskilde , while his other nephew anders sunesen was named the chancellor of canute vi .
absalon died at sorø abbey on march *num* , *num* , *num* years old , with his last will granting his personal holdings to the abbey , apart from fjenneslev which went to esbern snarre .
he had already given copenhagen to the bishopric of roskilde .
absalon was interred at sorø abbey , and was succeeded as archbishop of lund by anders sunesen .
saxo grammaticus ' " gesta danorum " was not finished until after the death of absalon , but absalon was one of the chief heroic figures of the chronicle , which was to be the main source of knowledge about early danish history .
absalon left a legacy as the foremost politician and churchfather of denmark in the *ord* century .
absalon was equally great as churchman , statesman , and warrior .
his policy of expansion was to give denmark the dominion of the baltic for three generations .
that he enjoyed warfare there can be no doubt ; yet he was not like the ordinary fighting bishops of the middle ages , whose sole indication of their religious role was to avoid the " shedding of blood " by using a mace in battle instead of a sword .
absalon never neglected his ecclesiastical duties .
in the 2000s , " absalon " was adopted as the name for a class of royal danish navy vessels , and the lead vessel of the class .
hdms absalon ( l16 ) and " esbern snare " ( l17 ) were launched and commissioned by denmark in *num* and *num* .
khmer language khmer or cambodian ( natively " phiəsaa khmae " , dialectal " khmæ " or " khmɛɛr " , or more formally " kheemaʾraʾ phiəsaa " ) is the language of the khmer people and the official language of cambodia .
with approximately *num* million speakers , it is the second most widely spoken austroasiatic language ( after vietnamese ) .
khmer has been influenced considerably by sanskrit and pali , especially in the royal and religious registers , through hinduism and buddhism .
the more colloquial registers have influenced , and have been influenced by , thai , lao , vietnamese , and cham , all of which , due to geographical proximity and long-term cultural contact , form a sprachbund in peninsular southeast asia .
it is also the earliest recorded and earliest written language of the mon–khmer family , predating mon and by a significant margin vietnamese , due to old khmer being the language of the historical empires of chenla , angkor and , presumably , their earlier predecessor state , funan .
the vast majority of khmer speakers speak central khmer , the dialect of the central plain where the khmer are most heavily concentrated .
within cambodia , regional accents exist in remote areas but these are regarded as varieties of central khmer .
two exceptions are the speech of the capital , phnom penh , and that of the khmer khe in stung treng province , both of which differ sufficiently enough from central khmer to be considered separate dialects of khmer .
outside of cambodia , three distinct dialects are spoken by ethnic khmers native to areas that were historically part of the khmer empire .
the northern khmer dialect is spoken by over a million khmers in the southern regions of northeast thailand and is treated by some linguists as a separate language .
khmer krom , or southern khmer , is the first language of the khmer of vietnam while the khmer living in the remote cardamom mountains speak a very conservative dialect that still displays features of the middle khmer language .
khmer is primarily an analytic , isolating language .
there are no inflections , conjugations or case endings .
instead , particles and auxiliary words are used to indicate grammatical relationships .
general word order is subject–verb–object , and modifiers follow the word they modify .
classifiers appear after numbers when used to count nouns , though not always so consistently as in languages like chinese .
in spoken khmer , topic-comment structure is common and the perceived social relation between participants determines which sets of vocabulary , such as pronouns and honorifics , are proper .
khmer differs from neighboring languages such as thai , burmese , lao and vietnamese in that it is not a tonal language .
words are stressed on the final syllable , hence many words conform to the typical mon–khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a minor syllable .
the language has been written in the khmer script , an abugida descended from the brahmi script via the southern indian pallava script , since at least the seventh century .
the script's form and use has evolved over the centuries ; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write clusters and a division of consonants into two series with different inherent vowels .
approximately *num* % of cambodians are able to read khmer .
khmer is a member of the austroasiatic language family , the autochthonous family in an area that stretches from the malay peninsula through southeast asia to east india .
austroasiatic , which also includes mon , vietnamese and munda , has been studied since *num* and was first proposed as a language family in *num* .
despite the amount of research , there is still doubt about the internal relationship of the languages of austroasiatic .
diffloth places khmer in an eastern branch of the mon-khmer languages .
in these classification schemes khmer's closest genetic relatives are the bahnaric and pearic languages .
more recent classifications doubt the validity of the mon-khmer sub-grouping and place the khmer language as its own branch of austroasiatic equidistant from the other *num* branches of the family .
khmer is spoken by some *num* million people in cambodia , where it is the official language .
it is also a second language for most of the minority groups and indigenous hill tribes there .
additionally there are a million speakers of khmer native to southern vietnam ( *num* census ) and *num* .
*num* million in northeast thailand ( *num* ) .
khmer dialects , although mutually intelligible , are sometimes quite marked .
notable variations are found in speakers from phnom penh ( cambodia's capital city ) , the rural battambang area , the areas of northeast thailand adjacent to cambodia such as surin province , the cardamom mountains , and southern vietnam .
the dialects form a continuum running roughly north to south .
standard cambodian khmer is mutually intelligible with the others but a khmer krom speaker from vietnam , for instance , may have great difficulty communicating with a khmer native of sisaket province in thailand .
the following is a classification scheme showing the development of the modern khmer dialects .
standard khmer , or central khmer , the language as taught in cambodian schools and used by the media , is based on the dialect spoken throughout the central plain , a region encompassed by the northwest and central provinces .
northern khmer ( called " khmer surin " in khmer ) refers to the dialects spoken by many in several border provinces of present-day northeast thailand .
after the fall of the khmer empire in the early *ord* century , the dongrek mountains served as a natural border leaving the khmer north of the mountains under the sphere of influence of the kingdom of lan xang .
the conquests of cambodia by naresuan the great for ayutthaya furthered their political and economic isolation from cambodia proper , leading to a dialect that developed relatively independently from the midpoint of the middle khmer period .
this has resulted in a distinct accent influenced by the surrounding tonal languages lao and thai , lexical differences , and phonemic differences in both vowels and distribution of consonants .
syllable-final , which has become silent in other dialects of khmer , is still pronounced in northern khmer .
some linguists classify northern khmer as a separate but closely related language rather than a dialect .
western khmer , also called cardamom khmer or chanthaburi khmer , is spoken by a very small , isolated population in the cardamom mountain range extending from western cambodia into eastern central thailand .
although little studied , this variety is unique in that it maintains a definite system of vocal register that has all but disappeared in other dialects of modern khmer .
phnom penh khmer is spoken in the capital and surrounding areas .
this dialect is characterized by merging or complete elision of syllables , which speakers from other regions consider a " relaxed " pronunciation .
for instance , " phnom penh " is sometimes be shortened to " m'penh " .
another characteristic of phnom penh speech is observed in words with an " r " either as an initial consonant or as the second member of a consonant cluster ( as in the english word " bread " ) .
the " r " , trilled or flapped in other dialects , is either pronounced as a uvular trill or not pronounced at all .
this alters the quality of any preceding consonant , causing a harder , more emphasized pronunciation .
another unique result is that the syllable is spoken with a low-rising or " dipping " tone much like the " hỏi " tone in vietnamese .
for example , some people pronounce ( ' fish ' ) as : the is dropped and the vowel begins by dipping much lower in tone than standard speech and then rises , effectively doubling its length .
another example is the word ( ' study ' ) , which is pronounced , with the uvular " r " and the same intonation described above .
khmer krom or southern khmer is spoken by the indigenous khmer population of the mekong delta , formerly controlled by the khmer empire but part of vietnam since *num* .
khmers are persecuted by the vietnamese government for using their native language and , since the 1950s , have been forced to take vietnamese names .
consequently , very little research has been published regarding this dialect .
it has been generally influenced by vietnamese for three centuries and accordingly displays a pronounced accent , tendency toward monosyllablic words and lexical differences from standard khmer .
khmer khe is spoken in the se san , srepok and sekong river valleys of sesan and siem pang districts in stung treng province .
following the decline of angkor , the khmer abandoned their northern territories , which the lao then settled .
in the *ord* century , chey chetha xi led a khmer force into stung treng to retake the area .
the khmer khe living in this area of stung treng in modern times are presumed to be the descendants of this group .
their dialect is thought to resemble that of pre-modern siem reap .
linguistic study of the khmer language divides its history into four periods one of which , the old khmer period , is subdivided into pre-angkorian and angkorian .
pre-angkorian khmer , the old khmer language from *num* ce through *num* , is only known from words and phrases in sanskrit texts of the era .
old khmer ( or angkorian khmer ) is the language as it was spoken in the khmer empire from the *ord* century until the weakening of the empire sometime in the *ord* century .
old khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars , most notably saveros pou , phillip jenner and heinz-jürgen pinnow .
following the end of the khmer empire the language lost the standardizing influence of being the language of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in morphology , phonology and lexicon .
the language of this transition period , from about the *ord* to *ord* centuries , is referred to as middle khmer and saw borrowing from thai , lao and , to a lesser extent , vietnamese .
the changes during this period are so profound that the rules of modern khmer can not be applied to correctly understand old khmer .
the language became recognizable as modern khmer , spoken from the *ord* century till today .
the following table shows the conventionally accepted historical stages of khmer .
just as modern khmer was emerging from the transitional period represented by middle khmer , cambodia fell under the influence of french colonialism .
thailand , which had for centuries claimed suzerainty over cambodia and controlled succession to the cambodian throne , began losing its influence on the language .
in *num* cambodia was fully integrated into french indochina , which brought in a french-speaking aristocracy .
this led to french becoming the language of higher education and the intellectual class .
by *num* , the french had wrested over half of modern-day cambodia , including the north and northwest where thai had been the prestige language , back from thai control and reintegrated it into the country .
many native scholars in the early *ord* century , led by a monk named chuon nath , resisted the french and thai influences on their language .
forming the government sponsored cultural committee to define and standardize the modern language , they championed khmerization , purging of foreign elements , reviving affixation , and the use of old khmer roots and historical pali and sanskrit to coin new words for modern ideas .
opponents , led by keng vannsak , who embraced " total khmerization " by denouncing the reversion to classical languages and favoring the use of contemporary colloquial khmer for neologisms , and ieu koeus , who favored borrowing from thai , were also influential .
koeus later joined the cultural committee and supported nath .
nath's views and prolific work won out and he is credited with cultivating modern khmer-language identity and culture , overseeing the translation of the entire pali buddhist canon into khmer .
he also created the modern khmer language dictionary that is still in use today , thereby ensuring that khmer would survive , and indeed flourish , during the french colonial period .
the phonological system described here is the inventory of sounds of the standard spoken language , represented using appropriate symbols from the international phonetic alphabet ( ipa ) .
the voiceless plosives may occur with or without aspiration ( as vs .
, etc .
) ; this difference is contrastive before a vowel .
however , the aspirated sounds in that position may be analyzed as sequences of two phonemes : .
this analysis is supported by the fact that infixes can be inserted between the stop and the aspiration ; for example ( ' big ' ) becomes ( ' size ' ) with a nominalizing infix .
when one of these plosives occurs initially before another consonant , aspiration is no longer contrastive and can be regarded as mere phonetic detail : slight aspiration is expected when the following consonant is not one of ( or if the initial plosive is ) .
the voiced plosives are pronounced as implosives by most speakers , but this feature is weak in educated speech , where they become .
in syllable-final position , and approach and respectively .
the stops are unaspirated and have no audible release when occurring as syllable finals .
in addition , the consonants , , and occur occasionally in recent loan words in the speech of cambodians familiar with french and other languages .
various authors have proposed slightly different analyses of the khmer vowel system .
this may be in part because of the wide degree of variation in pronunciation between individual speakers , even within a dialectal region .
the description below follows huffman ( *num* ) .
the number of vowel nuclei and their values vary between dialects ; differences exist even between the standard khmer system and that of the battambang dialect on which the standard is based .
in addition , some diphthongs and triphthongs are analyzed as a vowel nucleus plus a semivowel ( or ) coda because they can not be followed by a final consonant .
these include : ( with short monophthongs ) , , , , ; ( with long monophthongs ) , ; ( with long diphthongs ) , , , , and .
a khmer syllable begins with a single consonant , or else with a cluster of two , or rarely three , consonants .
the only possible clusters of three consonants at the start of a syllable are , and ( with aspirated consonants analyzed as two-consonant sequences ) .
there are *num* possible two-consonant clusters ( including [ pʰ ] etc .
analyzed as / ph / etc .
) .
all the clusters are shown in the following table , phonetically , i .
e .
superscript ʰ can mark either contrastive or non-contrastive aspiration ( see above ) .
slight vowel epenthesis occurs in the clusters consisting of a plosive followed by , in those beginning , and in the cluster .
after the initial consonant or consonant cluster comes the syllabic nucleus , which is one of the vowels listed above .
this vowel may end the syllable or may be followed by a coda , which is a single consonant .
if the syllable is stressed and the vowel is short , there must be a final consonant .
all consonant sounds except and the aspirates can appear as the coda ( although final / r / is heard in some dialects , most notably in northern khmer ) .
a minor syllable ( unstressed syllable preceding the main syllable of a word ) has a structure of cv- , crv- , cvn- or crvn- ( where c is a consonant , v a vowel , and n a nasal consonant ) .
the vowels in such syllables are usually short ; in conversation they may be reduced to , although in careful or formal speech , including on television and radio , they are clearly articulated .
an example of such a word is " mɔnuh , mɔnɨh , mĕəʾnuh " ( ' person ' ) , pronounced , or more casually .
stress in khmer falls on the final syllable of a word .
because of this predictable pattern , stress is non-phonemic in khmer ( it does not distinguish different meanings ) .
most khmer words consist of either one or two syllables .
in most native disyllabic words , the first syllable is a minor ( fully unstressed ) syllable .
such words have been described as " sesquisyllabic " ( i .
e .
as having one-and-a-half syllables ) .
there are also some disyllabic words in which the first syllable does not behave as a minor syllable , but takes secondary stress .
most such words are compounds , but some are single morphemes ( generally loanwords ) .
an example is ( ' language ' ) , pronounced .
words with three or more syllables , if they are not compounds , are mostly loanwords , usually derived from pali , sanskrit , or more recently , french .
they are nonetheless adapted to khmer stress patterns .
primary stress falls on the final syllable , with secondary stress on every second syllable from the end .
thus in a three-syllable word , the first syllable has secondary stress ; in a four-syllable word , the second syllable has secondary stress ; in a five-syllable word , the first and third syllables have secondary stress , and so on .
long polysyllables are not often used in conversation .
compounds , however , preserve the stress patterns of the constituent words .
thus , the name of a kind of cookie ( literally ' bird's nest ' ) , is pronounced , with secondary stress on the second rather than the first syllable , because it is composed of the words ( ' nest ' ) and ( ' bird ' ) .
khmer once had a phonation distinction in its vowels , but this now survives only in the most archaic dialect ( western khmer ) .
the distinction arose historically when vowels after old khmer voiced consonants became breathy voiced and diphthongized ; for example became .
when consonant voicing was lost , the distinction was maintained by the vowel ( ) ; later the phonation disappeared as well ( ) .
these processes explain the origin of what are now called a-series and o-series consonants in the khmer script .
although most cambodian dialects are not tonal , colloquial phnom penh dialect has developed a tonal contrast ( level versus peaking tone ) as a by-product of the elision of .
intonation often conveys semantic context in khmer , as in distinguishing declarative statements , questions and exclamations .
the available grammatical means of making such distinctions are not always used , or may be ambiguous ; for example , the final interrogative particle can also serve as an emphasizing ( or in some cases negating ) particle .
the intonation pattern of a typical khmer declarative phrase is a steady rise throughout followed by an abrupt drop on the last syllable .
other intonation contours signify a different type of phrase such as the " full doubt " interrogative , similar to yes-no questions in english .
full doubt interrogatives remain fairly even in tone throughout , but rise sharply towards the end .
exclamatory phrases follow the typical steadily rising pattern , but rise sharply on the last syllable instead of falling .
khmer is primarily an analytic language with no inflection .
syntactic relations are mainly determined by word order .
old and middle khmer used particles to mark grammatical categories and many of these have survived in modern khmer but are used sparingly , mostly in literary or formal language .
khmer makes extensive use of auxiliary verbs , " directionals " and serial verb construction .
colloquial khmer is a zero copula language , instead preferring predicative adjectives ( and even predicative nouns ) unless using a copula for emphasis or to avoid ambiguity in more complex sentences .
basic word order is subject–verb–object ( svo ) , although subjects are often dropped ; prepositions are used rather than postpositions .
topic-comment constructions are common and the language is generally head-initial ( modifiers follow the words they modify ) .
some grammatical processes are still not fully understood by western scholars .
for example , it is not clear if certain features of khmer grammar , such as actor nominalization , should be treated as a morphological process or a purely syntactic device , and some derivational morphology seems " purely decorative " and performs no known syntactic work .
lexical categories have been hard to define in khmer .
henri maspero , an early scholar of khmer , claimed the language had no parts of speech , while a later scholar , judith jacob , posited four parts of speech and innumerable particles .
john haiman , on the other hand , identifies " a couple dozen " parts of speech in khmer with the caveat that khmer words have the freedom to perform a variety of syntactic functions depending on such factors as word order , relevant particles , location within a clause , intonation and context .
some of the more important lexical categories and their function are demonstrated in the following example sentence taken from a hospital brochure : modern khmer is an isolating language , which means that it uses little productive morphology .
there is some derivation by means of prefixes and infixes , but this is a remnant of old khmer and not always productive in the modern language .
khmer morphology is evidence of a historical process through which the language was , at some point in the past , changed from being an agglutinative language to adopting an isolating typology .
affixed forms are lexicalized and cannot be used productively to form new words .
below are some of the most common affixes with examples as given by huffman .
compounding in khmer is a common derivational process that takes two forms , coordinate compounds and repetitive compounds .
coordinate compounds join two unbound morphemes ( independent words ) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone .
coordinate compounds join either two nouns or two verbs .
repetitive compounds , one of the most productive derivational features of khmer , use reduplication of an entire word to derive words whose meaning depends on the class of the reduplicated word .
a repetitive compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean either an intensification or plurality .
coordinate compounds : repetitive compounds : khmer nouns do not inflect for grammatical gender or singular / plural .
there are no articles , but indefiniteness is often expressed by the word for " one " ( , ) following the noun as in ( " a dog " ) .
plurality can be marked by postnominal particles , numerals , or reduplication of a following adjective , which , although similar to intensification , is usually not ambiguous due to context .
classifying particles are used after numerals , but are not always obligatory as they are in thai or chinese , for example , and are often dropped in colloquial speech .
khmer nouns are divided into two groups : mass nouns , which take classifiers ; and specific , nouns , which do not .
the overwhelming majority are mass nouns .
possession is colloquially expressed by word order .
the possessor is placed after the thing that is possessed .
alternatively , in more complex sentences or when emphasis is required , a possessive construction using the word ( , " property , object " ) may be employed .
in formal and literary contexts , the possessive particle ( ) is used : pronouns are subject to a complicated system of social register , the choice of pronoun depending on the perceived relationships between speaker , audience and referent ( see social registers below ) .
kinship terms , nicknames and proper names are often used as pronouns ( including for the first person ) among intimates .
subject pronouns are frequently dropped in colloquial conversation .
adjectives , verbs and verb phrases may be made into nouns by the use of nominalization particles .
three of the more common particles used to create nouns are , , and .
these particles are prefixed most often to verbs to form abstract nouns .
the latter , derived from sanskrit , also occurs as a suffix in fixed forms borrowed from sanskrit and pali such as ( " health " ) from ( " to be healthy " ) .
adjectives , demonstratives and numerals follow the noun they modify .
adverbs likewise follow the verb .
morphologically , adjectives and adverbs are not distinguished , with many words often serving either function .
adjectives are also employed as verbs as khmer sentences rarely use a copula .
degrees of comparison are constructed syntactically .
comparatives are expressed using the word : " a x [ b ] " ( a is more x [ than b ] ) .
the most common way to express superlatives is with : " a x " ( a is the most x ) .
intensity is also expressed syntactically , similar to other languages of the region , by reduplication or with the use of intensifiers .
as is typical of most east asian languages , khmer verbs do not inflect at all ; tense , aspect and mood can be expressed using auxiliary verbs , particles ( such as , placed before a verb to express continuous aspect ) and adverbs ( such as " yesterday " , " earlier " , " tomorrow " ) , or may be understood from context .
serial verb construction is quite common .
khmer verbs are a relatively open class and can be divided into two types , main verbs and auxiliary verbs .
huffman defined a khmer verb as " any word that can be ( negated ) " , and further divided main verbs into three classes .
transitive verbs are verbs that may be followed by a direct object : intransitive verbs are verbs that can not be followed by an object : adjectival verbs are a word class that has no equivalent in english .
when modifying a noun or verb , they function as adjectives or adverbs , respectively , but they may also be used as main verbs equivalent to english " be + " adjective" " .
syntax is the rules and processes that describe how sentences are formed in a particular language , how words relate to each other within clauses or phrases and how those phrases relate to each other within a sentence to convey meaning .
khmer syntax is very analytic .
relationships between words and phrases are signified primarily by word order supplemented with auxiliary verbs and , particularly in formal and literary registers , grammatical marking particles .
grammatical phenomena such as negation and aspect are marked by particles while interrogative sentences are marked either by particles or interrogative words equivalent to english " wh-words " .
a complete khmer sentence consists of four basic elements—an optional topic , an optional subject , an obligatory predicate , and various adverbials and particles .
the topic and subject are noun phrases , predicates are verb phrases and another noun phrase acting as an object or verbal attribute often follows the predicate .
when combining these noun and verb phrases into a sentence the order is typically svo : when both a direct object and indirect object are present without any grammatical markers , the preferred order is sv ( do ) ( io ) .
in such a case , if the direct object phrase contains multiple components , the indirect object immediately follows the noun of the direct object phrase and the direct object's modifiers follow the indirect object : this ordering of objects can be changed and the meaning clarified with the inclusion of particles .
the word , which normally means " to arrive " or " towards " , can be used as a preposition meaning " to " : alternatively , the indirect object could precede the direct object if the object-marking preposition were used : however , in spoken discourse osv is possible when emphasizing the object in a topic–comment-like structure .
the noun phrase in khmer typically has the following structure : the elements in parentheses are optional .
honorifics are a class of words that serve to index the social status of the referent .
honorifics can be kinship terms or personal names , both of which are often used as first and second person pronouns , or specialized words such as ( ' god ' ) before royal and religious objects .
the most common demonstratives are ( ' this , these ' ) and ( ' that , those ' ) .
the word ( ' those over there ' ) has a more distal or vague connotation .
if the noun phrase contains a possessive adjective , it follows the noun and precedes the numeral .
if a descriptive attribute co-occurs with a possessive , the possessive construction ( ) is expected .
some examples of typical khmer noun phrases are : the khmer particle marked attributes in old khmer noun phrases and is used in formal and literary language to signify that what precedes is the noun and what follows is the attribute .
modern usage may carry the connotation of mild intensity .
khmer verbs are completely uninflected , and once a subject or topic has been introduced or is clear from context the noun phrase may be dropped .
thus , the simplest possible sentence in khmer consists of a single verb .
for example , ' to go ' on its own can mean " i'm going .
" , " he went .
" , " they've gone .
" , " let's go .
" , etc .
this also results in long strings of verbs such as : khmer uses three verbs for what translates into english as the copula .
the general copula is ; it is used to convey identity with nominal predicates .
for locative predicates , the copula is .
the verb is the " existential " copula meaning " there is " or " there exists " .
negation is achieved by putting before the verb and the particle at the end of the sentence or clause .
in colloquial speech , verbs can also be negated without the need for a final particle , by placing before them .
past tense can be conveyed by adverbs , such as " yesterday " or by the use of perfective particles such as different senses of future action can also be expressed by the use of adverbs like " tomorrow " or by the future tense marker , which is placed immediately before the verb , or both : imperatives are often unmarked .
for example , in addition to the meanings given above , the " sentence " can also mean " go ! " .
various words and particles may be added to the verb to soften the command to varying degrees , including to the point of politeness ( jussives ) : prohibitives take the form " + " and also are often softened by the addition of the particle to the end of the phrase .
there are three basic types of questions in khmer .
questions requesting specific information use question words .
polar questions are indicated with interrogative particles , most commonly , a homonym of the negation particle .
tag questions are indicated with various particles and rising inflection .
the svo word order is generally not inverted for questions .
in more formal contexts and in polite speech , questions are also marked at their beginning by the particle .
khmer does not have a passive voice , but there is a construction utilizing the main verb ( " to hit " , " to be correct " , " to affect " ) as an auxiliary verb meaning " to be subject to " or " to undergo"—which results in sentences that are translated to english using the passive voice .
complex sentences are formed in khmer by the addition of one or more clauses to the main clause .
the various types of clauses in khmer include the coordinate clause , the relative clause and the subordinate clause .
word order in clauses is the same for that of the basic sentences described above .
coordinate clauses do not necessarily have to be marked ; they can simply follow one another .
when explicitly marked , they are joined by words similar to english conjunctions such as ( " and " ) and ( " and then " ) or by clause-final conjunction-like adverbs and , both of which can mean " also " or " and also " ; disjunction is indicated by ( " or " ) .
relative clauses can be introduced by ( " that " ) but , similar to coordinate clauses , often simply follow the main clause .
for example , both phrases below can mean " the hospital bed that has wheels " .
relative clauses are more likely to be introduced with if they do not immediately follow the head noun .
khmer subordinate conjunctions always precede a subordinate clause .
subordinate conjunctions include words such as ( " because " ) , ( " seems as if " ) and ( " in order to " ) .
counting in khmer is based on a biquinary system ( the numbers from *num* to *num* have the form " five one " , " five two " , etc .
) however , the words for multiples of ten from *num* to *num* are not related to the basic khmer numbers , but are probably borrowed from thai .
khmer numerals , which were inherited from indian numerals , are used more widely than western arabic numerals .
the principal number words are listed in the following table , which gives western and khmer digits , khmer spelling and ipa transcription .
intermediate numbers are formed by compounding the above elements .
powers of ten are denoted by loan words : ( *num* ) , ( *num* , *num* ) , ( *num* , *num* ) , ( *num* , *num* ) and ( *num* , *num* , *num* ) from thai and ( *num* , *num* , *num* ) from sanskrit .
ordinal numbers are formed by placing the particle before the corresponding cardinal number .
khmer employs a system of registers in which the speaker must always be conscious of the social status of the person spoken to .
the different registers , which include those used for common speech , polite speech , speaking to or about royals and speaking to or about monks , employ alternate verbs , names of body parts and pronouns .
this results in what appears to foreigners as separate languages and , in fact , isolated villagers often are unsure how to speak with royals and royals raised completely within the court do not feel comfortable speaking the common register .
as an example , the word for " to eat " used between intimates or in reference to animals is .
used in polite reference to commoners , it is .
when used of those of higher social status , it is or .
for monks the word is and for royals , .
another result is that the pronominal system is complex and full of honorific variations , just a few of which are shown in the table below .
khmer is written with the khmer script , an abugida developed from the pallava script of india before the *ord* century when the first known inscription appeared .
written left-to-right with vowel signs that can be placed after , before , above or below the consonant they follow , the khmer script is similar in appearance and usage to thai and lao , both of which were based on the khmer system .
the khmer script is also distantly related to the mon script , the ancestor of the modern burmese script .
within cambodia , literacy in the khmer alphabet is estimated at *num* .
*num* % .
consonant symbols in khmer are divided into two groups , or series .
the first series carries the inherent vowel while the second series carries the inherent vowel .
the khmer names of the series , ( ' voiceless ' ) and ( ' voiced ' ) , respectively , indicate that the second series consonants were used to represent the voiced phonemes of old khmer .
as the voicing of stops was lost , however , the contrast shifted to the phonation of the attached vowels , which , in turn , evolved into a simple difference of vowel quality , often by diphthongization .
deep space *num* deep space *num* ( ds1 ) was a nasa technology demonstration spacecraft which flew by an asteroid and a comet .
it was part of the new millennium program , dedicated to testing advanced technologies .
launched on *num* october *num* , the " deep space *num* " spacecraft carried out a flyby of asteroid *num* braille , which was its primary science target .
the mission was extended twice to include an encounter with comet 19p / borrelly and further engineering testing .
problems during its initial stages and with its star tracker led to repeated changes in mission configuration .
while the flyby of the asteroid was only a partial success , the encounter with the comet retrieved valuable information .
three of twelve technologies on board had to work within a few minutes of separation from the carrier rocket for the mission to continue .
the deep space series was continued by the " deep space *num* " probes , which were launched in january *num* piggybacked on the mars polar lander and were intended to strike the surface of mars ( though contact was lost and the mission failed ) .
" deep space *num* " was the first nasa spacecraft to use ion propulsion rather than the traditional chemical-powered rockets .
the purpose of " deep space *num* " was technology development and validation for future missions ; *num* technologies were tested : the autonav system , developed by nasa's jet propulsion laboratory , takes images of known bright asteroids .
the asteroids in the inner solar system move in relation to other bodies at a noticeable , predictable speed .
thus a spacecraft can determine its relative position by tracking such asteroids across the star background , which appears fixed over such timescales .
two or more asteroids let the spacecraft triangulate its position ; two or more positions in time let the spacecraft determine its trajectory .
existing spacecraft are tracked by their interactions with the transmitters of the nasa deep space network ( dsn ) , in effect an inverse gps .
however , dsn tracking requires many skilled operators , and the dsn is overburdened by its use as a communications network .
the use of autonav reduces mission cost and dsn demands .
the autonav system can also be used in reverse , tracking the position of bodies relative to the spacecraft .
this is used to acquire targets for the scientific instruments .
the spacecraft is programmed with the target's coarse location .
after initial acquisition , autonav keeps the subject in frame , even commandeering the spacecraft's attitude control .
the next spacecraft to use autonav was " deep impact " .
primary power for the mission was produced by a new solar array technology , the solar concentrator array with refractive linear element technology ( scarlet ) , which uses linear fresnel lenses made of silicone to concentrate sunlight onto solar cells .
able engineering developed the concentrator technology and built the solar array for ds1 , with entech inc , who supplied the fresnel optics , and the nasa glenn research center .
the activity was sponsored by the ballistic missile defense organization .
the concentrating lens technology was combined with dual-junction solar cells , which had considerably better performance than the gaas solar cells that were the state of the art at the time of the mission launch .
the scarlet arrays generated *num* .
*num* kilowatts at *num* au , with less size and weight than conventional arrays .
although ion engines had been developed at nasa since the late 1950s , with the exception of the sert missions in the 1960s , the technology had not been demonstrated in flight on united states spacecraft , though hundreds of hall-effect engines had been used on soviet and russian spacecraft .
this lack of a performance history in space meant that despite the potential savings in propellant mass , the technology was considered too experimental to be used for high-cost missions .
furthermore , unforeseen side effects of ion propulsion might in some way interfere with typical scientific experiments , such as fields and particle measurements .
therefore , it was a primary mission of the " deep space *num* " demonstration to show long-duration use of an ion thruster on a scientific mission .
the nasa solar technology application readiness ( nstar ) electrostatic ion thruster , developed at nasa glenn , achieves a specific impulse of 1000–3000 seconds .
this is an order of magnitude higher than traditional space propulsion methods , resulting in a mass savings of approximately half .
this leads to much cheaper launch vehicles .
although the engine produces just thrust at maximal power ( *num* , *num* w on ds1 ) , the craft achieved high speeds because ion engines thrust continuously for long periods .
the next spacecraft to use nstar engines was " dawn " , with three redundant units .
remote agent ( rax ) , remote intelligent self-repair software developed at nasa's ames research center and the jet propulsion laboratory , was the first artificial-intelligence control system to control a spacecraft without human supervision .
remote agent successfully demonstrated the ability to plan onboard activities and correctly diagnose and respond to simulated faults in spacecraft components through its built-in repl environment .
autonomous control will enable future spacecraft to operate at greater distances from earth and to carry out more sophisticated science-gathering activities in deep space .
components of the remote agent software have been used to support other nasa missions .
major components of remote agent were a robust planner ( europa ) , a plan-execution system ( exec ) and a model-based diagnostic system ( livingstone ) .
europa was used as a ground-based planner for the mars exploration rovers .
europa ii was used to support the " phoenix " mars lander and the mars science laboratory .
livingstone2 was flown as an experiment aboard earth observing-1 and on an f / a-18 hornet at nasa's dryden flight research center .
another method for reducing dsn burdens is the beacon monitor experiment .
during the long cruise periods of the mission , spacecraft operations are essentially suspended .
instead of data , the craft emits a carrier signal on a predetermined frequency .
without data decoding , the carrier can be detected by much simpler ground antennas and receivers .
if the spacecraft detects an anomaly , it changes the carrier between four tones , based on urgency .
ground receivers then signal operators to divert dsn resources .
this prevents skilled operators and expensive hardware from babysitting an unburdened mission operating nominally .
a similar system is used on the " new horizons " pluto probe to keep costs down during its ten-year cruise from jupiter to pluto .
the small deep space transponder ( sdst ) is a compact and lightweight radio-communications system .
aside from using miniaturized components , the sdst is capable of communicating over the k band .
because this band is higher in frequency than bands currently in use by deep-space missions , the same amount of data can be sent by smaller equipment in space and on the ground .
conversely , existing dsn antennas can split time among more missions .
at the time of launch , the dsn had a small number of k receivers installed on an experimental basis ; k operations and missions are increasing .
the sdst was later used on other space missions such as the mars science laboratory ( the mars rover " curiosity " ) .
once at a target , ds1 senses the particle environment with the pepe ( plasma experiment for planetary exploration ) instrument .
this instrument measured the flux of ions and electrons as a function of their energy and direction .
the composition of the ions was determined by using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer .
the micas ( miniature integrated camera and spectrometer ) instrument combined visible light imaging with infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopy to determine chemical composition .
all channels share a telescope , which uses a silicon carbide mirror .
both pepe and micas were similar in capabilities to larger instruments or suites of instruments on other spacecraft .
they were designed to be smaller and require lower power than those used on previous missions .
prior to launch , " deep space *num* " was intended to visit comet 76p / west–kohoutek–ikemura and asteroid *num* mcauliffe .
because of the delayed launch , the targets were changed to asteroid *num* braille ( at the time called *num* kd ) and comet 107p / wilson–harrington .
it achieved an impaired flyby of braille and , due to problems with the star tracker , was re-tasked to fly by comet 19p / borrelly , which was successful .
an august *num* flyby of asteroid as another extended mission was considered , but ultimately was not advanced due to cost concerns .
during the mission , high quality infrared spectra of mars were also taken .
the ion propulsion engine initially failed after *num* .
*num* minutes of operation .
however , it was later restored to action and performed excellently .
early in the mission , material ejected during launch vehicle separation caused the closely spaced ion extraction grids to short-circuit .
the contamination was eventually cleared , as the material was eroded by electrical arcing , sublimed by outgassing , or simply allowed to drift out .
this was achieved by repeatedly restarting the engine in an engine repair mode , arcing across trapped material .
it was thought that the ion engine exhaust might interfere with other spacecraft systems , such as radio communications or the science instruments .
the pepe detectors had a secondary function to monitor such effects from the engine .
no interference was found .
another failure was the loss of the star tracker .
the star tracker determines spacecraft orientation by comparing the star field to its internal charts .
the mission was saved when the micas camera was reprogrammed to substitute for the star tracker .
although micas is more sensitive , its field-of-view is an order of magnitude smaller , creating a greater information processing burden .
ironically , the star tracker was an off-the-shelf component , expected to be highly reliable .
without a working star tracker , ion thrusting was temporarily suspended .
the loss of thrust time forced the cancellation of a flyby past comet 107p / wilson–harrington .
the autonav system required occasional manual corrections .
most problems were in identifying objects that were too dim , or were difficult to identify because of brighter objects causing diffraction spikes and reflections in the camera , causing autonav to misidentify targets .
the remote agent system was presented with three simulated failures on the spacecraft and correctly handled each event .
overall this constituted a successful demonstration of fully autonomous planning , diagnosis , and recovery .
the micas instrument was a design success , but the ultraviolet channel failed due to an electrical fault .
later in the mission , after the star tracker failure , micas assumed this duty as well .
this caused continual interruptions in its scientific use during the remaining mission , including the comet borrelly encounter .
the flyby of the asteroid *num* braille was only a partial success .
" deep space *num* " was intended to perform the flyby at at only from the asteroid .
due to technical difficulties , including a software crash shortly before approach , the craft instead passed braille at a distance of .
this , plus braille's lower albedo , meant that the asteroid was not bright enough for the autonav to focus the camera in the right direction , and the picture shoot was delayed by almost an hour .
the resulting pictures were disappointingly indistinct .
however , the flyby of comet borrelly was a great success and returned extremely detailed images of the comet's surface .
such images were of higher resolution than the only previous pictures , of halley's comet taken by the " giotto " spacecraft .
the pepe instrument reported that the comet's fields were offset from the nucleus .
this is believed to be due to emission of jets , which were not distributed evenly across the comet's surface .
despite having no debris shields , the spacecraft survived the comet passage intact .
once again , the sparse comet jets did not appear to point towards the spacecraft .
" deep space *num* " then entered its second extended mission phase , focused on retesting the spacecraft's hardware technologies .
the focus of this mission phase was on the ion engine systems .
the spacecraft eventually ran out of hydrazine fuel for its attitude control thrusters .
the highly efficient ion thruster had a sufficient amount of propellant left to perform attitude control in addition to main propulsion , thus allowing the mission to continue .
during late october and early november *num* , during the spacecraft's post-braille encounter coast phase , " deep space *num* " observed mars with its micas instrument .
although this was a very distant flyby , the instrument did succeed in taking multiple infrared spectra of the planet .
"deep space *num* " succeeded in its primary and secondary objectives , returning valuable science data and images .
ds1's ion engines were shut down on *num* december *num* at approximately *num* : *num* : *num* utc , signaling the end of the mission .
on-board communications were commanded to remain active in case the craft is needed in the future .
however , attempts to resume contact in march *num* were unsuccessful .
it remains within the solar system , orbiting the sun .
cognitive science cognitive science is the interdisciplinary , scientific study of the mind and its processes .
it examines the nature , the tasks , and the functions of cognition ( in a broad sense ) .
cognitive scientists study intelligence and behavior , with a focus on how nervous systems represent , process , and transform information .
mental faculties of concern to cognitive scientists include language , perception , memory , attention , reasoning , and emotion ; to understand these faculties , cognitive scientists borrow from fields such as linguistics , psychology , artificial intelligence , philosophy , neuroscience , and anthropology .
the typical analysis of cognitive science spans many levels of organization , from learning and decision to logic and planning ; from neural circuitry to modular brain organization .
the fundamental concept of cognitive science is that " thinking can best be understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures .
" simply put : cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of cognition in humans , animals , and machines .
it encompasses the traditional disciplines of psychology , computer science , neuroscience , anthropology , linguistics and philosophy .
the goal of cognitive science is to understand the principles of intelligence with the hope that this will lead to better comprehension of the mind and of learning and to develop intelligent devices .
the cognitive sciences began as an intellectual movement in the 1950s often referred to as the cognitive revolution .
a central tenet of cognitive science is that a complete understanding of the mind / brain cannot be attained by studying only a single level .
an example would be the problem of remembering a phone number and recalling it later .
one approach to understanding this process would be to study behavior through direct observation , or naturalistic observation .
a person could be presented with a phone number and be asked to recall it after some delay of time ; then the accuracy of the response could be measured .
another approach to measure cognitive ability would be to study the firings of individual neurons while a person is trying to remember the phone number .
neither of these experiments on its own would fully explain how the process of remembering a phone number works .
even if the technology to map out every neuron in the brain in real-time were available and it were known when each neuron fired it would still be impossible to know how a particular firing of neurons translates into the observed behavior .
thus an understanding of how these two levels relate to each other is imperative .
" the embodied mind : cognitive science and human experience " says “the new sciences of the mind need to enlarge their horizon to encompass , both , lived human experience and the possibilities for transformation inherent in human experience .
” this can be provided by a functional level account of the process .
studying a particular phenomenon from multiple levels creates a better understanding of the processes that occur in the brain to give rise to a particular behavior .
marr gave a famous description of three levels of analysis : cognitive science is an interdisciplinary field with contributors from various fields , including psychology , neuroscience , linguistics , philosophy of mind , computer science , anthropology and biology .
cognitive scientists work collectively in hope of understanding the mind and its interactions with the surrounding world much like other sciences do .
the field regards itself as compatible with the physical sciences and uses the scientific method as well as simulation or modeling , often comparing the output of models with aspects of human cognition .
similarly to the field of psychology , there is some doubt whether there is a unified cognitive science , which have led some researchers to prefer ' cognitive sciences ' in plural .
many , but not all , who consider themselves cognitive scientists hold a functionalist view of the mind—the view that mental states and processes should be explained by their function - what they do .
according to the multiple realizability account of functionalism , even non-human systems such as robots and computers can be ascribed as having cognition .
the term " cognitive " in " cognitive science " is used for " any kind of mental operation or structure that can be studied in precise terms " ( lakoff and johnson , *num* ) .
this conceptualization is very broad , and should not be confused with how " cognitive " is used in some traditions of analytic philosophy , where " cognitive " has to do only with formal rules and truth conditional semantics .
the earliest entries for the word " "cognitive" " in the oed take it to mean roughly " "pertaining to the action or process of knowing" " .
the first entry , from *num* , shows the word was at one time used in the context of discussions of platonic theories of knowledge .
most in cognitive science , however , presumably do not believe their field is the study of anything as certain as the knowledge sought by plato .
cognitive science is a large field , and covers a wide array of topics on cognition .
however , it should be recognized that cognitive science has not always been equally concerned with every topic that might bear relevance to the nature and operation of minds .
among philosophers , classical cognitivists have largely de-emphasized or avoided social and cultural factors , emotion , consciousness , animal cognition , and comparative and evolutionary psychologies .
however , with the decline of behaviorism , internal states such as affects and emotions , as well as awareness and covert attention became approachable again .
for example , situated and embodied cognition theories take into account the current state of the environment as well as the role of the body in cognition .
with the newfound emphasis on information processing , observable behavior was no longer the hallmark of psychological theory , but the modeling or recording of mental states .
below are some of the main topics that cognitive science is concerned with .
this is not an exhaustive list .
see list of cognitive science topics for a list of various aspects of the field .
artificial intelligence ( ai ) involves the study of cognitive phenomena in machines .
one of the practical goals of ai is to implement aspects of human intelligence in computers .
computers are also widely used as a tool with which to study cognitive phenomena .
computational modeling uses simulations to study how human intelligence may be structured .
( see .
) there is some debate in the field as to whether the mind is best viewed as a huge array of small but individually feeble elements ( i .
e .
neurons ) , or as a collection of higher-level structures such as symbols , schemes , plans , and rules .
the former view uses connectionism to study the mind , whereas the latter emphasizes symbolic computations .
one way to view the issue is whether it is possible to accurately simulate a human brain on a computer without accurately simulating the neurons that make up the human brain .
attention is the selection of important information .
the human mind is bombarded with millions of stimuli and it must have a way of deciding which of this information to process .
attention is sometimes seen as a spotlight , meaning one can only shine the light on a particular set of information .
experiments that support this metaphor include the dichotic listening task ( cherry , *num* ) and studies of inattentional blindness ( mack and rock , *num* ) .
in the dichotic listening task , subjects are bombarded with two different messages , one in each ear , and told to focus on only one of the messages .
at the end of the experiment , when asked about the content of the unattended message , subjects cannot report it .
the ability to learn and understand language is an extremely complex process .
language is acquired within the first few years of life , and all humans under normal circumstances are able to acquire language proficiently .
a major driving force in the theoretical linguistic field is discovering the nature that language must have in the abstract in order to be learned in such a fashion .
some of the driving research questions in studying how the brain itself processes language include : ( *num* ) to what extent is linguistic knowledge innate or learned ? , ( *num* ) why is it more difficult for adults to acquire a second-language than it is for infants to acquire their first-language ? , and ( *num* ) how are humans able to understand novel sentences ? the study of language processing ranges from the investigation of the sound patterns of speech to the meaning of words and whole sentences .
linguistics often divides language processing into orthography , phonetics , phonology , morphology , syntax , semantics , and pragmatics .
many aspects of language can be studied from each of these components and from their interaction .
the study of language processing in " cognitive science " is closely tied to the field of linguistics .
linguistics was traditionally studied as a part of the humanities , including studies of history , art and literature .
in the last fifty years or so , more and more researchers have studied knowledge and use of language as a cognitive phenomenon , the main problems being how knowledge of language can be acquired and used , and what precisely it consists of .
linguists have found that , while humans form sentences in ways apparently governed by very complex systems , they are remarkably unaware of the rules that govern their own speech .
thus linguists must resort to indirect methods to determine what those rules might be , if indeed rules as such exist .
in any event , if speech is indeed governed by rules , they appear to be opaque to any conscious consideration .
learning and development are the processes by which we acquire knowledge and information over time .
infants are born with little or no knowledge ( depending on how knowledge is defined ) , yet they rapidly acquire the ability to use language , walk , and recognize people and objects .
research in learning and development aims to explain the mechanisms by which these processes might take place .
a major question in the study of cognitive development is the extent to which certain abilities are innate or learned .
this is often framed in terms of the nature and nurture debate .
the nativist view emphasizes that certain features are innate to an organism and are determined by its genetic endowment .
the empiricist view , on the other hand , emphasizes that certain abilities are learned from the environment .
although clearly both genetic and environmental input is needed for a child to develop normally , considerable debate remains about " how " genetic information might guide cognitive development .
in the area of language acquisition , for example , some ( such as steven pinker ) have argued that specific information containing universal grammatical rules must be contained in the genes , whereas others ( such as jeffrey elman and colleagues in rethinking innateness ) have argued that pinker's claims are biologically unrealistic .
they argue that genes determine the architecture of a learning system , but that specific " facts " about how grammar works can only be learned as a result of experience .
memory allows us to store information for later retrieval .
memory is often thought of as consisting of both a long-term and short-term store .
long-term memory allows us to store information over prolonged periods ( days , weeks , years ) .
we do not yet know the practical limit of long-term memory capacity .
short-term memory allows us to store information over short time scales ( seconds or minutes ) .
memory is also often grouped into declarative and procedural forms .
declarative memory—grouped into subsets of semantic and episodic forms of memory—refers to our memory for facts and specific knowledge , specific meanings , and specific experiences ( e .
g .
" who was the first president of the u .
s .
a .
? " , or " what did i eat for breakfast four days ago ? " ) .
procedural memory allows us to remember actions and motor sequences ( e .
g .
how to ride a bicycle ) and is often dubbed implicit knowledge or memory .
cognitive scientists study memory just as psychologists do , but tend to focus more on how memory bears on cognitive processes , and the interrelationship between cognition and memory .
one example of this could be , what mental processes does a person go through to retrieve a long-lost memory ? or , what differentiates between the cognitive process of recognition ( seeing hints of something before remembering it , or memory in context ) and recall ( retrieving a memory , as in " fill-in-the-blank " ) ? perception is the ability to take in information via the senses , and process it in some way .
vision and hearing are two dominant senses that allow us to perceive the environment .
some questions in the study of visual perception , for example , include : ( *num* ) how are we able to recognize objects ? , ( *num* ) why do we perceive a continuous visual environment , even though we only see small bits of it at any one time ? one tool for studying visual perception is by looking at how people process optical illusions .
the image on the right of a necker cube is an example of a bistable percept , that is , the cube can be interpreted as being oriented in two different directions .
the study of haptic ( tactile ) , olfactory , and gustatory stimuli also fall into the domain of perception .
action is taken to refer to the output of a system .
in humans , this is accomplished through motor responses .
spatial planning and movement , speech production , and complex motor movements are all aspects of action .
consciousness is the awareness whether something is an external object or something within oneself .
this helps the mind having the ability to experience or to feel a sense of self .
many different methodologies are used to study cognitive science .
as the field is highly interdisciplinary , research often cuts across multiple areas of study , drawing on research methods from psychology , neuroscience , computer science and systems theory .
in order to have a description of what constitutes intelligent behavior , one must study behavior itself .
this type of research is closely tied to that in cognitive psychology and psychophysics .
by measuring behavioral responses to different stimuli , one can understand something about how those stimuli are processed .
lewandowski and strohmetz ( *num* ) review a collection of innovative uses of behavioral measurement in psychology including behavioral traces , behavioral observations , and behavioral choice .
behavioral traces are pieces of evidence that indicate behavior occurred , but the actor is not present ( e .
g .
, litter in a parking lot or readings on an electric meter ) .
behavioral observations involve the direct witnessing of the actor engaging in the behavior ( e .
g .
, watching how close a person sits next to another person ) .
behavioral choices are when a person selects between two or more options ( e .
g .
, voting behavior , choice of a punishment for another participant ) .
brain imaging involves analyzing activity within the brain while performing various tasks .
this allows us to link behavior and brain function to help understand how information is processed .
different types of imaging techniques vary in their temporal ( time-based ) and spatial ( location-based ) resolution .
brain imaging is often used in cognitive neuroscience .
computational models require a mathematically and logically formal representation of a problem .
computer models are used in the simulation and experimental verification of different specific and general properties of intelligence .
computational modeling can help us understand the functional organization of a particular cognitive phenomenon .
approaches to cognitive modeling can be categorized as : ( *num* ) symbolic , on abstract mental functions of an intelligent mind by means of symbols ; ( *num* ) subsymbolic , on the neural and associative properties of the human brain ; and ( *num* ) across the symbolic–subsymbolic border , including hybrid .
all the above approaches tend to be generalized to the form of integrated computational models of a synthetic / abstract intelligence , in order to be applied to the explanation and improvement of individual and social / organizational decision-making and reasoning .
research methods borrowed directly from neuroscience and neuropsychology can also help us to understand aspects of intelligence .
these methods allow us to understand how intelligent behavior is implemented in a physical system .
cognitive science has given rise to models of human cognitive bias and risk perception , and has been influential in the development of behavioral finance , part of economics .
it has also given rise to a new theory of the philosophy of mathematics , and many theories of artificial intelligence , persuasion and coercion .
it has made its presence known in the philosophy of language and epistemology as well as constituting a substantial wing of modern linguistics .
fields of cognitive science have been influential in understanding the brain's particular functional systems ( and functional deficits ) ranging from speech production to auditory processing and visual perception .
it has made progress in understanding how damage to particular areas of the brain affect cognition , and it has helped to uncover the root causes and results of specific dysfunction , such as dyslexia , anopia , and hemispatial neglect .
the cognitive sciences began as an intellectual movement in the 1950s , called the cognitive revolution .
cognitive science has a prehistory traceable back to ancient greek philosophical texts ( see plato's meno and aristotle's de anima ) ; and includes writers such as descartes , david hume , immanuel kant , benedict de spinoza , nicolas malebranche , pierre cabanis , leibniz and john locke .
however , although these early writers contributed greatly to the philosophical discovery of mind and this would ultimately lead to the development of psychology , they were working with an entirely different set of tools and core concepts than those of the cognitive scientist .
the modern culture of cognitive science can be traced back to the early cyberneticists in the 1930s and 1940s , such as warren mcculloch and walter pitts , who sought to understand the organizing principles of the mind .
mcculloch and pitts developed the first variants of what are now known as artificial neural networks , models of computation inspired by the structure of biological neural networks .
another precursor was the early development of the theory of computation and the digital computer in the 1940s and 1950s .
kurt gödel , alonzo church , alan turing , and john von neumann were instrumental in these developments .
the modern computer , or von neumann machine , would play a central role in cognitive science , both as a metaphor for the mind , and as a tool for investigation .
the first instance of cognitive science experiments being done at an academic institution took place at mit sloan school of management , established by j .
c .
r .
licklider working within the psychology department and conducting experiments using computer memory as models for human cognition .
in *num* , noam chomsky published a scathing review of b .
f .
skinner's book " verbal behavior " .
at the time , skinner's behaviorist paradigm dominated the field of psychology within the united states .
most psychologists focused on functional relations between stimulus and response , without positing internal representations .
chomsky argued that in order to explain language , we needed a theory like generative grammar , which not only attributed internal representations but characterized their underlying order .
the term " cognitive science " was coined by christopher longuet-higgins in his *num* commentary on the lighthill report , which concerned the then-current state of artificial intelligence research .
in the same decade , the journal " cognitive science " and the cognitive science society were founded .
the founding meeting of the cognitive science society was held at the university of california , san diego in *num* , which resulted in cognitive science becoming an internationally visible enterprise .
in *num* , hampshire college started the first undergraduate education program in cognitive science , led by neil stillings .
in *num* , with assistance from professor stillings , vassar college became the first institution in the world to grant an undergraduate degree in cognitive science .
in *num* , the first cognitive science department in the world was founded at the university of california , san diego .
in the 1970s and early 1980s , as access to computers increased , artificial intelligence research expanded .
researchers such as marvin minsky would write computer programs in languages such as lisp to attempt to formally characterize the steps that human beings went through , for instance , in making decisions and solving problems , in the hope of better understanding human thought , and also in the hope of creating artificial minds .
this approach is known as " symbolic ai " .
eventually the limits of the symbolic ai research program became apparent .
for instance , it seemed to be unrealistic to comprehensively list human knowledge in a form usable by a symbolic computer program .
the late 80s and 90s saw the rise of neural networks and connectionism as a research paradigm .
under this point of view , often attributed to james mcclelland and david rumelhart , the mind could be characterized as a set of complex associations , represented as a layered network .
critics argue that there are some phenomena which are better captured by symbolic models , and that connectionist models are often so complex as to have little explanatory power .
recently symbolic and connectionist models have been combined , making it possible to take advantage of both forms of explanation .
while both connectionism and symbolic approaches have proven useful for testing various hypotheses and exploring approaches to understanding aspects of cognition and lower level brain functions , neither are biologically realistic and therefore , both suffer from a lack of neuroscientific plausibility .
connectionism has proven useful for exploring computationally how cognition emerges in development and occurs in the human brain , and has provided alternatives to strictly domain-specific / domain general approaches .
for example , scientists such as jeff elman , liz bates , and annette karmiloff-smith have posited that networks in the brain emerge from the dynamic interaction between them and environmental input .
some of the more recognized names in cognitive science are usually either the most controversial or the most cited .
within philosophy , some familiar names include daniel dennett , who writes from a computational systems perspective , john searle , known for his controversial chinese room argument , and jerry fodor , who advocates functionalism .
others include david chalmers , who advocates dualism and is also known for articulating the hard problem of consciousness , and douglas hofstadter , famous for writing " gödel , escher , bach " , which questions the nature of words and thought .
in the realm of linguistics , noam chomsky and george lakoff have been influential ( both have also become notable as political commentators ) .
in artificial intelligence , marvin minsky , herbert a .
simon , and allen newell are prominent .
popular names in the discipline of psychology include george a .
miller , james mcclelland , philip johnson-laird , and steven pinker .
anthropologists dan sperber , edwin hutchins , and scott atran , have been involved in collaborative projects with cognitive and social psychologists , political scientists and evolutionary biologists in attempts to develop general theories of culture formation , religion , and political association .
computational theories ( with models and simulations ) have also been developed , by the likes of david rumelhart , james mcclelland , philip johnson-laird , and so on .
other contributions have been made by marvin minsky and noam chomsky .
catalysis catalysis is the process of increasing the rate of a chemical reaction by adding a substance known as a catalyst ( ) , which is not consumed in the catalyzed reaction and can continue to act repeatedly .
because of this , only very small amounts of catalyst are required to alter the reaction rate in principle .
in general , chemical reactions occur faster in the presence of a catalyst because the catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy than the non-catalyzed mechanism .
in catalyzed mechanisms , the catalyst usually reacts to form a temporary intermediate , which then regenerates the original catalyst in a cyclic process .
a substance which provides a mechanism with a higher activation energy does not decrease the rate because the reaction can still occur by the non-catalyzed route .
an added substance which does reduce the reaction rate is not considered a catalyst but a reaction inhibitor ( see below ) .
catalysts may be classified as either homogeneous or heterogeneous .
a homogeneous catalyst is one whose molecules are dispersed in the same phase ( usually gaseous or liquid ) as the reactant's molecules .
a heterogeneous catalyst is one whose molecules are not in the same phase as the reactant's , which are typically gases or liquids that are adsorbed onto the surface of the solid catalyst .
enzymes and other biocatalysts are often considered as a third category .
in the presence of a catalyst , less free energy is required to reach the transition state , but the total free energy from reactants to products does not change .
a catalyst may participate in multiple chemical transformations .
the effect of a catalyst may vary due to the presence of other substances known as inhibitors or poisons ( which reduce the catalytic activity ) or promoters ( which increase the activity and also affect the temperature of the reaction ) .
catalyzed reactions have a lower activation energy ( rate-limiting free energy of activation ) than the corresponding uncatalyzed reaction , resulting in a higher reaction rate at the same temperature and for the same reactant concentrations .
however , the detailed mechanics of catalysis is complex .
catalysts may bind to the reagents to polarize bonds , e .
g .
acid catalysts for reactions of carbonyl compounds , or form specific intermediates that are not produced naturally , such as osmate esters in osmium tetroxide-catalyzed dihydroxylation of alkenes , or cause dissociation of reagents to reactive forms , such as chemisorbed hydrogen in catalytic hydrogenation .
kinetically , catalytic reactions are typical chemical reactions ; i .
e .
the reaction rate depends on the frequency of contact of the reactants in the rate-determining step .
usually , the catalyst participates in this slowest step , and rates are limited by amount of catalyst and its " activity " .
in heterogeneous catalysis , the diffusion of reagents to the surface and diffusion of products from the surface can be rate determining .
a nanomaterial-based catalyst is an example of a heterogeneous catalyst .
analogous events associated with substrate binding and product dissociation apply to homogeneous catalysts .
although catalysts are not consumed by the reaction itself , they may be inhibited , deactivated , or destroyed by secondary processes .
in heterogeneous catalysis , typical secondary processes include coking where the catalyst becomes covered by polymeric side products .
additionally , heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid–liquid system or sublimate in a solid–gas system .
the production of most industrially important chemicals involves catalysis .
similarly , most biochemically significant processes are catalysed .
research into catalysis is a major field in applied science and involves many areas of chemistry , notably organometallic chemistry and materials science .
catalysis is relevant to many aspects of environmental science , e .
g .
the catalytic converter in automobiles and the dynamics of the ozone hole .
catalytic reactions are preferred in environmentally friendly green chemistry due to the reduced amount of waste generated , as opposed to stoichiometric reactions in which all reactants are consumed and more side products are formed .
many transition metals and transition metal complexes are used in catalysis as well .
catalysts called enzymes are important in biology .
a catalyst works by providing an alternative reaction pathway to the reaction product .
the rate of the reaction is increased as this alternative route has a lower activation energy than the reaction route not mediated by the catalyst .
the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide creates water and oxygen , as shown below .
this reaction is preferable in the sense that the reaction products are more stable than the starting material , though the uncatalysed reaction is slow .
in fact , the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is so slow that hydrogen peroxide solutions are commercially available .
this reaction is strongly affected by catalysts such as manganese dioxide , or the enzyme peroxidase in organisms .
upon the addition of a small amount of manganese dioxide , the hydrogen peroxide reacts rapidly .
this effect is readily seen by the effervescence of oxygen .
the manganese dioxide is not consumed in the reaction , and thus may be recovered unchanged , and re-used indefinitely .
accordingly , manganese dioxide " catalyses " this reaction .
catalytic activity is usually denoted by the symbol " z " and measured in mol / s , a unit which was called katal and defined the si unit for catalytic activity since *num* .
catalytic activity is not a kind of reaction rate , but a property of the catalyst under certain conditions , in relation to a specific chemical reaction .
catalytic activity of one katal ( symbol *num* kat = *num* mol / s ) of a catalyst means one mole of that catalyst ( substance , in mol ) will catalyse *num* mole of the reactant to product in one second .
a catalyst may and usually will have different catalytic activity for distinct reactions .
see katal for an example .
there are further derived si units related to catalytic activity , see the above reference for details .
catalysts generally react with one or more reactants to form intermediates that subsequently give the final reaction product , in the process regenerating the catalyst .
the following is a typical reaction scheme , where c represents the catalyst , x and y are reactants , and z is the product of the reaction of x and y : although the catalyst is consumed by reaction , it is subsequently produced by reaction , so it does not occur in the overall reaction equation : as a catalyst is regenerated in a reaction , often only small amounts are needed to increase the rate of the reaction .
in practice , however , catalysts are sometimes consumed in secondary processes .
the catalyst does usually appear in the rate equation .
for example , if the rate-determining step in the above reaction scheme is the first step x + c → xc , the catalyzed reaction will be second order with rate equation v = k [ x ] [ c ] , which is proportional to the catalyst concentration [ c ] .
however [ c ] remains constant during the reaction so that the catalyzed reaction is pseudo-first order : v = k [ x ] , where k = k [ c ] .
as an example of a detailed mechanism at the microscopic level , in *num* danish researchers first revealed the sequence of events when oxygen and hydrogen combine on the surface of titanium dioxide ( tio , or " titania " ) to produce water .
with a time-lapse series of scanning tunneling microscopy images , they determined the molecules undergo adsorption , dissociation and diffusion before reacting .
the intermediate reaction states were : ho , ho , then ho and the final reaction product ( water molecule dimers ) , after which the water molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface .
catalysts work by providing an ( alternative ) mechanism involving a different transition state and lower activation energy .
consequently , more molecular collisions have the energy needed to reach the transition state .
hence , catalysts can enable reactions that would otherwise be blocked or slowed by a kinetic barrier .
the catalyst may increase reaction rate or selectivity , or enable the reaction at lower temperatures .
this effect can be illustrated with an energy profile diagram .
in the catalyzed elementary reaction , catalysts do not change the extent of a reaction : they have no effect on the chemical equilibrium of a reaction because the rate of both the forward and the reverse reaction are both affected ( see also thermodynamics ) .
the second law of thermodynamics describes why a catalyst does not change the chemical equilibrium of a reaction .
suppose there was such a catalyst that shifted an equilibrium .
introducing the catalyst to the system would result in a reaction to move to the new equilibrium , producing energy .
production of energy is a necessary result since reactions are spontaneous only if gibbs free energy is produced , and if there is no energy barrier , there is no need for a catalyst .
then , removing the catalyst would also result in reaction , producing energy ; i .
e .
the addition and its reverse process , removal , would both produce energy .
thus , a catalyst that could change the equilibrium would be a perpetual motion machine , a contradiction to the laws of thermodynamics .
thus , catalyst does not alter the equilibrium constant .
( a catalyst can however change the equilibrium concentrations by reacting in a subsequent step .
it is then consumed as the reaction proceeds , and thus it is also a reactant .
illustrative is the base-catalysed hydrolysis of esters , where the produced carboxylic acid immediately reacts with the base catalyst and thus the reaction equilibrium is shifted towards hydrolysis .
) the si derived unit for measuring the catalytic activity of a catalyst is the katal , which is moles per second .
the productivity of a catalyst can be described by the turnover number ( or ton ) and the catalytic activity by the " turn over frequency " ( tof ) , which is the ton per time unit .
the biochemical equivalent is the enzyme unit .
for more information on the efficiency of enzymatic catalysis , see the article on " enzymes " .
the catalyst stabilizes the transition state more than it stabilizes the starting material .
it decreases the kinetic barrier by decreasing the " difference " in energy between starting material and transition state .
it does not change the energy difference between starting materials and products ( thermodynamic barrier ) , or the available energy ( this is provided by the environment as heat or light ) .
the chemical nature of catalysts is as diverse as catalysis itself , although some generalizations can be made .
proton acids are probably the most widely used catalysts , especially for the many reactions involving water , including hydrolysis and its reverse .
multifunctional solids often are catalytically active , e .
g .
zeolites , alumina , higher-order oxides , graphitic carbon , nanoparticles , nanodots , and facets of bulk materials .
transition metals are often used to catalyze redox reactions ( oxidation , hydrogenation ) .
examples are nickel , such as raney nickel for hydrogenation , and vanadium ( v ) oxide for oxidation of sulfur dioxide into sulfur trioxide by the so-called contact process .
many catalytic processes , especially those used in organic synthesis , require " late transition metals " , such as palladium , platinum , gold , ruthenium , rhodium , or iridium .
some so-called catalysts are really precatalysts .
precatalysts convert to catalysts in the reaction .
for example , wilkinson's catalyst rhcl ( pph ) loses one triphenylphosphine ligand before entering the true catalytic cycle .
precatalysts are easier to store but are easily activated in situ .
because of this preactivation step , many catalytic reactions involve an induction period .
chemical species that improve catalytic activity are called co-catalysts ( cocatalysts ) or promotors in cooperative catalysis .
catalysts can be heterogeneous or homogeneous , depending on whether a catalyst exists in the same phase as the substrate .
biocatalysts ( enzymes ) are often seen as a separate group .
heterogeneous catalysts act in a different phase than the reactants .
most heterogeneous catalysts are solids that act on substrates in a liquid or gaseous reaction mixture .
diverse mechanisms for reactions on surfaces are known , depending on how the adsorption takes place ( langmuir-hinshelwood , eley-rideal , and mars-van krevelen ) .
the total surface area of solid has an important effect on the reaction rate .
the smaller the catalyst particle size , the larger the surface area for a given mass of particles .
a heterogeneous catalyst has active sites , which are the atoms or crystal faces where the reaction actually occurs .
depending on the mechanism , the active site may be either a planar exposed metal surface , a crystal edge with imperfect metal valence or a complicated combination of the two .
thus , not only most of the volume , but also most of the surface of a heterogeneous catalyst may be catalytically inactive .
finding out the nature of the active site requires technically challenging research .
thus , empirical research for finding out new metal combinations for catalysis continues .
for example , in the haber process , finely divided iron serves as a catalyst for the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen .
the reacting gases adsorb onto active sites on the iron particles .
once physically adsorbed , the reagents undergo chemisorption that results in dissociation into adsorbed atomic species , and new bonds between the resulting fragments form in part due to their close proximity .
in this way the particularly strong triple bond in nitrogen is broken , which would be extremely uncommon in the gas phase due to its high activation energy .
thus , the activation energy of the overall reaction is lowered , and the rate of reaction increases .
another place where a heterogeneous catalyst is applied is in the oxidation of sulfur dioxide on vanadium ( v ) oxide for the production of sulfuric acid .
heterogeneous catalysts are typically " supported , " which means that the catalyst is dispersed on a second material that enhances the effectiveness or minimizes their cost .
supports prevent or reduce agglomeration and sintering of the small catalyst particles , exposing more surface area , thus catalysts have a higher specific activity ( per gram ) on a support .
sometimes the support is merely a surface on which the catalyst is spread to increase the surface area .
more often , the support and the catalyst interact , affecting the catalytic reaction .
supports can also be used in nanoparticle synthesis by providing sites for individual molecules of catalyst to chemically bind .
supports are porous materials with a high surface area , most commonly alumina , zeolites or various kinds of activated carbon .
specialized supports include silicon dioxide , titanium dioxide , calcium carbonate , and barium sulfate .
in the context of electrochemistry , specifically in fuel cell engineering , various metal-containing catalysts are used to enhance the rates of the half reactions that comprise the fuel cell .
one common type of fuel cell electrocatalyst is based upon nanoparticles of platinum that are supported on slightly larger carbon particles .
when in contact with one of the electrodes in a fuel cell , this platinum increases the rate of oxygen reduction either to water , or to hydroxide or hydrogen peroxide .
homogeneous catalysts function in the same phase as the reactants , but the mechanistic principles involved in heterogeneous catalysis are generally applicable .
typically homogeneous catalysts are dissolved in a solvent with the substrates .
one example of homogeneous catalysis involves the influence of h on the esterification of carboxylic acids , such as the formation of methyl acetate from acetic acid and methanol .
one high-volume process requiring a homogeneous catalyst is hydroformylation , which adds carbon monoxide to an alkene to produce an alkyl aldehyde .
the aldehyde can be converted to various products such as alcohols or acids ( for e .
g .
detergents ) or polyols ( for plastics such as polycarbonate or polyurethane ) .
for inorganic chemists , homogeneous catalysis is often synonymous with organometallic catalysts .
whereas transition metals sometimes attract most of the attention in the study of catalysis , small organic molecules without metals can also exhibit catalytic properties , as is apparent from the fact that many enzymes lack transition metals .
typically , organic catalysts require a higher loading ( amount of catalyst per unit amount of reactant , expressed in mol % amount of substance ) than transition metal ( -ion ) -based catalysts , but these catalysts are usually commercially available in bulk , helping to reduce costs .
in the early 2000s , these organocatalysts were considered " new generation " and are competitive to traditional metal ( -ion ) -containing catalysts .
organocatalysts are supposed to operate akin to metal-free enzymes utilizing , e .
g .
, non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding .
the discipline organocatalysis is divided in the application of covalent ( e .
g .
, proline , dmap ) and non-covalent ( e .
g .
, thiourea organocatalysis ) organocatalysts referring to the preferred catalyst-substrate binding and interaction , respectively .
photocatalysis is the phenomenon where the catalyst can receive light ( such as visible light ) , be promoted to an excited state , and then undergo intersystem crossing with the starting material , returning to ground state without being consumed .
the excited state of the starting material will then undergo reactions it ordinarily could not if directly illuminated .
for example , singlet oxygen is usually produced by photocatalysis .
photocatalysts are also the main ingredient in dye-sensitized solar cells .
in biology , enzymes are protein-based catalysts in metabolism and catabolism .
most biocatalysts are enzymes , but other non-protein-based classes of biomolecules also exhibit catalytic properties including ribozymes , and synthetic deoxyribozymes .
biocatalysts can be thought of as intermediate between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts , although strictly speaking soluble enzymes are homogeneous catalysts and membrane-bound enzymes are heterogeneous .
several factors affect the activity of enzymes ( and other catalysts ) including temperature , ph , concentration of enzyme , substrate , and products .
a particularly important reagent in enzymatic reactions is water , which is the product of many bond-forming reactions and a reactant in many bond-breaking processes .
in biocatalysis , enzymes are employed to prepare many commodity chemicals including high-fructose corn syrup and acrylamide .
some monoclonal antibodies whose binding target is a stable molecule which resembles the transition state of a chemical reaction can function as weak catalysts for that chemical reaction by lowering its activation energy .
such catalytic antibodies are sometimes called " abzymes " .
nanocatalysts are nanomaterials with catalytic activities .
they have been extensively explored for wide range of applications .
among them , the nanocatalysts with enzyme mimicking activities are collectively called as nanozymes .
in tandem catalysis two or more different catalysts are coupled in a one-pot reaction .
in autocatalysis , the catalyst " is " a product of the overall reaction , in contrast to all other types of catalysis considered in this article .
the simplest example of autocatalysis is a reaction of type a + b → *num* b , in one or in several steps .
the overall reaction is just a → b , so that b is a product .
but since b is also a reactant , it may be present in the rate equation and affect the reaction rate .
as the reaction proceeds , the concentration of b increases and can accelerate the reaction as a catalyst .
in effect , the reaction accelerates itself or is autocatalyzed .
a real example is the hydrolysis of an ester such as aspirin to a carboxylic acid and an alcohol .
in the absence of added acid catalysts , the carboxylic acid product catalyzes the hydrolysis .
estimates are that *num* % of all commercially produced chemical products involve catalysts at some stage in the process of their manufacture .
in *num* , catalytic processes generated about $900 billion in products worldwide .
catalysis is so pervasive that subareas are not readily classified .
some areas of particular concentration are surveyed below .
petroleum refining makes intensive use of catalysis for alkylation , catalytic cracking ( breaking long-chain hydrocarbons into smaller pieces ) , naphtha reforming and steam reforming ( conversion of hydrocarbons into synthesis gas ) .
even the exhaust from the burning of fossil fuels is treated via catalysis : catalytic converters , typically composed of platinum and rhodium , break down some of the more harmful byproducts of automobile exhaust .
with regard to synthetic fuels , an old but still important process is the fischer-tropsch synthesis of hydrocarbons from synthesis gas , which itself is processed via water-gas shift reactions , catalysed by iron .
biodiesel and related biofuels require processing via both inorganic and biocatalysts .
fuel cells rely on catalysts for both the anodic and cathodic reactions .
catalytic heaters generate flameless heat from a supply of combustible fuel .
some of the largest-scale chemicals are produced via catalytic oxidation , often using oxygen .
examples include nitric acid ( from ammonia ) , sulfuric acid ( from sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide by the contact process ) , terephthalic acid from p-xylene , and acrylonitrile from propane and ammonia .
many other chemical products are generated by large-scale reduction , often via hydrogenation .
the largest-scale example is ammonia , which is prepared via the haber process from nitrogen .
methanol is prepared from carbon monoxide .
bulk polymers derived from ethylene and propylene are often prepared via ziegler-natta catalysis .
polyesters , polyamides , and isocyanates are derived via acid-base catalysis .
most carbonylation processes require metal catalysts , examples include the monsanto acetic acid process and hydroformylation .
many fine chemicals are prepared via catalysis ; methods include those of heavy industry as well as more specialized processes that would be prohibitively expensive on a large scale .
examples include the heck reaction , and friedel–crafts reactions .
because most bioactive compounds are chiral , many pharmaceuticals are produced by enantioselective catalysis ( catalytic asymmetric synthesis ) .
one of the most obvious applications of catalysis is the hydrogenation ( reaction with hydrogen gas ) of fats using nickel catalyst to produce margarine .
many other foodstuffs are prepared via biocatalysis ( see below ) .
catalysis impacts the environment by increasing the efficiency of industrial processes , but catalysis also plays a direct role in the environment .
a notable example is the catalytic role of chlorine free radicals in the breakdown of ozone .
these radicals are formed by the action of ultraviolet radiation on chlorofluorocarbons ( cfcs ) .
generally speaking , anything that increases the rate of a process is a " catalyst " , a term derived from greek καταλύειν , meaning " to annul , " or " to untie , " or " to pick up .
" the concept of catalysis was invented by chemist elizabeth fulhame and described in a *num* book , based on her novel work in oxidation-reduction experiments .
the first chemical reaction in organic chemistry that utilized a catalyst was studied in *num* by gottlieb kirchhoff who discovered the acid-catalyzed conversion of starch to glucose .
the term " catalysis " was later used by jöns jakob berzelius in *num* to describe reactions that are accelerated by substances that remain unchanged after the reaction .
fulhame , who predated berzelius , did work with water as opposed to metals in her reduction experiments .
other *ord* century chemists who worked in catalysis were eilhard mitscherlich who referred to it as " contact " processes , and johann wolfgang döbereiner who spoke of " contact action .
" he developed döbereiner's lamp , a lighter based on hydrogen and a platinum sponge , which became a commercial success in the 1820s that lives on today .
humphry davy discovered the use of platinum in catalysis .
in the 1880s , wilhelm ostwald at leipzig university started a systematic investigation into reactions that were catalyzed by the presence of acids and bases , and found that chemical reactions occur at finite rates and that these rates can be used to determine the strengths of acids and bases .
for this work , ostwald was awarded the *num* nobel prize in chemistry .
vladimir ipatieff performed some of the earliest industrial scale reactions , including the discovery and commercialization of oligomerization and the development of catalysts for hydrogenation .
substances that reduce the action of catalysts are called catalyst inhibitors if reversible , and catalyst poisons if irreversible .
promoters are substances that increase the catalytic activity , even though they are not catalysts by themselves .
inhibitors are sometimes referred to as " negative catalysts " since they decrease the reaction rate .
however the term inhibitor is preferred since they do not work by introducing a reaction path with higher activation energy ; this would not reduce the rate since the reaction would continue to occur by the non-catalyzed path .
instead they act either by deactivating catalysts , or by removing reaction intermediates such as free radicals .
the inhibitor may modify selectivity in addition to rate .
for instance , in the reduction of alkynes to alkenes , a palladium ( pd ) catalyst partly " poisoned " with lead ( ii ) acetate ( pb ( chco ) ) can be used .
without the deactivation of the catalyst , the alkene produced would be further reduced to alkane .
the inhibitor can produce this effect by , e .
g .
, selectively poisoning only certain types of active sites .
another mechanism is the modification of surface geometry .
for instance , in hydrogenation operations , large planes of metal surface function as sites of hydrogenolysis catalysis while sites catalyzing hydrogenation of unsaturates are smaller .
thus , a poison that covers surface randomly will tend to reduce the number of uncontaminated large planes but leave proportionally more smaller sites free , thus changing the hydrogenation vs .
hydrogenolysis selectivity .
many other mechanisms are also possible .
promoters can cover up surface to prevent production of a mat of coke , or even actively remove such material ( e .
g .
, rhenium on platinum in platforming ) .
they can aid the dispersion of the catalytic material or bind to reagents .
the global demand for catalysts in *num* was estimated at approximately us$29 .
*num* billion .
with the rapid recovery in the automotive and chemical industries overall , the global catalyst market is expected to experience fast growth in the coming years .
abigail abigail ( , " avigayil " ) was the wife of nabal ; she became a wife of the future king david after nabal's death ( *num* samuel ) .
abigail was david's third wife , after saul's daughter , michal , whom saul later married to palti , son of laish when david went into hiding , and ahinoam .
she became the mother of one of david's sons , who is listed in the book of chronicles under the name " daniel " , in the masoretic text of the books of samuel as " chileab , " and in the septuagint text of *num* samuel *num* : *num* as δαλουια , " dalouia " .
her name is spelled abigal in in the american standard version .
derived from the hebrew word " ab , " " father " , and the hebrew root " g-y-l " , " to rejoice , " the name abigail has a variety of possible meanings including " my father's joy " and " source of joy " .
in *num* samuel *num* , nabal demonstrates ingratitude towards david , and abigail attempts to placate david in order to stop the future king from taking revenge .
she gives him food , and speaks to him , urging him not to " have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed " ( verse *num* , niv ) and reminding him that god will make him a " lasting dynasty " ( verse *num* ) .
jon levenson calls this an " undeniable adumbration " of nathan's prophecy in *num* samuel *num* .
alice bach notes that abigail pronounces a " crucial prophecy , " and the talmud regards her as one of the tanakh's seven female prophets .
levenson , however , suggests that she " senses the drift of history " from intelligence rather than from special revelation .
after abigail reveals to nabal what she has done , " god struck nabal and he died , " ( v .
*num* ) , after which david married her .
abigail is described as intelligent and beautiful .
the talmud amplifies this idea , mentioning her as being one of the " four women of surpassing beauty in the world , " ( the other three being rahab , sarah , and esther ) .
as the wife of the wealthy nabal , she is also a woman of high socioeconomic status .
whether david married her because he was attracted to her , or as an astute political move , or both is unclear .
abigail and david's second wife , ahinoam the jezreelite , accompany david and his war band as they seek refuge in philistine territory .
while david and his men are encamped near jezreel , they are captured by amalekites who raided the town of ziglak and carried off the women and children .
david led the pursuit , and they were subsequently rescued .
both wives then settle with david in hebron , where abigail gives birth to david's second son , chileab ( also called daniel ) .
abigail is also listed as one of the seven jewish women prophets , the other six being miriam , deborah , hannah , sarah , huldah , and esther .
in terms of her moral character , abraham kuyper argues that abigail's conduct indicates " a most appealing character and unwavering faith , " but alice bach regards her as subversive .
adele berlin contrasts the story of abigail with that of bathsheba .
in one , the wife prevents david from murdering her foolish and greedy husband .
in the second , david orders the murder of a good man because he desires his wife .
" in the abigail story , david , the potential king , is seen as increasingly strong and virtuous , whereas in the bathsheba story , the reigning monarch shows his flaws ever more overtly and begins to lose control of his family .
" levenson and halpern suggest that abigail may , in fact , also be the same person as abigail , mother of amasa .
richard m .
davidson , however , points out that " on the basis of the final form of old testament canon , references to abigail in the biblical accounts indicate two different individuals .
" abigail's self-styling as a " handmaid " led to " abigail " being a traditional term for a waiting-woman , for example as the " waiting gentlewoman " in beaumont and fletcher's " the scornful lady " , published in *num* .
jonathan swift and henry fielding use " abigail " in this generic sense , as does charlotte brontë .
anthony trollope makes two references to " the abigail " ( all lower case ) in " the eustace diamonds " , at the beginning of chapter *num* , whilst thomas mann makes the same reference at the start of the second chapter of part *num* in buddenbrooks ( published in *num* ) .
william rose benet notes the notoriety of abigail hill , better known as " mrs masham " , a lady-in-waiting to queen anne .
george macdonald fraser makes mention of " an " abigail " fussing about the room " in his novel " flashman " from " the flashman papers " series .
abigail is a featured figure on judy chicago's installation piece " the dinner party " , being represented in one of the *num* tiles of the " heritage floor .
emperor kōshō no firm dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign , but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from *num* to *num* bc , but he may have lived in the early *ord* century .
modern scholars have come to question the existence of at least the first nine emperors ; suizei's descendant , emperor sujin is the first that many agree might have actually existed .
the name kōshō"-tennō " was assigned to him posthumously by later generations .
kōshō is regarded by historians as a " legendary emperor " .
there is insufficient material available for further verification and study .
the reign of emperor kinmei ( – *num* ad ) , the *ord* emperor , is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates ; however , the conventionally accepted names and dates of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as " traditional " until the reign of emperor kanmu ( 737–806 ) , the *ord* sovereign of the yamato dynasty .
in the " kojiki " and " nihon shoki " only his name and genealogy were recorded .
he is believed to be the oldest son of emperor itoku ; and his mother is believed to have been amanotoyototsu-hime , who was the daughter of okishimimi-no-kami .
the japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence , and an imperial " misasagi " or tomb for itoku is currently maintained ; however , no extant contemporary records have been discovered that confirm a view that this historical figure actually reigned .
he is considered to have been the fourth of eight emperors without specific legends associated with them , also known as the .
emperor kōshō was the eldest son of emperor itoku .
jien records that he ruled from the palace of " ikekokoro-no-miya " at waki-no-kami in what would come to be known as yamato province .
this posthumous name literally means " filial manifestation " .
it is undisputed that this identification is chinese in form and buddhist in implication , which suggests that the name must have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to kōshō , possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the yamato dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the " kojiki " .
the actual site of kōshō's grave is not known .
this emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial shinto shrine ( " misasagi " ) in gose .
the imperial household agency designates this location as kōshō's mausoleum .
it is formally named " waki-no-kami no hakata no yama no e no misasagi " .
control engineering control engineering or control systems engineering is an engineering discipline that applies automatic control theory to design systems with desired behaviors in control environments .
the discipline of controls overlaps and is usually taught along with electrical engineering at many institutions around the world .
the practice uses sensors and detectors to measure the output performance of the process being controlled ; these measurements are used to provide corrective feedback helping to achieve the desired performance .
systems designed to perform without requiring human input are called automatic control systems ( such as cruise control for regulating the speed of a car ) .
multi-disciplinary in nature , control systems engineering activities focus on implementation of control systems mainly derived by mathematical modeling of a diverse range of systems .
modern day control engineering is a relatively new field of study that gained significant attention during the *ord* century with the advancement of technology .
it can be broadly defined or classified as practical application of control theory .
control engineering has an essential role in a wide range of control systems , from simple household washing machines to high-performance f-16 fighter aircraft .
it seeks to understand physical systems , using mathematical modelling , in terms of inputs , outputs and various components with different behaviors ; use control systems design tools to develop controllers for those systems ; and implement controllers in physical systems employing available technology .
a system can be mechanical , electrical , fluid , chemical , financial or biological , and the mathematical modelling , analysis and controller design uses control theory in one or many of the time , frequency and complex-s domains , depending on the nature of the design problem .
automatic control systems were first developed over two thousand years ago .
the first feedback control device on record is thought to be the ancient ktesibios's water clock in alexandria , egypt around the third century b .
c .
e .
it kept time by regulating the water level in a vessel and , therefore , the water flow from that vessel .
this certainly was a successful device as water clocks of similar design were still being made in baghdad when the mongols captured the city in *num* a .
d .
a variety of automatic devices have been used over the centuries to accomplish useful tasks or simply to just entertain .
the latter includes the automata , popular in europe in the *ord* and *ord* centuries , featuring dancing figures that would repeat the same task over and over again ; these automata are examples of open-loop control .
milestones among feedback , or " closed-loop " automatic control devices , include the temperature regulator of a furnace attributed to drebbel , circa *num* , and the centrifugal flyball governor used for regulating the speed of steam engines by james watt in *num* .
in his *num* paper " on governors " , james clerk maxwell was able to explain instabilities exhibited by the flyball governor using differential equations to describe the control system .
this demonstrated the importance and usefulness of mathematical models and methods in understanding complex phenomena , and it signalled the beginning of mathematical control and systems theory .
elements of control theory had appeared earlier but not as dramatically and convincingly as in maxwell's analysis .
control theory made significant strides over the next century .
new mathematical techniques , as well as advancements in electronic and computer technologies , made it possible to control significantly more complex dynamical systems than the original flyball governor could stabilize .
new mathematical techniques included developments in optimal control in the 1950s and 1960s followed by progress in stochastic , robust , adaptive , nonlinear , and azid-based control methods in the 1970s and 1980s .
applications of control methodology have helped to make possible space travel and communication satellites , safer and more efficient aircraft , cleaner automobile engines , and cleaner and more efficient chemical processes .
before it emerged as a unique discipline , control engineering was practiced as a part of mechanical engineering and control theory was studied as a part of electrical engineering since electrical circuits can often be easily described using control theory techniques .
in the very first control relationships , a current output was represented by a voltage control input .
however , not having adequate technology to implement electrical control systems , designers were left with the option of less efficient and slow responding mechanical systems .
a very effective mechanical controller that is still widely used in some hydro plants is the governor .
later on , previous to modern power electronics , process control systems for industrial applications were devised by mechanical engineers using pneumatic and hydraulic control devices , many of which are still in use today .
there are two major divisions in control theory , namely , classical and modern , which have direct implications for the control engineering applications .
the scope of classical control theory is limited to single-input and single-output ( siso ) system design , except when analyzing for disturbance rejection using a second input .
the system analysis is carried out in the time domain using differential equations , in the complex-s domain with the laplace transform , or in the frequency domain by transforming from the complex-s domain .
many systems may be assumed to have a second order and single variable system response in the time domain .
a controller designed using classical theory often requires on-site tuning due to incorrect design approximations .
yet , due to the easier physical implementation of classical controller designs as compared to systems designed using modern control theory , these controllers are preferred in most industrial applications .
the most common controllers designed using classical control theory are pid controllers .
a less common implementation may include either or both a lead or lag filter .
the ultimate end goal is to meet requirements typically provided in the time-domain called the step response , or at times in the frequency domain called the open-loop response .
the step response characteristics applied in a specification are typically percent overshoot , settling time , etc .
the open-loop response characteristics applied in a specification are typically gain and phase margin and bandwidth .
these characteristics may be evaluated through simulation including a dynamic model of the system under control coupled with the compensation model .
in contrast , modern control theory is carried out in the state space , and can deal with multiple-input and multiple-output ( mimo ) systems .
this overcomes the limitations of classical control theory in more sophisticated design problems , such as fighter aircraft control , with the limitation that no frequency domain analysis is possible .
in modern design , a system is represented to the greatest advantage as a set of decoupled first order differential equations defined using state variables .
nonlinear , multivariable , adaptive and robust control theories come under this division .
matrix methods are significantly limited for mimo systems where linear independence cannot be assured in the relationship between inputs and outputs .
being fairly new , modern control theory has many areas yet to be explored .
scholars like rudolf e .
kalman and aleksandr lyapunov are well-known among the people who have shaped modern control theory .
control engineering is the engineering discipline that focuses on the modeling of a diverse range of dynamic systems ( e .
g .
mechanical systems ) and the design of controllers that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner .
although such controllers need not be electrical , many are and hence control engineering is often viewed as a subfield of electrical engineering .
however , the falling price of microprocessors is making the actual implementation of a control system essentially trivial .
as a result , focus is shifting back to the mechanical and process engineering discipline , as intimate knowledge of the physical system being controlled is often desired .
electrical circuits , digital signal processors and microcontrollers can all be used to implement control systems .
control engineering has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of commercial airliners to the cruise control present in many modern automobiles .
in most cases , control engineers utilize feedback when designing control systems .
this is often accomplished using a pid controller system .
for example , in an automobile with cruise control the vehicle's speed is continuously monitored and fed back to the system , which adjusts the motor's torque accordingly .
where there is regular feedback , control theory can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback .
in practically all such systems stability is important and control theory can help ensure stability is achieved .
although feedback is an important aspect of control engineering , control engineers may also work on the control of systems without feedback .
this is known as open loop control .
a classic example of open loop control is a washing machine that runs through a pre-determined cycle without the use of sensors .
at many universities around the world , control engineering courses are taught primarily in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering , but some courses can be instructed in mechatronics engineering , and aerospace engineering .
in others , control engineering is connected to computer science , as most control techniques today are implemented through computers , often as embedded systems ( as in the automotive field ) .
the field of control within chemical engineering is often known as process control .
it deals primarily with the control of variables in a chemical process in a plant .
it is taught as part of the undergraduate curriculum of any chemical engineering program and employs many of the same principles in control engineering .
other engineering disciplines also overlap with control engineering as it can be applied to any system for which a suitable model can be derived .
however , specialised control engineering departments do exist , for example , the department of automatic control and systems engineering at the university of sheffield and the department of systems engineering at the united states naval academy .
control engineering has diversified applications that include science , finance management , and even human behavior .
students of control engineering may start with a linear control system course dealing with the time and complex-s domain , which requires a thorough background in elementary mathematics and laplace transform , called classical control theory .
in linear control , the student does frequency and time domain analysis .
digital control and nonlinear control courses require z transformation and algebra respectively , and could be said to complete a basic control education .
originally , control engineering was all about continuous systems .
development of computer control tools posed a requirement of discrete control system engineering because the communications between the computer-based digital controller and the physical system are governed by a computer clock .
the equivalent to laplace transform in the discrete domain is the z-transform .
today , many of the control systems are computer controlled and they consist of both digital and analog components .
therefore , at the design stage either digital components are mapped into the continuous domain and the design is carried out in the continuous domain , or analog components are mapped into discrete domain and design is carried out there .
the first of these two methods is more commonly encountered in practice because many industrial systems have many continuous systems components , including mechanical , fluid , biological and analog electrical components , with a few digital controllers .
similarly , the design technique has progressed from paper-and-ruler based manual design to computer-aided design and now to computer-automated design or cautod which has been made possible by evolutionary computation .
cautod can be applied not just to tuning a predefined control scheme , but also to controller structure optimisation , system identification and invention of novel control systems , based purely upon a performance requirement , independent of any specific control scheme .
resilient control systems extend the traditional focus of addressing only planned disturbances to frameworks and attempt to address multiple types of unexpected disturbance ; in particular , adapting and transforming behaviors of the control system in response to malicious actors , abnormal failure modes , undesirable human action , etc .

steve jobs asked to buy the company for five million dollars in *num* , but warnock and geschke refused .
their investors urged them to work something out with jobs , so they agreed to sell him shares worth *num* percent of the company , for which jobs paid a five-times multiple of their company's valuation at the time , plus a five-year license fee for postscript , in advance .
the purchase and advance made adobe the first company in the history of silicon valley to become profitable in its first year .
warnock and geschke considered various business options including a copy-service business and a turnkey system for office printing .
then they chose to focus on developing specialized printing software , and created the adobe postscript page description language .
postscript was the first truly international standard for computer printing as it included algorithms describing the letter-forms of many languages .
adobe added kanji printer products in *num* .
warnock and geschke were also able to bolster the credibility of postscript by connecting with a typesetting manufacturer .
they weren't able to work with compugraphic , but then worked with linotype to license the helvetica and times roman fonts ( through the linotron *num* ) .
by *num* , postscript had become the industry-standard printer language with more than *num* third-party software programs and licensing agreements with *num* printer companies .
warnock described the language as " extensible " , in its ability to apply graphic arts standards to office printing .
adobe's first products after postscript were digital fonts , which they released in a proprietary format called type *num* .
apple subsequently developed a competing standard , truetype , which provided full scalability and precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font's outlines , and licensed it to microsoft .
in the mid-1980s , adobe entered the consumer software market with illustrator , a vector-based drawing program for the apple macintosh .
illustrator , which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software , helped popularize postscript-enabled laser printers .

was named one of " canada's top *num* employers " by mediacorp canada inc .
, and was featured in " maclean's " newsmagazine .
adobe has a five star privacy rating from the electronic frontier foundation .
adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices , with retail prices being up to twice as much in non-us countries .
as pointed out by many , it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the united states and purchase one particular collection of adobe's software there than to buy it locally in australia .
after adobe revealed the pricing for the creative suite *num* master collection , which was £1 , *num* higher for european customers , a petition to protest over " unfair pricing " was published and signed by *num* , *num* users .

adobe's reader and flash programs were listed on " the *num* most hated programs of all time " article by " techradar " .
hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in adobe programs , such as adobe reader , to gain unauthorized access to computers .
adobe's flash player has also been criticized for , among other things , suffering from performance , memory usage and security problems ( see criticism of flash player ) .
a report by security researchers from kaspersky lab criticized adobe for producing the products having top *num* security vulnerabilities .
observers noted that adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the creative suite *num* software and quietly sending user data to a firm named omniture .
when users became aware , adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they : " could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account " .
when a security flaw was later discovered in photoshop cs5 , adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched , so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade .
following a fierce backlash adobe decided to provide the software patch .
adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including third-party browser toolbars and free virus scanners , usually as part of the flash update process , and for pushing a third-party scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs .
on october *num* , *num* , the company initially revealed that *num* .
*num* million customers ' sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information .
adobe later admitted that *num* million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their ids and encrypted passwords , as well as to many inactive adobe accounts .
the company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted , such as email addresses and physical addresses , though data privacy laws in *num* states require this information to be encrypted .
a *num* .
*num* gb file stolen from adobe and containing *num* million usernames , reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on anonnews .
org .
lastpass , a password security firm , said that adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them .
another security firm , sophos , showed that adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort .
according to it expert simon bain , adobe has failed its customers and ' should hang their heads in shame ' .
many of the credit cards were tied to the creative cloud software-by-subscription service .
adobe offered its affected us customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service , but no similar arrangements have been made for non-us customers .
when a data breach occurs in the us , penalties depend on the state where the victim resides , not where the company is based .
after stealing the customers ' data , cyber-thieves also accessed adobe's source code repository , likely in mid-august *num* .
because hackers acquired copies of the source code of adobe proprietary products , they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security , computer experts warned .
security researcher alex holden , chief information security officer of hold security , characterized this adobe breach , which affected acrobat , coldfusion and numerous other applications , as " one of the worst in us history " .
adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of photoshop , which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques and would make it easier to pirate adobe's expensive products .
published on a server of a russian-speaking hacker group , the " disclosure of encryption algorithms , other security schemes , and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data " and may have opened the gateway to new generation zero-day attacks .
hackers already used coldfusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of pr newswire's customers , which has been tied to the adobe security breach .
they also used a coldfusion exploit to breach washington state court and expose up to *num* , *num* social security numbers .
adobe acquired aldus corp .
in *num* , a software vendor that sold freehand , a competing product .
freehand was direct competition to adobe illustrator , adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor .
the federal trade commission intervened and forced adobe to sell freehand back to altsys , and also banned adobe from buying back freehand or any similar program for the next *num* years ( 1994-2004 ) .
altsys was then bought by macromedia , which released versions *num* to *num* .
when adobe acquired macromedia in december *num* , it stalled development of freehand in *num* , effectively rendering it obsolete .
with freehand and illustrator , adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for macintosh operating systems .
in *num* , a group of *num* , *num* freehand graphic designers convened under the banner " free freehand " , and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the us district court for the northern district of california against adobe .
the suit alleged that " adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market " and that " adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anti-competitive acts and strategies designed to kill freehand , the dominant competitor to adobe's illustrator software product , instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism .
" adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled .
the freehand community believes adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally .
, on its freehand product page adobe stated " "while we recognize freehand has a loyal customer base , we encourage users to migrate to the new adobe illustrator cs4 software which supports both powerpc and intel-based macs and microsoft windows xp and windows vista .
" " , the freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the illustrator page .
adobe's software ftp server still contains a directory for freehand , but it is empty .
alexios i komnenos alexios i komnenos ( , – *num* august *num* ) , latinized alexius i comnenus , was byzantine emperor from *num* to *num* .
although he was not the founder of the komnenian dynasty , it was during his reign that the komnenos family came to full power .
inheriting a collapsing empire and faced with constant warfare during his reign against both the seljuq turks in asia minor and the normans in the western balkans , alexios was able to curb the byzantine decline and begin the military , financial , and territorial recovery known as the " komnenian restoration " .
the basis for this recovery were various reforms initiated by alexios .
his appeals to western europe for help against the turks were also the catalyst that likely contributed to the convoking of the crusades .
alexios was the son of the domestic of the schools john komnenos and anna dalassene , and the nephew of isaac i komnenos ( emperor 1057–1059 ) .
alexios ' father declined the throne on the abdication of isaac , who was thus succeeded by four emperors of other families between *num* and *num* .
under one of these emperors , romanos iv diogenes ( 1067–1071 ) , alexios served with distinction against the seljuq turks .
under michael vii doukas " parapinakes " ( 1071–1078 ) and nikephoros iii botaneiates ( 1078–1081 ) , he was also employed , along with his elder brother isaac , against rebels in asia minor , thrace , and in epirus .
in *num* , western mercenaries led by roussel de bailleul rebelled in asia minor , but alexios successfully subdued them by *num* .
in *num* , he was appointed commander of the field army in the west by nikephoros iii .
in this capacity , alexios defeated the rebellions of nikephoros bryennios the elder ( whose son or grandson later married alexios ' daughter anna ) and nikephoros basilakes , the first at the battle of kalavrye and the latter in a surprise night attack on his camp .
alexios was ordered to march against his brother-in-law nikephoros melissenos in asia minor but refused to fight his kinsman .
this did not , however , lead to a demotion , as alexios was needed to counter the expected invasion of the normans of southern italy , led by robert guiscard .
while byzantine troops were assembling for the expedition , the doukas faction at court approached alexios and convinced him to join a conspiracy against nikephoros iii .
the mother of alexios , anna dalassene , was to play a prominent role in this coup d'état of *num* , along with the current empress , maria of alania .
first married to michael vii doukas and secondly to nikephoros iii botaneiates , she was preoccupied with the future of her son by michael vii , constantine doukas .
nikephoros iii intended to leave the throne to one of his close relatives , and this resulted in maria's ambivalence and alliance with the komnenoi , though the real driving force behind this political alliance was anna dalassene .
the empress was already closely connected to the komnenoi through maria's cousin irene's marriage to isaac komnenos , so the komnenoi brothers were able to see her under the pretense of a friendly family visit .
furthermore , to aid the conspiracy maria had adopted alexios as her son , though she was only five years older than he .
maria was persuaded to do so on the advice of her own " alans " and her eunuchs , who had been instigated by isaac komnenos .
given anna's tight hold on her family , alexios must have been adopted with her implicit approval .
as a result , alexios and constantine , maria's son , were now adoptive brothers , and both isaac and alexios took an oath that they would safeguard his rights as emperor .
by secretly giving inside information to the komnenoi , maria was an invaluable ally .
as stated in the alexiad , isaac and alexios left constantinople in mid-february *num* to raise an army against botaneiates .
however , when the time came , anna quickly and surreptitiously mobilized the remainder of the family and took refuge in the hagia sophia .
from there she negotiated with the emperor for the safety of family members left in the capital , while protesting her sons ' innocence of hostile actions .
under the falsehood of making a vesperal visit to worship at the church , she deliberately excluded the grandson of botaneiates and his loyal tutor , met with alexios and isaac , and fled for the forum of constantine .
the tutor discovered they were missing and eventually found them on the palace grounds , but anna was able to convince him that they would return to the palace shortly .
then to gain entrance to both the outer and inner sanctuary of the church , the women pretended to the gatekeepers that they were pilgrims from cappadocia who had spent all their funds and wanted to worship before starting their return trip .
however , before they were to gain entry into the sanctuary , straboromanos and royal guards caught up with them to summon them back to the palace .
anna then protested that the family was in fear for their lives , her sons were loyal subjects ( alexios and isaac were discovered absent without leave ) , and had learned of a plot by enemies of the komnenoi to have them both blinded and had , therefore , fled the capital so they may continue to be of loyal service to the emperor .
she refused to go with them and demanded that they allow her to pray to the mother of god for protection .
this request was granted and anna then manifested her true theatrical and manipulative capabilities : nikephoros iii botaneiates was forced into a public vow that he would grant protection to the family .
straboromanos tried to give anna his cross , but for her it was not sufficiently large enough for all bystanders to witness the oath .
she also demanded that the cross be personally sent by botaneiates as a vow of his good faith .
he obliged , sending a complete assurance for the family with his own cross .
at the emperor's further insistence , and for their own protection , they took refuge at the convent of petrion , where they were eventually joined by maria of bulgaria , mother of irene doukaina .
botaneiates allowed them to be treated as refugees rather than as guests .
they were allowed to have family members bring in their own food and were on good terms with the guards from whom they learned the latest news .
anna was highly successful in three important aspects of the revolt : she bought time for her sons to steal imperial horses from the stables and escape the city ; she distracted the emperor , giving her sons time to gather and arm their troops ; and she gave a false sense of security to botaneiates that there was no real treasonous coup against him .
after bribing the western troops guarding the city , isaac and alexios komnenos entered the capital victoriously on april *num* , *num* .
during this time , alexios was rumored to be the lover of empress maria of alania , the daughter of king bagrat iv of georgia , who had been successively married to michael vii doukas and his successor nikephoros iii botaneiates , and who was renowned for her beauty .
alexios arranged for maria to stay on the palace grounds , and it was thought that he was considering marrying her .
however , his mother consolidated the doukas family connection by arranging the emperor's marriage to irene doukaina , granddaughter of the caesar john doukas , the uncle of michael vii , who would not have supported alexios otherwise .
as a measure intended to keep the support of the doukai , alexios restored constantine doukas , the young son of michael vii and maria , as co-emperor and a little later betrothed him to his own first-born daughter anna , who moved into the mangana palace with her fiancé and his mother .
this situation changed drastically , however , when alexios ' first son john ii komnenos was born in *num* : anna's engagement to constantine was dissolved , and she was moved to the main palace to live with her mother and grandmother .
alexios became estranged from maria , who was stripped of her imperial title and retired to a monastery , and constantine doukas was deprived of his status as co-emperor .
nevertheless , he remained in good relations with the imperial family and succumbed to his weak constitution soon afterwards .
the nearly thirty-seven year reign of alexios was full of struggle .
at the outset he faced the formidable attack of the normans , led by robert guiscard and his son bohemund , who took dyrrhachium and corfu and laid siege to larissa in thessaly ( see battle of dyrrhachium ) .
alexios suffered several defeats before he was able to strike back with success .
he enhanced his resistance by bribing the german king henry iv with *num* , *num* gold pieces to attack the normans in italy , which forced the normans to concentrate on their defenses at home in 1083–84 .
he also secured the alliance of henry , count of monte sant'angelo , who controlled the gargano peninsula and dated his charters by alexios ' reign .
henry's allegiance would be the last example of byzantine political control on peninsular italy .
the norman danger subsided with the death of guiscard in *num* , and the byzantines recovered most of their losses .
alexios next had to deal with disturbances in thrace , where the heretical sects of the bogomils and the paulicians revolted and made common cause with the pechenegs from beyond the danube .
paulician soldiers in imperial service likewise deserted during alexios ' battles with the normans .
as soon as the norman threat had passed , alexios set out to punish the rebels and deserters , confiscating their lands .
this led to a further revolt near philippopolis , and the commander of the field army in the west , gregory pakourianos , was defeated and killed in the ensuing battle .
in *num* the pechenegs raided into thrace , and alexios crossed into moesia to retaliate but failed to take dorostolon ( silistra ) .
during his retreat , the emperor was surrounded and worn down by the pechenegs , who forced him to sign a truce and to pay protection money .
in *num* the pechenegs invaded thrace again , while tzachas , the brother-in-law of the sultan of rum , launched a fleet and attempted to arrange a joint siege of constantinople with the pechenegs .
alexios overcame this crisis by entering into an alliance with a horde of *num* , *num* cumans , with whose help he crushed the pechenegs at levounion in thrace on *num* april *num* .
this put an end to the pecheneg threat , but in *num* the cumans began to raid the imperial territories in the balkans .
led by a pretender claiming to be constantine diogenes , a long-dead son of the emperor romanos iv , the cumans crossed the mountains and raided into eastern thrace until their leader was eliminated at adrianople .
with the balkans more or less pacified , alexios could now turn his attention to asia minor , which had been almost completely overrun by the seljuq turks .
by the time alexios ascended the throne , the seljuqs had taken most of asia minor .
alexios was able to secure much of the coastal regions by sending peasant soldiers to raid the seljuq camps , but these victories were unable to stop the turks altogether .
as early as *num* , alexios had taken reconciliatory measures towards the papacy , with the intention of seeking western support against the seljuqs .
in *num* his ambassadors appeared before pope urban ii at the council of piacenza .
the help he sought from the west was simply some mercenary forces , not the immense hosts that arrived , to his consternation and embarrassment , after the pope preached the first crusade at the council of clermont later that same year .
not quite ready to supply this number of people as they traversed his territories , the emperor saw his balkan possessions subjected to further pillage at the hands of his own allies .
alexios dealt with this first , disorganized group of crusaders ( the people's crusade : a mob of mostly unarmed pilgrims led by the preacher peter the hermit ) by eventually hustling them on to asia minor , where they were massacred by the turks in *num* .
the " prince's crusade " , the second and much more formidable host of crusaders , gradually made its way to constantinople , led in sections by godfrey of bouillon , bohemond of taranto , raymond iv of toulouse , and other important members of the western nobility .
alexios used the opportunity to meet the crusader leaders separately as they arrived , extracting from them oaths of homage and the promise to turn over conquered lands to the byzantine empire .
transferring each contingent into asia , alexios promised to supply them with provisions in return for their oaths of homage .
the crusade was a notable success for byzantium , as alexios recovered a number of important cities and islands .
the siege of nicaea by the crusaders forced the city to surrender to the emperor in *num* , and the subsequent crusader victory at dorylaion allowed the byzantine forces to recover much of western asia minor .
john doukas re-established byzantine rule in chios , rhodes , smyrna , ephesus , sardis , and philadelphia in 1097–1099 .
this success is ascribed by alexios ' daughter anna to his policy and diplomacy , but by the latin historians of the crusade to his treachery and deception .
in *num* , a byzantine fleet of ten ships was sent to assist the crusaders in capturing laodicea and other coastal towns as far as tripoli .
the crusaders believed their oaths were made invalid when the byzantine contingent under tatikios failed to help them during the siege of antioch ; bohemund , who had set himself up as prince of antioch , briefly went to war with alexios in the balkans , but he was blockaded by the byzantine forces and agreed to become a vassal of alexios by the treaty of devol in *num* .
in *num* , though already terminally ill , alexios conducted a series of defensive operations in bythinia and mysia to defend his anatolian territories against the inroads of malik shah , the seljuq sultan of iconium .
in *num* he moved onto the offensive and pushed his army deep into the turkish-dominated anatolian plateau , where he defeated the seljuq sultan at the battle of philomelion .
during the last twenty years of his life alexios lost much of his popularity .
the years were marked by persecution of the followers of the paulician and bogomil heresies—one of his last acts was to publicly burn at the stake basil , a bogomil leader , with whom he had engaged in a theological dispute .
in spite of the success of the first crusade , alexios also had to repel numerous attempts on his territory by the seljuqs in 1110–1117 .
alexios was for many years under the strong influence of an " eminence grise " , his mother anna dalassene , a wise and immensely able politician whom , in a uniquely irregular fashion , he had crowned as " augusta " instead of the rightful claimant to the title , his wife irene doukaina .
alexios was never happier than when taking part in military exercises and he assumed personal command of his troops whenever possible .
as such , dalassene was the effective administrator of the empire during alexios ' long absences in military campaigns : she was constantly at odds with her daughter-in-law and had assumed total responsibility for the upbringing and education of her granddaughter anna komnene .
alexios ' last years were also troubled by anxieties over the succession .
although he had crowned his son john ii komnenos co-emperor at the age of five in *num* , his wife , irene doukaina wished to alter the succession in favor of their daughter anna and anna's husband , nikephoros bryennios the younger .
bryennios had been made " kaisar " ( caesar ) and received the newly created title of " panhypersebastos " ( " honoured above all " ) , and remained loyal to both alexios and john .
nevertheless , the intrigues of irene and anna disturbed even alexios ' dying hours .
apart from all of his external enemies , a host of rebels also sought to overthrow alexios from the imperial throne , thereby posing another major threat to his reign .
due to the troubled times the empire was enduring , he had by far the greatest number of rebellions against him of all the byzantine emperors .
these included : under alexios the debased " solidus " ( " tetarteron " and " histamenon " ) was discontinued and a gold coinage of higher fineness ( generally .
900– .
*num* ) was established in *num* , commonly called the " hyperpyron " at *num* .
*num* grs .
the " hyperpyron " was slightly smaller than the " solidus " .
it was introduced along with the electrum " aspron trachy " worth a third of a " hyperpyron " and about *num* % gold and *num* % silver , the billon " aspron trachy " or " stamenon " , valued at *num* to the " hyperpyron " and with *num* % silver wash and the copper " tetarteron " and " noummion " worth *num* and *num* to the billon " aspron trachy " .
alexios ' reform of the byzantine monetary system was an important basis for the financial recovery and therefore supported the so-called komnenian restoration , as the new coinage restored financial confidence .
alexios i had overcome a dangerous crisis and stabilized the byzantine empire , inaugurating a century of imperial prosperity and success .
he had also profoundly altered the nature of the byzantine government .
by seeking close alliances with powerful noble families , alexios put an end to the tradition of imperial exclusivity and co-opted most of the nobility into his extended family and , through it , his government .
those who did not become part of this extended family were deprived of power and prestige .
this measure , which was intended to diminish opposition , was paralleled by the introduction of new courtly dignities , like that of " panhypersebastos " given to nikephoros bryennios , or that of " sebastokrator " given to the emperor's brother isaac komnenos .
although this policy met with initial success , it gradually undermined the relative effectiveness of imperial bureaucracy by placing family connections over merit .
alexios ' policy of integration of the nobility bore the fruit of continuity : every byzantine emperor who reigned after alexios i komnenos was related to him by either descent or marriage .

the database management system ( dbms ) is the software that interacts with end users , applications , and the database itself to capture and analyze the data .
the dbms software additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database .
the sum total of the database , the dbms and the associated applications can be referred to as a " database system " .
often the term " database " is also used to loosely refer to any of the dbms , the database system or an application associated with the database .
computer scientists may classify database-management systems according to the database models that they support .
relational databases became dominant in the 1980s .
these model data as rows and columns in a series of tables , and the vast majority use sql for writing and querying data .
in the 2000s , non-relational databases became popular , referred to as nosql because they use different query languages .
formally , a " database " refers to a set of related data and the way it is organized .
access to this data is usually provided by a " database management system " ( dbms ) consisting of an integrated set of computer software that allows users to interact with one or more databases and provides access to all of the data contained in the database ( although restrictions may exist that limit access to particular data ) .
the dbms provides various functions that allow entry , storage and retrieval of large quantities of information and provides ways to manage how that information is organized .
because of the close relationship between them , the term " database " is often used casually to refer to both a database and the dbms used to manipulate it .
outside the world of professional information technology , the term " database " is often used to refer to any collection of related data ( such as a spreadsheet or a card index ) as size and usage requirements typically necessitate use of a database management system .
existing dbmss provide various functions that allow management of a database and its data which can be classified into four main functional groups : both a database and its dbms conform to the principles of a particular database model .
" database system " refers collectively to the database model , database management system , and database .
physically , database servers are dedicated computers that hold the actual databases and run only the dbms and related software .
database servers are usually multiprocessor computers , with generous memory and raid disk arrays used for stable storage .
raid is used for recovery of data if any of the disks fail .
hardware database accelerators , connected to one or more servers via a high-speed channel , are also used in large volume transaction processing environments .
dbmss are found at the heart of most database applications .
dbmss may be built around a custom multitasking kernel with built-in networking support , but modern dbmss typically rely on a standard operating system to provide these functions .
since dbmss comprise a significant market , computer and storage vendors often take into account dbms requirements in their own development plans .
databases and dbmss can be categorized according to the database model ( s ) that they support ( such as relational or xml ) , the type ( s ) of computer they run on ( from a server cluster to a mobile phone ) , the query language ( s ) used to access the database ( such as sql or xquery ) , and their internal engineering , which affects performance , scalability , resilience , and security .
the sizes , capabilities , and performance of databases and their respective dbmss have grown in orders of magnitude .
these performance increases were enabled by the technology progress in the areas of processors , computer memory , computer storage , and computer networks .
the development of database technology can be divided into three eras based on data model or structure : navigational , sql / relational , and post-relational .
the two main early navigational data models were the hierarchical model and the codasyl model ( network model ) the relational model , first proposed in *num* by edgar f .
codd , departed from this tradition by insisting that applications should search for data by content , rather than by following links .
the relational model employs sets of ledger-style tables , each used for a different type of entity .
only in the mid-1980s did computing hardware become powerful enough to allow the wide deployment of relational systems ( dbmss plus applications ) .
by the early 1990s , however , relational systems dominated in all large-scale data processing applications , and they remain dominant : ibm db2 , oracle , mysql , and microsoft sql server are the most searched dbms .
the dominant database language , standardised sql for the relational model , has influenced database languages for other data models .
object databases were developed in the 1980s to overcome the inconvenience of object-relational impedance mismatch , which led to the coining of the term " post-relational " and also the development of hybrid object-relational databases .
the next generation of post-relational databases in the late 2000s became known as nosql databases , introducing fast key-value stores and document-oriented databases .
a competing " next generation " known as newsql databases attempted new implementations that retained the relational / sql model while aiming to match the high performance of nosql compared to commercially available relational dbmss .
the introduction of the term " database " coincided with the availability of direct-access storage ( disks and drums ) from the mid-1960s onwards .
the term represented a contrast with the tape-based systems of the past , allowing shared interactive use rather than daily batch processing .
the oxford english dictionary cites a *num* report by the system development corporation of california as the first to use the term " data-base " in a specific technical sense .
as computers grew in speed and capability , a number of general-purpose database systems emerged ; by the mid-1960s a number of such systems had come into commercial use .
interest in a standard began to grow , and charles bachman , author of one such product , the integrated data store ( ids ) , founded the " database task group " within codasyl , the group responsible for the creation and standardization of cobol .
in *num* , the database task group delivered their standard , which generally became known as the " codasyl approach " , and soon a number of commercial products based on this approach entered the market .
the codasyl approach relied on the " manual " navigation of a linked data set which was formed into a large network .
applications could find records by one of three methods : later systems added b-trees to provide alternate access paths .
many codasyl databases also added a very straightforward query language .
however , in the final tally , codasyl was very complex and required significant training and effort to produce useful applications .
ibm also had their own dbms in *num* , known as information management system ( ims ) .
ims was a development of software written for the apollo program on the system / *num* .
ims was generally similar in concept to codasyl , but used a strict hierarchy for its model of data navigation instead of codasyl's network model .
both concepts later became known as navigational databases due to the way data was accessed , and bachman's *num* turing award presentation was " the programmer as navigator " .
ims is classified as a hierarchical database .
idms and cincom systems ' total database are classified as network databases .
ims remains in use .
edgar codd worked at ibm in san jose , california , in one of their offshoot offices that was primarily involved in the development of hard disk systems .
he was unhappy with the navigational model of the codasyl approach , notably the lack of a " search " facility .
in *num* , he wrote a number of papers that outlined a new approach to database construction that eventually culminated in the groundbreaking " a relational model of data for large shared data banks " .
in this paper , he described a new system for storing and working with large databases .
instead of records being stored in some sort of linked list of free-form records as in codasyl , codd's idea was to use a " table " of fixed-length records , with each table used for a different type of entity .
a linked-list system would be very inefficient when storing " sparse " databases where some of the data for any one record could be left empty .
the relational model solved this by splitting the data into a series of normalized tables ( or " relations " ) , with optional elements being moved out of the main table to where they would take up room only if needed .
data may be freely inserted , deleted and edited in these tables , with the dbms doing whatever maintenance needed to present a table view to the application / user .
the relational model also allowed the content of the database to evolve without constant rewriting of links and pointers .
the relational part comes from entities referencing other entities in what is known as one-to-many relationship , like a traditional hierarchical model , and many-to-many relationship , like a navigational ( network ) model .
thus , a relational model can express both hierarchical and navigational models , as well as its native tabular model , allowing for pure or combined modeling in terms of these three models , as the application requires .
for instance , a common use of a database system is to track information about users , their name , login information , various addresses and phone numbers .
in the navigational approach , all of this data would be placed in a single record , and unused items would simply not be placed in the database .
in the relational approach , the data would be " normalized " into a user table , an address table and a phone number table ( for instance ) .
records would be created in these optional tables only if the address or phone numbers were actually provided .
linking the information back together is the key to this system .
in the relational model , some bit of information was used as a " key " , uniquely defining a particular record .
when information was being collected about a user , information stored in the optional tables would be found by searching for this key .
for instance , if the login name of a user is unique , addresses and phone numbers for that user would be recorded with the login name as its key .
this simple " re-linking " of related data back into a single collection is something that traditional computer languages are not designed for .
just as the navigational approach would require programs to loop in order to collect records , the relational approach would require loops to collect information about any " one " record .
codd's suggestions was a set-oriented language , that would later spawn the ubiquitous sql .
using a branch of mathematics known as tuple calculus , he demonstrated that such a system could support all the operations of normal databases ( inserting , updating etc .
) as well as providing a simple system for finding and returning " sets " of data in a single operation .
codd's paper was picked up by two people at berkeley , eugene wong and michael stonebraker .
they started a project known as ingres using funding that had already been allocated for a geographical database project and student programmers to produce code .
beginning in *num* , ingres delivered its first test products which were generally ready for widespread use in *num* .
ingres was similar to system r in a number of ways , including the use of a " language " for data access , known as quel .
over time , ingres moved to the emerging sql standard .
ibm itself did one test implementation of the relational model , prtv , and a production one , business system *num* , both now discontinued .
honeywell wrote mrds for multics , and now there are two new implementations : alphora dataphor and rel .
most other dbms implementations usually called " relational " are actually sql dbmss .
in *num* , the university of michigan began development of the micro information management system based on d .
l .
childs ' set-theoretic data model .
micro was used to manage very large data sets by the us department of labor , the u .
s .
environmental protection agency , and researchers from the university of alberta , the university of michigan , and wayne state university .
it ran on ibm mainframe computers using the michigan terminal system .
the system remained in production until *num* .
in the 1970s and 1980s , attempts were made to build database systems with integrated hardware and software .
the underlying philosophy was that such integration would provide higher performance at lower cost .
examples were ibm system / *num* , the early offering of teradata , and the britton lee , inc .
database machine .
another approach to hardware support for database management was icl's cafs accelerator , a hardware disk controller with programmable search capabilities .
in the long term , these efforts were generally unsuccessful because specialized database machines could not keep pace with the rapid development and progress of general-purpose computers .
thus most database systems nowadays are software systems running on general-purpose hardware , using general-purpose computer data storage .
however this idea is still pursued for certain applications by some companies like netezza and oracle ( exadata ) .
ibm started working on a prototype system loosely based on codd's concepts as " system r " in the early 1970s .
the first version was ready in *num* / *num* , and work then started on multi-table systems in which the data could be split so that all of the data for a record ( some of which is optional ) did not have to be stored in a single large " chunk " .
subsequent multi-user versions were tested by customers in *num* and *num* , by which time a standardized query language – sql – had been added .
codd's ideas were establishing themselves as both workable and superior to codasyl , pushing ibm to develop a true production version of system r , known as " sql / ds " , and , later , " database *num* " ( db2 ) .
larry ellison's oracle database ( or more simply , oracle ) started from a different chain , based on ibm's papers on system r .
though oracle v1 implementations were completed in *num* , it wasn't until oracle version *num* when ellison beat ibm to market in *num* .
stonebraker went on to apply the lessons from ingres to develop a new database , postgres , which is now known as postgresql .
postgresql is often used for global mission critical applications ( the .
org and .
info domain name registries use it as their primary data store , as do many large companies and financial institutions ) .
in sweden , codd's paper was also read and mimer sql was developed from the mid-1970s at uppsala university .
in *num* , this project was consolidated into an independent enterprise .
another data model , the entity–relationship model , emerged in *num* and gained popularity for database design as it emphasized a more familiar description than the earlier relational model .
later on , entity–relationship constructs were retrofitted as a data modeling construct for the relational model , and the difference between the two have become irrelevant .
the 1980s ushered in the age of desktop computing .
the new computers empowered their users with spreadsheets like lotus 1-2-3 and database software like dbase .
the dbase product was lightweight and easy for any computer user to understand out of the box .
c .
wayne ratliff , the creator of dbase , stated : " dbase was different from programs like basic , c , fortran , and cobol in that a lot of the dirty work had already been done .
the data manipulation is done by dbase instead of by the user , so the user can concentrate on what he is doing , rather than having to mess with the dirty details of opening , reading , and closing files , and managing space allocation .
" dbase was one of the top selling software titles in the 1980s and early 1990s .
the 1990s , along with a rise in object-oriented programming , saw a growth in how data in various databases were handled .
programmers and designers began to treat the data in their databases as objects .
that is to say that if a person's data were in a database , that person's attributes , such as their address , phone number , and age , were now considered to belong to that person instead of being extraneous data .
this allows for relations between data to be relations to objects and their attributes and not to individual fields .
the term " object-relational impedance mismatch " described the inconvenience of translating between programmed objects and database tables .
object databases and object-relational databases attempt to solve this problem by providing an object-oriented language ( sometimes as extensions to sql ) that programmers can use as alternative to purely relational sql .
on the programming side , libraries known as object-relational mappings ( orms ) attempt to solve the same problem .
xml databases are a type of structured document-oriented database that allows querying based on xml document attributes .
xml databases are mostly used in applications where the data is conveniently viewed as a collection of documents , with a structure that can vary from the very flexible to the highly rigid : examples include scientific articles , patents , tax filings , and personnel records .
nosql databases are often very fast , do not require fixed table schemas , avoid join operations by storing denormalized data , and are designed to scale horizontally .
in recent years , there has been a strong demand for massively distributed databases with high partition tolerance , but according to the cap theorem it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide consistency , availability , and partition tolerance guarantees .
a distributed system can satisfy any two of these guarantees at the same time , but not all three .
for that reason , many nosql databases are using what is called eventual consistency to provide both availability and partition tolerance guarantees with a reduced level of data consistency .
newsql is a class of modern relational databases that aims to provide the same scalable performance of nosql systems for online transaction processing ( read-write ) workloads while still using sql and maintaining the acid guarantees of a traditional database system .
databases are used to support internal operations of organizations and to underpin online interactions with customers and suppliers ( see enterprise software ) .
databases are used to hold administrative information and more specialized data , such as engineering data or economic models .
examples include computerized library systems , flight reservation systems , computerized parts inventory systems , and many content management systems that store websites as collections of webpages in a database .
one way to classify databases involves the type of their contents , for example : bibliographic , document-text , statistical , or multimedia objects .
another way is by their application area , for example : accounting , music compositions , movies , banking , manufacturing , or insurance .
a third way is by some technical aspect , such as the database structure or interface type .
this section lists a few of the adjectives used to characterize different kinds of databases .
connolly and begg define database management system ( dbms ) as a " software system that enables users to define , create , maintain and control access to the database " .
the dbms acronym is sometime extended to indicated the underlying database model , with rdbms for relational , oodbms or ordbms for the object ( orientated ) model and ordbms for object-relational .
other extensions can indicate some other characteristic , such as ddbms for a distributed database management systems .
the functionality provided by a dbms can vary enormously .
the core functionality is the storage , retrieval and update of data .
codd proposed the following functions and services a fully-fledged general purpose dbms should provide : it is also generally to be expected the dbms will provide a set of utilities for such purposes as may be necessary to administer the database effectively , including import , export , monitoring , defragmentation and analysis utilities .
the core part of the dbms interacting between the database and the application interface sometimes referred to as the database engine .
often dbmss will have configuration parameters that can be statically and dynamically tuned , for example the maximum amount of main memory on a server the database can use .
the trend is to minimise the amount of manual configuration , and for cases such as embedded databases the need to target zero-administration is paramount .
the large major enterprise dbmss have tended to increase in size and functionality and can have involved thousands of human years of development effort through their lifetime .
early multi-user dbms typically only allowed for the application to reside on the same computer with access via terminals or terminal emulation software .
the client–server architecture was a development where the application resided on a client desktop and the database on a server allowing the processing to be distributed .
this evolved into a multitier architecture incorporating application servers and web servers with the end user interface via a web browser with the database only directly connected to the adjacent tier .
a general-purpose dbms will provide public application programming interfaces ( api ) and optionally a processor for database languages such as sql to allow applications to be written to interact with the database .
a special purpose dbms may use a private api and be specifically customised and linked to a single application .
for example an email system performing many of the functions of a general-purpose dbms such as message insertion , message deletion , attachment handling , blocklist lookup , associating messages an email address and so forth however these functions are limited to what is required to handle email .
external interaction with the database will be via an application program that interfaces with the dbms .
this can range from a database tool that allows users to execute sql queries textually or graphically , to a web site that happens to use a database to store and search information .
a programmer will code interactions to the database ( sometimes referred to as a datasource ) via an application program interface ( api ) or via a database language .
the particular api or language chosen will need to be supported by dbms , possible indirectly via a pre-processor or a bridging api .
some api's aim to be database independent , odbc being a commonly known example .
other common api's include jdbc and ado .
net .
database languages are special-purpose languages , which allow one or more of the following tasks , sometimes distinguished as sublanguages : database languages are specific to a particular data model .
notable examples include : a database language may also incorporate features like : database storage is the container of the physical materialization of a database .
it comprises the " internal " ( physical ) " level " in the database architecture .
it also contains all the information needed ( e .
g .
, metadata , " data about the data " , and internal data structures ) to reconstruct the " conceptual level " and " external level " from the internal level when needed .
putting data into permanent storage is generally the responsibility of the database engine a .
k .
a .
" storage engine " .
though typically accessed by a dbms through the underlying operating system ( and often using the operating systems ' file systems as intermediates for storage layout ) , storage properties and configuration setting are extremely important for the efficient operation of the dbms , and thus are closely maintained by database administrators .
a dbms , while in operation , always has its database residing in several types of storage ( e .
g .
, memory and external storage ) .
the database data and the additional needed information , possibly in very large amounts , are coded into bits .
data typically reside in the storage in structures that look completely different from the way the data look in the conceptual and external levels , but in ways that attempt to optimize ( the best possible ) these levels ' reconstruction when needed by users and programs , as well as for computing additional types of needed information from the data ( e .
g .
, when querying the database ) .
some dbmss support specifying which character encoding was used to store data , so multiple encodings can be used in the same database .
various low-level database storage structures are used by the storage engine to serialize the data model so it can be written to the medium of choice .
techniques such as indexing may be used to improve performance .
conventional storage is row-oriented , but there are also column-oriented and correlation databases .
often storage redundancy is employed to increase performance .
a common example is storing " materialized views " , which consist of frequently needed " external views " or query results .
storing such views saves the expensive computing of them each time they are needed .
the downsides of materialized views are the overhead incurred when updating them to keep them synchronized with their original updated database data , and the cost of storage redundancy .
occasionally a database employs storage redundancy by database objects replication ( with one or more copies ) to increase data availability ( both to improve performance of simultaneous multiple end-user accesses to a same database object , and to provide resiliency in a case of partial failure of a distributed database ) .
updates of a replicated object need to be synchronized across the object copies .
in many cases , the entire database is replicated .
database security deals with all various aspects of protecting the database content , its owners , and its users .
it ranges from protection from intentional unauthorized database uses to unintentional database accesses by unauthorized entities ( e .
g .
, a person or a computer program ) .
database access control deals with controlling who ( a person or a certain computer program ) is allowed to access what information in the database .
the information may comprise specific database objects ( e .
g .
, record types , specific records , data structures ) , certain computations over certain objects ( e .
g .
, query types , or specific queries ) , or using specific access paths to the former ( e .
g .
, using specific indexes or other data structures to access information ) .
database access controls are set by special authorized ( by the database owner ) personnel that uses dedicated protected security dbms interfaces .
this may be managed directly on an individual basis , or by the assignment of individuals and privileges to groups , or ( in the most elaborate models ) through the assignment of individuals and groups to roles which are then granted entitlements .
data security prevents unauthorized users from viewing or updating the database .
using passwords , users are allowed access to the entire database or subsets of it called " subschemas " .
for example , an employee database can contain all the data about an individual employee , but one group of users may be authorized to view only payroll data , while others are allowed access to only work history and medical data .
if the dbms provides a way to interactively enter and update the database , as well as interrogate it , this capability allows for managing personal databases .
data security in general deals with protecting specific chunks of data , both physically ( i .
e .
, from corruption , or destruction , or removal ; e .
g .
, see physical security ) , or the interpretation of them , or parts of them to meaningful information ( e .
g .
, by looking at the strings of bits that they comprise , concluding specific valid credit-card numbers ; e .
g .
, see data encryption ) .
change and access logging records who accessed which attributes , what was changed , and when it was changed .
logging services allow for a forensic database audit later by keeping a record of access occurrences and changes .
sometimes application-level code is used to record changes rather than leaving this to the database .
monitoring can be set up to attempt to detect security breaches .
database transactions can be used to introduce some level of fault tolerance and data integrity after recovery from a crash .
a database transaction is a unit of work , typically encapsulating a number of operations over a database ( e .
g .
, reading a database object , writing , acquiring lock , etc .
) , an abstraction supported in database and also other systems .
each transaction has well defined boundaries in terms of which program / code executions are included in that transaction ( determined by the transaction's programmer via special transaction commands ) .
the acronym acid describes some ideal properties of a database transaction : atomicity , consistency , isolation , and durability .
a database built with one dbms is not portable to another dbms ( i .
e .
, the other dbms cannot run it ) .
however , in some situations , it is desirable to move , migrate a database from one dbms to another .
the reasons are primarily economical ( different dbmss may have different total costs of ownership or tcos ) , functional , and operational ( different dbmss may have different capabilities ) .
the migration involves the database's transformation from one dbms type to another .
the transformation should maintain ( if possible ) the database related application ( i .
e .
, all related application programs ) intact .
thus , the database's conceptual and external architectural levels should be maintained in the transformation .
it may be desired that also some aspects of the architecture internal level are maintained .
a complex or large database migration may be a complicated and costly ( one-time ) project by itself , which should be factored into the decision to migrate .
this in spite of the fact that tools may exist to help migration between specific dbmss .
typically , a dbms vendor provides tools to help importing databases from other popular dbmss .
after designing a database for an application , the next stage is building the database .
typically , an appropriate general-purpose dbms can be selected to be used for this purpose .
a dbms provides the needed user interfaces to be used by database administrators to define the needed application's data structures within the dbms's respective data model .
other user interfaces are used to select needed dbms parameters ( like security related , storage allocation parameters , etc .
) .
when the database is ready ( all its data structures and other needed components are defined ) , it is typically populated with initial application's data ( database initialization , which is typically a distinct project ; in many cases using specialized dbms interfaces that support bulk insertion ) before making it operational .
in some cases , the database becomes operational while empty of application data , and data are accumulated during its operation .
after the database is created , initialised and populated it needs to be maintained .
various database parameters may need changing and the database may need to be tuned ( tuning ) for better performance ; application's data structures may be changed or added , new related application programs may be written to add to the application's functionality , etc .
sometimes it is desired to bring a database back to a previous state ( for many reasons , e .
g .
, cases when the database is found corrupted due to a software error , or if it has been updated with erroneous data ) .
to achieve this , a backup operation is done occasionally or continuously , where each desired database state ( i .
e .
, the values of its data and their embedding in database's data structures ) is kept within dedicated backup files ( many techniques exist to do this effectively ) .
when this state is needed , i .
e .
, when it is decided by a database administrator to bring the database back to this state ( e .
g .
, by specifying this state by a desired point in time when the database was in this state ) , these files are used to restore that state .
static analysis techniques for software verification can be applied also in the scenario of query languages .
in particular , the *abstract interpretation framework has been extended to the field of query languages for relational databases as a way to support sound approximation techniques .
the semantics of query languages can be tuned according to suitable abstractions of the concrete domain of data .
the abstraction of relational database system has many interesting applications , in particular , for security purposes , such as fine grained access control , watermarking , etc .
other dbms features might include : increasingly , there are calls for a single system that incorporates all of these core functionalities into the same build , test , and deployment framework for database management and source control .
borrowing from other developments in the software industry , some market such offerings as " devops for database " .
the first task of a database designer is to produce a conceptual data model that reflects the structure of the information to be held in the database .
a common approach to this is to develop an entity-relationship model , often with the aid of drawing tools .
another popular approach is the unified modeling language .
a successful data model will accurately reflect the possible state of the external world being modeled : for example , if people can have more than one phone number , it will allow this information to be captured .
designing a good conceptual data model requires a good understanding of the application domain ; it typically involves asking deep questions about the things of interest to an organization , like " can a customer also be a supplier ? " , or " if a product is sold with two different forms of packaging , are those the same product or different products ? " , or " if a plane flies from new york to dubai via frankfurt , is that one flight or two ( or maybe even three ) ? " .
the answers to these questions establish definitions of the terminology used for entities ( customers , products , flights , flight segments ) and their relationships and attributes .
producing the conceptual data model sometimes involves input from business processes , or the analysis of workflow in the organization .
this can help to establish what information is needed in the database , and what can be left out .
for example , it can help when deciding whether the database needs to hold historic data as well as current data .
having produced a conceptual data model that users are happy with , the next stage is to translate this into a schema that implements the relevant data structures within the database .
this process is often called logical database design , and the output is a logical data model expressed in the form of a schema .
whereas the conceptual data model is ( in theory at least ) independent of the choice of database technology , the logical data model will be expressed in terms of a particular database model supported by the chosen dbms .
( the terms " data model " and " database model " are often used interchangeably , but in this article we use " data model " for the design of a specific database , and " database model " for the modeling notation used to express that design .
) the most popular database model for general-purpose databases is the relational model , or more precisely , the relational model as represented by the sql language .
the process of creating a logical database design using this model uses a methodical approach known as normalization .
the goal of normalization is to ensure that each elementary " fact " is only recorded in one place , so that insertions , updates , and deletions automatically maintain consistency .
the final stage of database design is to make the decisions that affect performance , scalability , recovery , security , and the like , which depend on the particular dbms .
this is often called " physical database design " , and the output is the physical data model .
a key goal during this stage is data independence , meaning that the decisions made for performance optimization purposes should be invisible to end-users and applications .
there are two types of data independence : physical data independence and logical data independence .
physical design is driven mainly by performance requirements , and requires a good knowledge of the expected workload and access patterns , and a deep understanding of the features offered by the chosen dbms .
another aspect of physical database design is security .
it involves both defining access control to database objects as well as defining security levels and methods for the data itself .
a database model is a type of data model that determines the logical structure of a database and fundamentally determines in which manner data can be stored , organized , and manipulated .
the most popular example of a database model is the relational model ( or the sql approximation of relational ) , which uses a table-based format .
common logical data models for databases include : an object-relational database combines the two related structures .
physical data models include : other models include : specialized models are optimized for particular types of data : a database management system provides three views of the database data : while there is typically only one conceptual ( or logical ) and physical ( or internal ) view of the data , there can be any number of different external views .
this allows users to see database information in a more business-related way rather than from a technical , processing viewpoint .
for example , a financial department of a company needs the payment details of all employees as part of the company's expenses , but does not need details about employees that are the interest of the human resources department .
thus different departments need different " views " of the company's database .
the three-level database architecture relates to the concept of " data independence " which was one of the major initial driving forces of the relational model .
the idea is that changes made at a certain level do not affect the view at a higher level .
for example , changes in the internal level do not affect application programs written using conceptual level interfaces , which reduces the impact of making physical changes to improve performance .
the conceptual view provides a level of indirection between internal and external .
on one hand it provides a common view of the database , independent of different external view structures , and on the other hand it abstracts away details of how the data are stored or managed ( internal level ) .
in principle every level , and even every external view , can be presented by a different data model .
in practice usually a given dbms uses the same data model for both the external and the conceptual levels ( e .
g .
, relational model ) .
the internal level , which is hidden inside the dbms and depends on its implementation , requires a different level of detail and uses its own types of data structure types .
separating the " external " , " conceptual " and " internal " levels was a major feature of the relational database model implementations that dominate *ord* century databases .
database technology has been an active research topic since the 1960s , both in academia and in the research and development groups of companies ( for example ibm research ) .
research activity includes theory and development of prototypes .
notable research topics have included models , the atomic transaction concept , and related concurrency control techniques , query languages and query optimization methods , raid , and more .
the database research area has several dedicated academic journals ( for example , " acm transactions on database systems"-tods , " data and knowledge engineering"-dke ) and annual conferences ( e .

antiprism in geometry , an " n"-sided antiprism is a polyhedron composed of two parallel copies of some particular " n"-sided polygon , connected by an alternating band of triangles .
antiprisms are a subclass of the prismatoids and are a ( degenerate ) type of snub polyhedra .
antiprisms are similar to prisms except the bases are twisted relative to each other , and that the side faces are triangles , rather than quadrilaterals .
in the case of a regular " n"-sided base , one usually considers the case where its copy is twisted by an angle .
extra regularity is obtained when the line connecting the base centers is perpendicular to the base planes , making it a right antiprism .
as faces , it has the two " n"-gonal bases and , connecting those bases , 2"n " isosceles triangles .
a uniform antiprism has , apart from the base faces , 2"n " equilateral triangles as faces .
as a class , the uniform antiprisms form an infinite series of vertex-uniform polyhedra , as do the uniform prisms .
for we have as degenerate case the regular tetrahedron as a " digonal antiprism " , and for the non-degenerate regular octahedron as a " triangular antiprism " .
the dual polyhedra of the antiprisms are the trapezohedra .
their existence was discussed and their name was coined by johannes kepler , though it is possible that they were previously known to archimedes as they satisfy the same conditions on vertices as the archimedean solids .
cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a right antiprism with " n"-gonal bases and isosceles triangles are with " k " ranging from *num* to 2"n" − *num* ; if the triangles are equilateral , let " a " be the edge-length of a uniform antiprism .
then the volume is and the surface area is there are an infinite set of truncated antiprisms , including a lower-symmetry form of the truncated octahedron ( truncated triangular antiprism ) .
these can be alternated to create snub antiprisms , two of which are johnson solids , and the " snub triangular antiprism " is a lower symmetry form of the icosahedron .
the symmetry group of a right " n"-sided antiprism with regular base and isosceles side faces is d of order 4"n " , except in the case of a tetrahedron , which has the larger symmetry group t of order *num* , which has three versions of d as subgroups , and the octahedron , which has the larger symmetry group o of order *num* , which has four versions of d as subgroups .
the symmetry group contains inversion if and only if " n " is odd .
the rotation group is d of order 2"n " , except in the case of a tetrahedron , which has the larger rotation group t of order *num* , which has three versions of d as subgroups , and the octahedron , which has the larger rotation group o of order *num* , which has four versions of d as subgroups .
uniform star antiprisms are named by their star polygon bases , {"p" / "q"} , and exist in prograde and retrograde ( crossed ) solutions .
crossed forms have intersecting vertex figures , and are denoted by inverted fractions , " p" / ( " p" - "q " ) instead of " p" / "q " , e .
g .
*num* / *num* instead of *num* / *num* .
in the retrograde forms but not in the prograde forms , the triangles joining the star bases intersect the axis of rotational symmetry .
some retrograde star antiprisms with regular star polygon bases cannot be constructed with equal edge lengths , so are not uniform polyhedra .
star antiprism compounds also can be constructed where " p " and " q " have common factors ; thus a *num* / *num* antiprism is the compound of two *num* / *num* star antiprisms .

aragonese language aragonese ( ; " aragonés " in aragonese ) is a romance language spoken in several dialects by *num* , *num* to *num* , *num* people in the pyrenees valleys of aragon , spain , primarily in the comarcas of somontano de barbastro , jacetania , alto gállego , sobrarbe , and ribagorza / ribagorça .
it is the only modern language which survived from medieval navarro-aragonese in a form distinctly different from spanish .
informally known as " fabla " ( " talk " or " speech " ) , aragonese is also commonly referred to by the names of its local dialects such as " cheso " ( from valle de hecho ) or " patués " ( from the benasque valley ) .
aragonese , which developed in portions of the ebro basin , can be traced back to the high middle ages .
it spread throughout the pyrenees to areas where languages similar to basque were previously spoken .
the kingdom of aragon ( formed by the counties of aragon , sobrarbe and ribagorza ) expanded southward from the mountains , pushing the moors farther south in the " reconquista " and spreading the aragonese language .
the union of the catalan counties and the kingdom of aragon which formed the 12th-century crown of aragon did not merge the languages of the two territories ; catalan continued to be spoken in the east and navarro-aragonese in the west , with boundaries blurred by dialectal continuity .
the aragonese " reconquista " in the south ended with the cession of murcia by james i of aragon to the kingdom of castile as dowry for an aragonese princess .
the best-known proponent of the aragonese language was johan ferrandez d'heredia , the grand master of the knights hospitaller in rhodes at the end of the *ord* century .
he wrote an extensive catalog of works in aragonese and translated several works from greek into aragonese ( the first in medieval europe ) .
the spread of castilian ( spanish ) , the castilian origin of the trastámara dynasty , and the similarity between castilian ( spanish ) and aragonese facilitated the recession of the latter .
a turning point was the 15th-century coronation of the castilian ferdinand i of aragon , also known as ferdinand of antequera .
in the early *ord* century , after the defeat of the allies of aragon in the spanish sucession war , philip v ordered the prohibition of the aragonese language in the schools and the establishment of castilian ( spanish ) as the only official language in aragon .
this was ordered in the aragonese nueva planta decrees of *num* .
in recent times , aragonese was mostly regarded as a group of rural dialects of spanish .
compulsory education undermined its already weak position ; for example , pupils were punished for using it .
however , the *num* spanish transition to democracy heralded literary works and studies of the language .
aragonese is the native language of the aragonese mountain ranges of the pyrenees , in the " comarcas " of somontano , jacetania , sobrarbe , and ribagorza .
cities and towns in which aragonese is spoken are huesca , graus , monzón , barbastro , bielsa , chistén , fonz , echo , estadilla , benasque , campo , sabiñánigo , jaca , plan , ansó , ayerbe , broto , and el grado .
it is spoken as a second language by inhabitants of zaragoza , huesca , ejea de los caballeros , or teruel .
according to recent polls , there are about *num* , *num* speakers ( *num* ) including speakers living outside the native area .
in *num* , the languages act of aragon ( law *num* / *num* ) recognized the " native language , original and historic " of aragon .
the language received several linguistic rights , including its use in public administration .
this legislation was repealed by a new law in *num* ( law *num* / *num* ) .
aragonese has many historical traits in common with catalan .
some are conservative features that are also shared with the astur-leonese languages and galician-portuguese , where spanish innovated in ways that did not spread to nearby languages .
in *num* , the academia de l'aragonés ( founded in *num* ) established an orthographic standard to modernize medieval orthography and to make it more etymological .
the new orthography is used by the .
aragonese had two orthographic standards : during the *ord* century , aragonese moriscos wrote aljamiado texts ( romance texts in arabic writing ) , possibly because of their inability to write in arabic .
the language in these texts has a mixture of aragonese and castilian traits , and they are among the last known written examples of the aragonese formerly spoken in central and southern aragon .
aragonese grammar is similar to that of other iberian romance languages , such as spanish and catalan .
the definite article in aragonese has undergone dialect-related changes , with definite articles in old aragonese similar to their present spanish equivalents .
the most-widespread articles in aragonese are similar to those in galician and portuguese , since they lack the initial " l " : the second ( auxiliary ) article , after a vowel , is used with an " r " ( pronounced [ ɾ ] ) .
neighboring romance languages have influenced aragonese .
catalan and occitan influenced medieval aragonese , and the catalan influence continued under the crown of aragon in the ribagorçan dialect .
since the *ord* century , spanish has most influenced aragonese ; it was adopted throughout aragon as the first language , limiting aragonese to the northern region surrounding the pyrenees .
french has also influenced aragonese ; italian loanwords have entered through other languages ( such as catalan ) , and portuguese words have entered through spanish .
germanic words came with the conquest of the region by germanic peoples during the fifth century , and english has introduced a number of new words into the language .
words that were part of the latin second declension—as well as words that joined it later on—are usually masculine : words that were part of the latin first declension are usually feminine : some latin neuter plural nouns joined the first declension as singular feminine nouns : words ending in " -or " are feminine : the names of fruit trees usually end in " -era " ( a suffix derived from latin -aria ) and are usually feminine : the genders of river names vary : unlike most other ibero-romance varieties , aragonese has partitive and locative clitic pronouns derived from the latin " inde " and " ibi " : " en" / "ne " and " bi" / "i" / "ie " .
such pronouns are present in most major romance languages ( catalan " en " and " hi " , occitan " ne " and " i " , french " en " and " y " , and italian " ne " and " ci" / "vi " ) .
"en / ne " is used for : "bi / i / ie " is used for : aragonese was not written until the *ord* and *ord* centuries ; the history " liber regum " , " razón feita d'amor " , " libre dels tres reys d'orient " , and " vida de santa maría egipcíaca " date from this period , there is also an aragonese version of the chronicle of morea , differing also in its content and written in the late *ord* century called " libro de los fechos et conquistas del principado de la morea " .
since *num* , spanish was the cultural language of aragon ; many aragonese wrote in spanish , and during the *ord* century the argensola brothers went to castile to teach spanish .
aragonese became a popular village language .
during the *ord* century , popular literature in the language began to appear .
in a *num* huesca literary contest , aragonese poems were submitted by matías pradas , isabel de rodas and " fileno , montañés " .
the *ord* and *ord* centuries have seen a renaissance of aragonese literature in several dialects .
in *num* , braulio foz ' novel " vida de pedro saputo " was published in the almudévar ( southern ) dialect .
the *ord* century featured domingo miral's costumbrist comedies and veremundo méndez coarasa's poetry , both in hecho ( western ) aragonese ; cleto torrodellas ' poetry and tonón de baldomera's popular writings in the graus ( eastern ) dialect and arnal cavero's costumbrist stories and juana coscujuela ' novel " a lueca , historia d'una moceta d'o semontano " , also in the southern dialect .
the *num* aragonese law of languages stipulated that aragonese ( and catalan ) speakers had a right to the teaching of and in their own language .
following this , aragonese lessons started in schools in the academic year *num* / *num* .
it was originally taught as an extra-curricular , non-evaluable voluntary subject in four schools .
however , whilst legally schools can choose to use aragonese as the language of instruction , as of the academic year *num* / *num* , there are no recorded instances of this option being taken in primary or secondary education .
in fact , the only current scenario in which aragonese is used as the language of instruction is in the university course of aragonese philology , which is optional , taught over the summer and still only given in aragonese in some of the lectures .
in pre-school education , students , whose parents wish for them to be taught aragonese , receive between thirty minutes to one hour of aragonese lessons a week .
in the *num* / *num* academic year there were *num* students recorded in pre-school aragonese lessons .
the subject of aragonese now has a fully developed curriculum in primary education in aragon .
despite this , in academic year *num* / *num* there were only seven aragonese teachers in the region across both pre-primary and primary education and none hold permanent positions , whilst the number of primary education students receiving aragonese lessons was of *num* .
german language german ( ) is a west germanic language that is mainly spoken in central europe .
it is the most widely spoken and official or co-official language in germany , austria , switzerland , south tyrol ( italy ) , the german-speaking community of belgium , and liechtenstein .
it is also one of the three official languages of luxembourg and a co-official language in the opole voivodeship in poland .
the languages which are most similar to german are the other members of the west germanic language branch : afrikaans , dutch , english , the frisian languages , low german / low saxon , luxembourgish , and yiddish .
there are also strong similarities in vocabulary with danish , norwegian and swedish , although those belong to the north germanic group .
german is the second most widely spoken germanic language , after english .
one of the major languages of the world , german is the first language of almost *num* million people worldwide and the most widely spoken native language in the european union .
together with french , german is the second most commonly spoken foreign language in the eu after english , making it the second biggest language in the eu in terms of overall speakers .
german is also the second most widely taught foreign language in the eu after english at primary school level ( but third after english and french at lower secondary level ) , the fourth most widely taught non-english language in the us ( after spanish , french and american sign language ) , and the second most commonly used scientific language as well as the third most widely used language on websites after english and russian .
the german-speaking countries are ranked fifth in terms of annual publication of new books , with one tenth of all books ( including e-books ) in the world being published in the german language .
in the united kingdom , german and french are the most-sought after foreign languages for businesses ( with *num* % and *num* % of businesses identifying these two languages as the most useful , respectively ) .
german is an inflected language with four cases for nouns , pronouns and adjectives ( nominative , accusative , genitive , dative ) , three genders ( masculine , feminine , neuter ) , two numbers ( singular , plural ) , and strong and weak verbs .
german derives the majority of its vocabulary from the ancient germanic branch of the indo-european language family .
a portion of german words are derived from latin and greek , and fewer are borrowed from french and modern english .
with slightly different standardized variants ( german , austrian and swiss standard german ) , german is a pluricentric language .
it is also notable for its broad spectrum of dialects , with many unique varieties existing in europe and also other parts of the world .
due to the limited intelligibility between certain varieties and standard german , as well as the lack of an undisputed , scientific difference between a " dialect " and a " language " , some german varieties or dialect groups ( e .
g .
low german or plautdietsch ) are alternatively referred to as " languages " or " dialects " .
modern standard german is a west germanic language descended from the germanic branch of the indo-european languages .
the germanic languages are traditionally subdivided into three branches : north germanic , east germanic , and west germanic .
the first of these branches survives in modern danish , swedish , norwegian , faroese , and icelandic , all of which are descended from old norse .
the east germanic languages are now extinct , and the only historical member of this branch from which written texts survive is gothic .
the west germanic languages , however , have undergone extensive dialectal subdivision and are now represented in modern languages such as english , german , dutch , yiddish , afrikaans , and others .
within the west germanic language dialect continuum , the benrath and uerdingen lines ( running through düsseldorf-benrath and krefeld-uerdingen , respectively ) serve to distinguish the germanic dialects that were affected by the high german consonant shift ( south of benrath ) from those that were not ( north of uerdingen ) .
the various regional dialects spoken south of these lines are grouped as high german dialects " ( nos .
29–34 on the map ) " , while those spoken to the north comprise the low german / low saxon " ( nos .
19–24 ) " and low franconian " ( no .
*num* ) " dialects .
as members of the west germanic language family , high german , low german , and low franconian can be further distinguished historically as irminonic , ingvaeonic , and istvaeonic , respectively .
this classification indicates their historical descent from dialects spoken by the irminones ( also known as the elbe group ) , ingvaeones ( or north sea germanic group ) , and istvaeones ( or weser-rhine group ) .
standard german is based on thuringian-upper saxon dialects " ( no .
*num* on the map ) " , which are central german dialects " ( nos .
29–31 ) " , belonging to the irminonic high german dialect group " ( nos .
29–34 ) " .
german is therefore most closely related to the other languages based on high german dialects , such as luxembourgish ( based on central franconian dialects – " no .
*num* " ) , and yiddish .
also closely related to standard german are the upper german dialects spoken in the southern german-speaking countries , such as swiss german ( alemannic dialects – " no .
*num* " ) , and the various germanic dialects spoken in the french region of grand est , such as alsatian ( mainly alemannic , but also central- and upper franconian " ( no .
*num* ) " dialects ) and lorraine franconian ( central franconian – " no .
*num* " ) .
after these high german dialects , standard german is ( somewhat less closely ) related to languages based on low franconian dialects ( e .
g .
dutch and afrikaans ) or low german / low saxon dialects ( spoken in northern germany and southern denmark ) , neither of which underwent the high german consonant shift .
as has been noted , the former of these dialect types is istvaeonic and the latter ingvaeonic , whereas the high german dialects are all irminonic ; the differences between these languages and standard german are therefore considerable .
also related to german are the frisian languages—north frisian ( spoken in nordfriesland – " no .
*num* " ) , saterland frisian ( spoken in saterland – " no .
*num* " ) , and west frisian ( spoken in friesland – " no .
*num* " ) —as well as the anglic languages of english and scots .
these anglo-frisian dialects are all members of the ingvaeonic family of west germanic languages which did not take part in the high german consonant shift .
the history of the german language begins with the high german consonant shift during the migration period , which separated old high german ( ohg ) dialects from old saxon .
this sound shift involved a drastic change in the pronunciation of both voiced and voiceless stop consonants ( " b " , " d " , " g " , and " p " , " t " , " k " , respectively ) .
the primary effects of the shift were the following : while there is written evidence of the old high german language in several elder futhark inscriptions from as early as the *ord* century ad ( such as the pforzen buckle ) , the old high german period is generally seen as beginning with the " abrogans " ( written c .
765–775 ) , a latin-german glossary supplying over *num* , *num* ohg words with their latin equivalents .
following the " abrogans " the first coherent works written in ohg appear in the *ord* century , chief among them being the " muspilli " , the " merseburg charms " , and the " hildebrandslied " , as well as a number of other religious texts ( the " georgslied " , the " ludwigslied " , the " evangelienbuch " , and translated hymns and prayers ) .
the " muspilli " is a christian poem written in a bavarian dialect offering an account of the soul after the last judgment , and the " merseburg charms " are transcriptions of spells and charms from the pagan germanic tradition .
of particular interest to scholars , however , has been the " hildebrandslied " , a secular epic poem telling the tale of an estranged father and son unknowingly meeting each other in battle .
linguistically this text is highly interesting due to the mixed use of old saxon and old high german dialects in its composition .
the written works of this period stem mainly from the alamanni , bavarian , and thuringian groups , all belonging to the elbe germanic group ( irminones ) , which had settled in what is now southern-central germany and austria between the *ord* and *ord* centuries during the great migration .
in general , the surviving texts of ohg show a wide range of dialectal diversity with very little written uniformity .
the early written tradition of ohg survived mostly through monasteries and scriptoria as local translations of latin originals ; as a result , the surviving texts are written in highly disparate regional dialects and exhibit significant latin influence , particularly in vocabulary .
at this point monasteries , where most written works were produced , were dominated by latin , and german saw only occasional use in official and ecclesiastical writing .
the german language through the ohg period was still predominantly a spoken language , with a wide range of dialects and a much more extensive oral tradition than a written one .
having just emerged from the high german consonant shift , ohg was also a relatively new and volatile language still undergoing a number of phonetic , phonological , morphological , and syntactic changes .
the scarcity of written work , instability of the language , and widespread illiteracy of the time thus account for the lack of standardization up to the end of the ohg period in *num* .
while there is no complete agreement over the dates of the middle high german ( mhg ) period , it is generally seen as lasting from *num* to *num* .
this was a period of significant expansion of the geographical territory occupied by germanic tribes , and consequently of the number of german speakers .
whereas during the old high german period the germanic tribes extended only as far east as the elbe and saale rivers , the mhg period saw a number of these tribes expanding beyond this eastern boundary into slavic territory ( this is known as the " ostsiedlung " ) .
along with the increasing wealth and geographic extent of the germanic groups came greater use of german in the courts of nobles as the standard language of official proceedings and literature .
a clear example of this is the " mittelhochdeutsche dichtersprache " employed in the hohenstaufen court in swabia as a standardized supra-dialectal written language .
while these efforts were still regionally bound , german began to be used in place of latin for certain official purposes , leading to a greater need for regularity in written conventions .
while the major changes of the mhg period were socio-cultural , german was still undergoing significant linguistic changes in syntax , phonetics , and morphology as well ( e .
g .
diphthongization of certain vowel sounds : " hus " ( ohg " house " ) " →haus " ( mhg ) , and weakening of unstressed short vowels to schwa [ ə ] : " taga " ( ohg " days " ) →"tage " ( mhg ) ) .
a great wealth of texts survives from the mhg period .
significantly , among this repertoire are a number of impressive secular works , such as the " nibelungenlied " , an epic poem telling the story of the dragon-slayer siegfried ( c .
*ord* century ) , and the " iwein , " an arthurian verse poem by hartmann von aue ( c .
*num* ) , as well as several lyric poems and courtly romances such as " parzival " and " tristan " .
( also noteworthy is the " sachsenspiegel " , the first book of laws written in middle " low " german ( c .
*num* ) ) .
the abundance and especially the secular character of the literature of the mhg period demonstrate the beginnings of a standardized written form of german , as well as the desire of poets and authors to be understood by individuals on supra-dialectal terms .
the middle high german period is generally seen as ending with the decimation of the population of europe in the black death of 1346–1353 .
modern german begins with the early new high german ( enhg ) period , which the influential german philologist wilhelm scherer dates 1350–1650 , terminating with the end of the thirty years ' war .
this period saw the further displacement of latin by german as the primary language of courtly proceedings and , increasingly , of literature in the german states .
while these states were still under the control of the holy roman empire and far from any form of unification , the desire for a cohesive written language that would be understandable across the many german-speaking principalities and kingdoms was stronger than ever .
as a spoken language german remained highly fractured through this period with a vast number of often mutually-incomprehensible regional dialects being spoken throughout the german states ; the invention of the printing press c .
*num* and the publication of luther's vernacular translation of the bible in *num* , however , had an immense effect on standardizing german as a supra-dialectal written language .
the enhg period saw the rise of several important cross-regional forms of chancery german , one being " gemeine tiutsch , " used in the court of the holy roman emperor maximilian i , and the other being " meißner deutsch " , used in the electorate of saxony in the duchy of saxe-wittenberg .
alongside these courtly written standards , the invention of the printing press led to the development of a number of printers ' languages ( " druckersprachen " ) aimed at making printed material readable and understandable across as many diverse dialects of german as possible .
the greater ease of production and increased availability of written texts brought about increased standardization in the written form of the german language .
one of the central events in the development of enhg was the publication of luther's translation of the bible into german ( the new testament in *num* and the old testament , published in parts and completed in *num* ) .
luther based his translation primarily on the " meißner deutsch " of saxony , spending much time among the population of saxony researching the dialect so as to make the work as natural and accessible to german speakers as possible .
copies of luther's bible featured a long list of glosses for each region that translated words which were unknown in the region into the regional dialect .
concerning his translation method luther says the following : one who would talk german does not ask the latin how he shall do it ; he must ask the mother in the home , the children on the streets , the common man in the market-place and note carefully how they talk , then translate accordingly .
they will then understand what is said to them because it is german .
when christ says ' ex abundantia cordis os loquitur , ' i would translate , if i followed the papists , " aus dem überflusz des herzens redet der mund " .
but tell me is this talking german ? what german understands such stuff ? no , the mother in the home and the plain man would say , " wesz das herz voll ist , des gehet der mund über " .
with luther's rendering of the bible in the vernacular german asserted itself against the dominance of latin as a legitimate language for courtly , literary , and now ecclesiastical subject-matter .
further , his bible was ubiquitous in the german states with nearly every household possessing a copy .
nevertheless , even with the influence of luther's bible as an unofficial written standard , it was not until the middle of the *ord* century after the enhg period that a widely accepted standard for written german appeared .
german was the language of commerce and government in the habsburg empire , which encompassed a large area of central and eastern europe .
until the *ord* century , it was essentially the language of townspeople throughout most of the empire .
its use indicated that the speaker was a merchant or someone from an urban area , regardless of nationality .
some cities , such as prague ( ) and budapest ( buda , ) , were gradually germanized in the years after their incorporation into the habsburg domain .
others , such as pozsony ( , now bratislava ) , were originally settled during the habsburg period , and were primarily german at that time .
prague , budapest and bratislava as well as cities like zagreb ( ) , and ljubljana ( ) , contained significant german minorities .
in the eastern provinces of banat and transylvania ( ) , german was the predominant language not only in the larger towns – such as ( timișoara ) , ( sibiu ) and ( brașov ) – but also in many smaller localities in the surrounding areas .
the most comprehensive guide to the vocabulary of the german language is found within the .
this dictionary was created by the brothers grimm and is composed of *num* parts which were issued between *num* and *num* .
in *num* , grammatical and orthographic rules first appeared in the " duden handbook " .
in *num* , the *ord* orthographical conference ended with a complete standardization of the german language in its written form and the " duden handbook " was declared its standard definition .
the ( literally , german stage language ) had established conventions for german pronunciation in theatre ( bühnendeutsch ) three years earlier ; however , this was an artificial standard that did not correspond to any traditional spoken dialect .
rather , it was based on the pronunciation of standard german in northern germany , although it was subsequently regarded often as a general prescriptive norm , despite differing pronunciation traditions especially in the upper-german-speaking regions that still characterize the dialect of the area today – especially the pronunciation of the ending as [ ɪk ] instead of [ ɪç ] .
in northern germany , standard german was a foreign language to most inhabitants , whose native dialects were subsets of low german .
it was usually encountered only in writing or formal speech ; in fact , most of standard german was a written language , not identical to any spoken dialect , throughout the german-speaking area until well into the *ord* century .
official revisions of some of the rules from *num* were not issued until the controversial german orthography reform of *num* was made the official standard by governments of all german-speaking countries .
media and written works are now almost all produced in standard german ( often called , " high german " ) which is understood in all areas where german is spoken .
due to the german diaspora as well as german being the second most widely spoken language in europe and the third most widely taught foreign language in the us and the eu ( in upper secondary education ) amongst others , the geographical distribution of german speakers ( or " germanophones " ) spans all inhabited continents .
as for the number of speakers of any language worldwide , an assessment is always compromised by the lack of sufficient , reliable data .
for an exact , global number of native german speakers , this is further complicated by the existence of several varieties whose status as separate " languages " or " dialects " is disputed for political and / or linguistic reasons , including quantitatively strong varieties like certain forms of alemannic ( e .
g .
, alsatian ) and low german / plautdietsch .
mostly depending on the inclusion or exclusion of certain varieties , it is estimated that approximately 90–95 million people speak german as a first language , 10–25 million as a second language , and 75–100 million as a foreign language .
this would imply approximately 175–220 million german speakers worldwide .
it is estimated that also including all persons who are or were taking german classes , i .
e .
, regardless of their actual proficiency , would amount to about *num* million people worldwide with at least some knowledge of german .
in europe , german is the second most widely spoken mother tongue ( after russian ) and the second biggest language in terms of overall speakers ( after english ) .
the area in central europe where the majority of the population speaks german as a first language and has german as a ( co- ) official language is called the " german sprachraum " .
it comprises an estimated *num* million native speakers and *num* million who speak german as a second language ( e .
g .
immigrants ) .
excluding regional minority languages , german is the only official language of it is a co-official language of the although expulsions and ( forced ) assimilation after the two world wars greatly diminished them , minority communities of mostly bilingual german native speakers exist in areas both adjacent to and detached from the sprachraum .
within europe and asia , german is a recognized minority language in the following countries : in france , the high german varieties of alsatian and moselle franconian are identified as " regional languages " , but the european charter for regional and minority languages of *num* has not yet been ratified by the government .
in the netherlands , the limburgish , frisian , and low german languages are protected regional languages according to the european charter for regional and minority languages ; however , they are widely considered separate languages and neither german nor dutch dialects .
namibia was a colony of the german empire from *num* to *num* .
mostly descending from german settlers who immigrated during this time , 25–30 , *num* people still speak german as a native tongue today .
the period of german colonialism in namibia also led to the evolution of a standard german-based pidgin language called " namibian black german " , which became a second language for parts of the indigenous population .
although it is nearly extinct today , some older namibians still have some knowledge of it .
german , along with english and afrikaans was a co-official language of namibia from *num* until its independence from south africa in *num* .
at this point , the namibian government perceived afrikaans and german as symbols of apartheid and colonialism , and decided english would be the sole official language , claiming that it was a " neutral " language as there were virtually no english native speakers in namibia at that time .
german , afrikaans and several indigenous languages became " national languages " by law , identifying them as elements of the cultural heritage of the nation and ensuring that the state acknowledged and supported their presence in the country .
today , german is used in a wide variety of spheres , especially business and tourism , as well as the churches ( most notably the german-speaking evangelical lutheran church in namibia ( gelk ) ) , schools ( e .
g .
the ) , literature ( german-namibian authors include giselher w .
hoffmann ) , radio ( the namibian broadcasting corporation produces radio programs in german ) , and music ( e .
g .
artist ees ) .
the is one of the three biggest newspapers in namibia and the only german-language daily in africa .
mostly originating from different waves of immigration during the *ord* and *ord* centuries , an estimated *num* , *num* people speak german or a german variety as a first language in south africa .
one of the largest communities consists of the speakers of " " , a variety of low german , concentrated in and around wartburg .
the small town of kroondal in the north-west province also has a mostly german-speaking population .
the south african constitution identifies german as a " commonly used " language and the pan south african language board is obligated to promote and ensure respect for it .
the community is strong enough that several german international schools are supported such as the deutsche schule pretoria .
in the united states , the states of north dakota and south dakota are the only states where german is the most common language spoken at home after english .
german geographical names can be found throughout the midwest region of the country , such as new ulm and many other towns in minnesota ; bismarck ( north dakota's state capital ) , munich , karlsruhe , and strasburg ( named after a town near odessa in ukraine ) in north dakota ; new braunfels , fredericksburg , weimar , and muenster in texas ; corn ( formerly korn ) , kiefer and berlin in oklahoma ; and kiel , berlin , and germantown in wisconsin .
in brazil , the largest concentrations of german speakers are in the states of rio grande do sul ( where riograndenser hunsrückisch developed ) , santa catarina , paraná , são paulo and espírito santo .
there are also important concentrations of german-speaking descendants in argentina , chile , paraguay , venezuela , peru and bolivia .
the impact of *ord* century german immigration to southern chile was such that valdivia was for a while a spanish-german bilingual city with " "german signboards and placards alongside the spanish" " .
the prestige the german language made it acquire qualities of a superstratum in southern chile .
the word for blackberry , an ubiquituos plant in southern chile , is " murra " instead of the ordinary spanish word " mora " and " zarzamora " from valdivia to chiloé archipelago and some towns in aysén region .
the use of " rr " is an adaptation of guttural sounds found in german difficult to pronounce in spanish .
similarly the name for marbles , a traditional children's game , is different in southern chile compared to areas further north .
from valdivia to aysén region this game is called " bochas " contrary to the word " bolitas " used further north .
the word " bocha " is likely derivative of the germans " bocciaspiel " .
in australia , the state of south australia experienced a pronounced wave of immigration in the 1840s from prussia ( particularly the silesia region ) .
with the prolonged isolation from other german speakers and contact with australian english , a unique dialect known as barossa german has developed and is spoken predominantly in the barossa valley near adelaide .
usage of german sharply declined with the advent of world war i , due to the prevailing anti-german sentiment in the population and related government action .
it continued to be used as a first language into the twentieth century but now its use is limited to a few older speakers .
german migration to new zealand in the *ord* century was less pronounced than migration from britain , ireland , and perhaps even scandinavia .
despite this there were significant pockets of german-speaking communities which lasted until the first decades of the *ord* century .
german-speakers settled principally in puhoi , nelson , and gore .
at the last census ( *num* ) , *num* , *num* people in new zealand spoke german , making it the third most spoken european language after english and french and overall the ninth most spoken language .
there is also an important german creole being studied and recovered , named , spoken in the former german colony of german new guinea , across micronesia and in northern australia ( i .
e .
coastal parts of queensland and western australia ) , by a few elderly people .
the risk of its extinction is serious and efforts to revive interest in the language are being implemented by scholars .
like french and spanish , german has become a classic second foreign language in the western world , as english ( spanish in the us ) is well established as the first foreign language .
german ranks second ( after english ) among the best known foreign languages in the eu ( on a par with french ) as well as in russia .
in terms of student numbers across all levels of education , german ranks third in the eu ( after english and french ) as well as in the united states ( after spanish and french ) .
in *num* , approximately *num* .
*num* million people were in the process of learning german across all levels of education worldwide .
as this number remained relatively stable since *num* ( ± *num* million ) , roughly 75–100 million people able to communicate in german as foreign language can be inferred assuming an average course duration of three years and other estimated parameters .
according to a *num* survey , *num* million people within the eu ( i .
e .
, up to two thirds of the 75–100 million worldwide ) claimed to have sufficient german skills to have a conversation .
within the eu , not counting countries where it is an official language , german as a foreign language is most popular in eastern and northern europe , namely the czech republic , croatia , denmark , the netherlands , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , sweden and poland .
german was once and , to some extent , is still , a lingua franca in those parts of europe .
standard german originated not as a traditional dialect of a specific region but as a written language .
however , there are places where the traditional regional dialects have been replaced by new vernaculars based on standard german ; that is the case in large stretches of northern germany but also in major cities in other parts of the country .
it is important to note , however , that the colloquial standard german differs greatly from the formal written language , especially in grammar and syntax , in which it has been influenced by dialectal speech .
standard german differs regionally between german-speaking countries in vocabulary and some instances of pronunciation and even grammar and orthography .
this variation must not be confused with the variation of local dialects .
even though the regional varieties of standard german are only somewhat influenced by the local dialects , they are very distinct .
german is thus considered a pluricentric language .
in most regions , the speakers use a continuum from more dialectal varieties to more standard varieties according to circumstances .
in german linguistics , german dialects are distinguished from varieties of standard german .
the " varieties of standard german " refer to the different local varieties of the pluricentric standard german .
they differ only slightly in lexicon and phonology .
in certain regions , they have replaced the traditional german dialects , especially in northern germany .
in the german-speaking parts of switzerland , mixtures of dialect and standard are very seldom used , and the use of standard german is largely restricted to the written language , though about *num* % of the swiss residents speak " high german " ( aka standard german ) at home , but mainly due to german immigrants .
this situation has been called a " medial diglossia " .
swiss standard german is used in the swiss education system , whereas austrian standard german is officially used in the austrian education system .
a mixture of dialect and standard does not normally occur in northern germany either .
the traditional varieties there are low german , whereas standard german is a high german " variety " .
because their linguistic distance to it is greater , they do not mesh with standard german the way that high german dialects ( such as bavarian , swabian , hessian ) can .
german is a member of the west germanic language of the germanic family of languages , which in turn is part of the indo-european language family .
the german dialects are the traditional local varieties ; many of them are hardly understandable to someone who knows only standard german , and they have great differences in lexicon , phonology and syntax .
if a narrow definition of language based on mutual intelligibility is used , many german dialects are considered to be separate languages ( for instance in the ethnologue ) .
however , such a point of view is unusual in german linguistics .
the german dialect continuum is traditionally divided most broadly into high german and low german , also called low saxon .
however , historically , high german dialects and low saxon / low german dialects do not belong to the same language .
nevertheless , in today's germany , low saxon / low german is often perceived as a dialectal variation of standard german on a functional level even by many native speakers .
the same phenomenon is found in the eastern netherlands , as the traditional dialects are not always identified with their low saxon / low german origins , but with dutch .
the variation among the german dialects is considerable , with often only neighbouring dialects being mutually intelligible .
some dialects are not intelligible to people who know only standard german .
however , all german dialects belong to the dialect continuum of high german and low saxon .
middle low german was the lingua franca of the hanseatic league .
it was the predominant language in northern germany until the *ord* century .
in *num* , the luther bible was published .
the translation is considered to be an important step towards the evolution of the early new high german .
it aimed to be understandable to a broad audience and was based mainly on central and upper german varieties .
the early new high german language gained more prestige than low german and became the language of science and literature .
around the same time , the hanseatic league , based around northern ports , lost its importance as new trade routes to asia and the americas were established , and the most powerful german states of that period were located in middle and southern germany .
the *ord* and *ord* centuries were marked by mass education in standard german in schools .
gradually , low german came to be politically viewed as a mere dialect spoken by the uneducated .
today , low saxon can be divided in two groups : low saxon varieties with a reasonable standard german influx and varieties of standard german with a low saxon influence known as .
sometimes , low saxon and low franconian varieties are grouped together because both are unaffected by the high german consonant shift .
however , the proportion of the population who can understand and speak it has decreased continuously since world war ii .
the largest cities in the low german area are hamburg and dortmund .
the low franconian dialects are the dialects that are more closely related to dutch than to low german .
most of the low franconian dialects are spoken in the netherlands and in belgium , where they are considered as dialects of dutch , which is itself a low franconian language .
in germany , low franconian dialects are spoken in the northwest of north rhine-westphalia , along the lower rhine .
the low franconian dialects spoken in germany are referred to as meuse-rhenish or low rhenish .
in the north of the german low franconian language area , north low franconian dialects ( also referred to as cleverlands or as dialects of south guelderish ) are spoken .
these dialects are more closely related to dutch ( also north low franconian ) than the south low franconian dialects ( also referred to as east limburgish and , east of the rhine , bergish ) , which are spoken in the south of the german low franconian language area .
the south low franconian dialects are more closely related to limburgish than to dutch , and are transitional dialects between low franconian and ripuarian ( central franconian ) .
the east bergish dialects are the easternmost low franconian dialects , and are transitional dialects between north- and south low franconian , and westphalian ( low german ) , with most of its features however being north low franconian .
the largest cities in the german low franconian area are düsseldorf and duisburg .
the high german dialects consist of the central german , high franconian , and upper german dialects .
the high franconian dialects are transitional dialects between central- and upper german .
the high german varieties spoken by the ashkenazi jews have several unique features , and are considered as a separate language , yiddish , written with the hebrew alphabet .
the central german dialects are spoken in central germany , from aachen in the west to görlitz in the east .
they consist of franconian dialects in the west ( west central german ) , and non-franconian dialects in the east ( east central german ) .
modern standard german is mostly based on central german dialects .
the franconian , west central german dialects are the central franconian dialects ( ripuarian and moselle franconian ) , and the rhine franconian dialects ( hessian and palatine ) .
these dialects are considered as luxembourgish as well as the transylvanian saxon dialect spoken in transylvania are based on moselle franconian dialects .
the largest cities in the franconian central german area are cologne and frankfurt .
further east , the non-franconian , east central german dialects are spoken ( thuringian , upper saxon , ore mountainian , and lusatian-new markish , and earlier , in the then german-speaking parts of silesia also silesian , and in then german southern east prussia also high prussian ) .
the largest cities in the east central german area are berlin and leipzig .
the high franconian dialects are transitional dialects between central- and upper german .
they consist of the east- and south franconian dialects .
the east franconian dialect branch is one of the most spoken dialect branches in germany .
these dialects are spoken in the region of franconia and in the central parts of saxon vogtland .
franconia consists of the bavarian districts of upper- , middle- , and lower franconia , the region of south thuringia ( thuringia ) , and the eastern parts of the region of heilbronn-franken ( tauber franconia and hohenlohe ) in baden-württemberg .
the largest cities in the east franconian area are nuremberg and würzburg .
south franconian is mainly spoken in northern baden-württemberg in germany , but also in the northeasternmost part of the region of alsace in france .
while these dialects are considered as dialects of german in baden-württemberg , they are considered as dialects of alsatian in alsace ( most alsatian dialects are however low alemannic ) .
the largest cities in the south franconian area are karlsruhe and heilbronn .
the upper german dialects are the alemannic dialects in the west , and the bavarian dialects in the east .
alemannic dialects are spoken in switzerland ( high alemannic in the densely populated swiss plateau , in the south also highest alemannic , and low alemannic in basel ) , baden-württemberg ( swabian and low alemannic , in the southwest also high alemannic ) , bavarian swabia ( swabian , in the southwesternmost part also low alemannic ) , vorarlberg ( low- , high- , and highest alemannic ) , alsace ( low alemannic , in the southernmost part also high alemannic ) , liechtenstein ( high- and highest alemannic ) , and in the tyrolean district of reutte ( swabian ) .
the alemannic dialects are considered as alsatian in alsace .
the largest cities in the alemannic area are stuttgart and zürich .
bavarian dialects are spoken in austria ( vienna , lower- and upper austria , styria , carinthia , salzburg , burgenland , and in most parts of tyrol ) , bavaria ( upper- and lower bavaria as well as upper palatinate ) , south tyrol , southwesternmost saxony ( southern vogtlandian ) , and in the swiss village of samnaun .
the largest cities in the bavarian area are vienna and munich .
german is a fusional language with a moderate degree of inflection , with three grammatical genders ; as such , there can be a large number of words derived from the same root .
german nouns inflect by case , gender and number : this degree of inflection is considerably less than in old high german and other old indo-european languages such as latin , ancient greek and sanskrit , and it is also somewhat less than , for instance , old english , modern icelandic or russian .
the three genders have collapsed in the plural .
with four cases and three genders plus plural , there are *num* permutations of case and gender / number of the article ( not the nouns ) , but there are only six forms of the definite article , which together cover all *num* permutations .
in nouns , inflection for case is required in the singular for strong masculine and neuter nouns only in the genitive ( only in archaic use in the dative ) , and even this is losing ground to substitutes in informal speech .
the dative noun ending is considered archaic or at least old-fashioned in almost all contexts and is almost always dropped even in writing , except in proverbs and other petrified forms .
weak masculine nouns share a common case ending for genitive , dative and accusative in the singular .
feminine nouns are not declined in the singular .
the plural has an inflection for the dative .
in total , seven inflectional endings ( not counting plural markers ) exist in german : .
in german orthography , nouns and most words with the syntactical function of nouns are capitalised to make it easier for readers to determine the function of a word within a sentence ( – " on friday i went shopping .
" ; – " one day he finally showed up .
" ) this convention is almost unique to german today ( shared perhaps only by the closely related luxembourgish language and several insular dialects of the north frisian language ) , but it was historically common in other languages such as danish ( which abolished the capitalization of nouns in *num* ) and english .
like the other germanic languages , german forms noun compounds in which the first noun modifies the category given by the second , : ( " dog hut " ; specifically : " dog kennel " ) .
unlike english , whose newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written in " open " with separating spaces , german ( like some other germanic languages ) nearly always uses the " closed " form without spaces , for example : ( " tree house " ) .
like english , german allows arbitrarily long compounds in theory ( see also english compounds ) .
the longest german word verified to be actually in ( albeit very limited ) use is , which , literally translated , is " beef labelling supervision duty assignment law " [ from ( cattle ) , ( meat ) , ( labelling ) , ( supervision ) , ( duties ) , ( assignment ) , ( law ) ] .
however , examples like this are perceived by native speakers as excessively bureaucratic , stylistically awkward or even satirical .
the inflection of standard german verbs includes : the meaning of basic verbs can be expanded and sometimes radically changed through the use of a number of prefixes .
some prefixes have a specific meaning ; the prefix ' refers to destruction , as in ( to tear apart ) , ( to break apart ) , ( to cut apart ) .
other prefixes have only the vaguest meaning in themselves ; ' is found in a number of verbs with a large variety of meanings , as in ( to try ) from ( to seek ) , ( to interrogate ) from ( to take ) , ( to distribute ) from ( to share ) , ( to understand ) from ( to stand ) .
other examples include the following : many german verbs have a separable prefix , often with an adverbial function .
in finite verb forms , it is split off and moved to the end of the clause and is hence considered by some to be a " resultative particle " .
for example , , meaning " to go along " , would be split , giving ( literal : " go you with ? " ; idiomatic : " are you going along ? " ) .
indeed , several parenthetical clauses may occur between the prefix of a finite verb and its complement ( ankommen = to arrive , er kam an = he arrived , er ist angekommen = he has arrived ) : a selectively literal translation of this example to illustrate the point might look like this : german word order is generally with the v2 word order restriction and also with the sov word order restriction for main clauses .
for polar questions , exclamations and wishes , the finite verb always has the first position .
in subordinate clauses , the verb occurs at the very end .
german requires for a verbal element ( main verb or auxiliary verb ) to appear second in the sentence .
the verb is preceded by the topic of the sentence .
the element in focus appears at the end of the sentence .
for a sentence without an auxiliary , these are some possibilities : the position of a noun in a german sentence has no bearing on its being a subject , an object or another argument .
in a declarative sentence in english , if the subject does not occur before the predicate , the sentence could well be misunderstood .
however , german's flexibile word order allows one to emphasise specific words : normal word order : object in front : adverb of time in front : both time expressions in front : another possibility : swapped adverbs : swapped object : the flexible word order also allows one to use language " tools " ( such as poetic meter and figures of speech ) more freely .
when an auxiliary verb is present , it appears in second position , and the main verb appears at the end .
this occurs notably in the creation of the perfect tense .
many word orders are still possible : the main verb may appear in first position to put stress on the action itself .
the auxiliary verb is still in second position .
sentences using modal verbs place the infinitive at the end .
for example , the english sentence " should he go home ? " would be rearranged in german to say " should he ( to ) home go ? " ( ) .
thus , in sentences with several subordinate or relative clauses , the infinitives are clustered at the end .
compare the similar clustering of prepositions in the following ( highly contrived ) english sentence : " what did you bring that book that i do not like to be read to out of up for ? " german subordinate clauses have all verbs clustered at the end .
given that auxiliaries encode future , passive , modality , and the perfect , very long chains of verbs at the end of the sentence can occur .
in these constructions , the past participle in is often replaced by the infinitive .
the order at the end of such strings is subject to variation , but the latter version is unusual .
most german vocabulary is derived from the germanic branch of the european language family .
however , there is a significant amount of loanwords from other languages , in particular from latin , greek , italian , french and most recently english .
in the early *ord* century , joachim heinrich campe estimated that one fifth of the total german vocabulary was of french or latin origin .
latin words were already imported into the predecessor of the german language during the roman empire and underwent all the characteristic phonetic changes in german .
their origin is thus no longer recognizable for most speakers ( e .
g .
, , , , from latin , , , , ) .
borrowing from latin continued after the fall of the roman empire during christianization , mediated by the church and monasteries .
another important influx of latin words can be observed during renaissance humanism .
in a scholarly context , the borrowings from latin have continued until today , in the last few decades often indirectly through borrowings from english .
during the *ord* to *ord* centuries , the influence of italian was great , leading to many italian loanwords in the fields of architecture , finance , and music .
the influence of the french language in the *ord* to *ord* centuries resulted in an even greater import of french words .
the english influence was already present in the *ord* century , but it did not become dominant until the second half of the *ord* century .
at the same time , the effectiveness of the german language in forming equivalents for foreign words from its inherited germanic stem repertory is great .
thus , notker labeo was able to translate aristotelian treatises in pure ( old high ) german in the decades after the year *num* .
the tradition of loan translation was revitalized in the *ord* century , with linguists like joachim heinrich campe , who introduced close to *num* words that are still used in modern german .
even today , there are movements that try to promote the ( substitution ) of foreign words deemed unnecessary with german alternatives .
it is claimed that this would also help in spreading modern or scientific notions among the less educated and as well democratise public life .
as in english , there are many pairs of synonyms due to the enrichment of the germanic vocabulary with loanwords from latin and latinized greek .
these words often have different connotations from their germanic counterparts and are usually perceived as more scholarly .
the size of the vocabulary of german is difficult to estimate .
the ( " the german dictionary " ) initiated by jacob and wilhelm grimm already contained over *num* , *num* headwords in its first edition .
the modern german scientific vocabulary is estimated at nine million words and word groups ( based on the analysis of *num* million sentences of a corpus in leipzig , which as of july *num* included *num* million words in total ) .
the duden is the " de facto " official dictionary of the german language , first published by konrad duden in *num* .
the duden is updated regularly , with new editions appearing every four or five years .
, it is in its *ord* edition and in *num* volumes , each covering different aspects such as loanwords , etymology , pronunciation , synonyms , and so forth .
the first of these volumes , ( german orthography ) , has long been the prescriptive source for the spelling of german .
the " duden " has become the bible of the german language , being the definitive set of rules regarding grammar , spelling and usage of german .
the ( " austrian dictionary " ) , abbreviated , is the official dictionary of the german language in the republic of austria .
it is edited by a group of linguists under the authority of the austrian federal ministry of education , arts and culture ( ) .
it is the austrian counterpart to the german " duden " and contains a number of terms unique to austrian german or more frequently used or differently pronounced there .
a considerable amount of this " austrian " vocabulary is also common in southern germany , especially bavaria , and some of it is used in switzerland as well .
the most recent edition is the *ord* from *num* .
since the *ord* edition from *num* the orthography of the was adjusted to the german spelling reform of *num* .
the dictionary is also officially used in the italian province of south tyrol .
this is a selection of cognates in both english and german .
instead of the usual infinitive ending " -en " german verbs are indicated by a hyphen " - " after their stems .
words that are written with capital letters in german are nouns .
german is written in the latin alphabet .
in addition to the *num* standard letters , german has three vowels with umlaut , namely " ä " , " ö " and " ü " , as well as the eszett or ( sharp s ) : " ß " .
in switzerland and liechtenstein , " ss " is used instead of " ß " .
since " ß " can never occur at the beginning of a word , it has no traditional uppercase form .
written texts in german are easily recognisable as such by distinguishing features such as umlauts and certain orthographical features – german is the only major language that capitalizes all nouns , a relic of a widespread practice in northern europe in the early modern era ( including english for a while , in the 1700s ) – and the frequent occurrence of long compounds .
the longest german word that has been published is made of *num* characters .
because legibility and convenience set certain boundaries , compounds consisting of more than three or four nouns are almost exclusively found in humorous contexts .
( in contrast , although english can also string nouns together , it usually separates the nouns with spaces .
for example , " toilet bowl cleaner " .
) before the german orthography reform of *num* , " ß " replaced " ss " after long vowels and diphthongs and before consonants , word- , or partial-word-endings .
in reformed spelling , " ß " replaces " ss " only after long vowels and diphthongs .
since there is no traditional capital form of " ß " , it was replaced by " ss " when capitalization was required .
for example , ( tape measure ) became in capitals .
an exception was the use of ß in legal documents and forms when capitalizing names .
to avoid confusion with similar names , lower case " ß " was maintained ( so , " " instead of " " ) .
capital ß ( ß ) was ultimately adopted into german orthography in *num* , ending a long orthographic debate .
umlaut vowels ( ä , ö , ü ) are commonly transcribed with ae , oe , and ue if the umlauts are not available on the keyboard or other medium used .
in the same manner ß can be transcribed as ss .
some operating systems use key sequences to extend the set of possible characters to include , amongst other things , umlauts ; in microsoft windows this is done using alt codes .
german readers understand these transcriptions ( although they appear unusual ) , but they are avoided if the regular umlauts are available because they are a makeshift , not proper spelling .
( in westphalia and schleswig-holstein , city and family names exist where the extra e has a vowel lengthening effect , e .
g .
" raesfeld " , " coesfeld " and " itzehoe " , but this use of the letter e after a / o / u does not occur in the present-day spelling of words other than proper nouns .
) there is no general agreement on where letters with umlauts occur in the sorting sequence .
telephone directories treat them by replacing them with the base vowel followed by an e .
some dictionaries sort each umlauted vowel as a separate letter after the base vowel , but more commonly words with umlauts are ordered immediately after the same word without umlauts .
as an example in a telephone book occurs after but before ( because ä is replaced by ae ) .
in a dictionary comes after , but in some dictionaries and all other words starting with " ä " may occur after all words starting with " a " .
in some older dictionaries or indexes , initial " sch " and " st " are treated as separate letters and are listed as separate entries after " s " , but they are usually treated as s+c+h and s+t .
written german also typically uses an alternative opening inverted comma ( quotation mark ) as in .
until the early *ord* century , german was mostly printed in blackletter typefaces ( mostly in fraktur , but also in schwabacher ) and written in corresponding handwriting ( for example kurrent and sütterlin ) .
these variants of the latin alphabet are very different from the serif or sans-serif antiqua typefaces used today , and the handwritten forms in particular are difficult for the untrained to read .
the printed forms , however , were claimed by some to be more readable when used for germanic languages .
( often , foreign names in a text were printed in an antiqua typeface even though the rest of the text was in fraktur .
) the nazis initially promoted fraktur and schwabacher because they were considered aryan , but they abolished them in *num* , claiming that these letters were jewish .
it is also believed that the nazi régime had banned this script as they realized that fraktur would inhibit communication in the territories occupied during world war ii .
the fraktur script however remains present in everyday life in pub signs , beer brands and other forms of advertisement , where it is used to convey a certain rusticality and antiquity .
a proper use of the long s , ( ) , ſ , is essential for writing german text in fraktur typefaces .
many antiqua typefaces include the long s also .
a specific set of rules applies for the use of long s in german text , but nowadays it is rarely used in antiqua typesetting .
any lower case " s " at the beginning of a syllable would be a long s , as opposed to a terminal s or short s ( the more common variation of the letter s ) , which marks the end of a syllable ; for example , in differentiating between the words ( guard-house ) and ( tube of polish / wax ) .
one can easily decide which " s " to use by appropriate hyphenation , ( vs .
) .
the long s only appears in lower case .
the orthography reform of *num* led to public controversy and considerable dispute .
the states ( ) of north rhine-westphalia and bavaria would not accept it .
the dispute landed at one point in the highest court , which made a short issue of it , claiming that the states had to decide for themselves and that only in schools could the reform be made the official rule – everybody else could continue writing as they had learned it .
after *num* years , without any intervention by the federal parliament , a major revision was installed in *num* , just in time for the coming school year .
in *num* , some traditional spellings were finally invalidated , whereas in *num* , on the other hand , many of the old comma rules were again put in force .
the most noticeable change was probably in the use of the letter " ß " , called ( " sharp s " ) or ( pronounced " ess-tsett " ) .
traditionally , this letter was used in three situations : thus , , and .
currently only the first rule is in effect , thus , , and .
the word ' foot ' has the letter " ß " because it contains a long vowel , even though that letter occurs at the end of a syllable .
the logic of this change is that an ' ß ' is a single letter whereas ' ss ' obviously are two letters , so the same distinction applies as for instance between the words and .
in german , vowels ( excluding diphthongs ; see below ) are either " short " or " long " , as follows : short is realized as in stressed syllables ( including secondary stress ) , but as in unstressed syllables .
note that stressed short can be spelled either with " e " or with " ä " ( for instance , " would have " and " chain " rhyme ) .
in general , the short vowels are open and the long vowels are close .
the one exception is the open sound of long " ä " ; in some varieties of standard german , and have merged into , removing this anomaly .
in that case , pairs like ' bears / berries ' or ' spike ( of wheat ) / honour ' become homophonous ( see : captain bluebear ) .
in many varieties of standard german , an unstressed is not pronounced , but vocalised to .
whether any particular vowel letter represents the long or short phoneme is not completely predictable , although the following regularities exist : both of these rules have exceptions ( e .
g .
" has " is short despite the first rule ; , " moon " is long despite the second rule ) .
for an " i " that is neither in the combination " ie " ( making it long ) nor followed by a double consonant or cluster ( making it short ) , there is no general rule .
in some cases , there are regional differences : in central germany ( hessen ) , the " o " in the proper name " hoffmann " is pronounced long , whereas most other germans would pronounce it short ; the same applies to the " e " in the geographical name " mecklenburg " for people in that region .
the word " cities " , is pronounced with a short vowel by some ( jan hofer , ard television ) and with a long vowel by others ( marietta slomka , zdf television ) .
finally , a vowel followed by " ch " can be short ( " compartment " , " kitchen " ) or long ( " search " , " books " ) almost at random .
thus , is homographous between " puddle " and " manner of laughing " ( colloquial ) or " laugh ! " ( imperative ) .
german vowels can form the following digraphs ( in writing ) and diphthongs ( in pronunciation ) ; note that the pronunciation of some of them ( ei , äu , eu ) is very different from what one would expect when considering the component letters : additionally , the digraph " ie " generally represents the phoneme , which is not a diphthong .
in many varieties , an at the end of a syllable is vocalised .
however , a sequence of a vowel followed by such a vocalised is not a phonemic diphthong : " bear " , " he " , " we " , " gate " , " short " , " words " .
in most varieties of standard german , syllables that begin with a vowel are preceded by a glottal stop .
with approximately *num* phonemes , the german consonant system exhibits an average number of consonants in comparison with other languages .
one of the more noteworthy ones is the unusual affricate .
the consonant inventory of the standard language is shown below .
german does not have any dental fricatives ( as english th ) .
the th sounds , which the english language still has , disappeared on the continent in german with the consonant shifts between the *ord* and the *ord* centuries .
it is sometimes possible to find parallels between english and german by replacing the english th with d in german : " thank " → in german , " this " and " that " → and , " thou " ( old *ord* person singular pronoun ) → , " think " → , " thirsty " → and many other examples .
likewise , the gh in germanic english words , pronounced in several different ways in modern english ( as an f , or not at all ) , can often be linked to german ch : " to laugh " → , " through " → , " high " → , " naught " → , " light " → or , " sight " → , " daughter " → , " neighbour " → .
the german language is used in german literature and can be traced back to the middle ages , with the most notable authors of the period being walther von der vogelweide and wolfram von eschenbach .
the , whose author remains unknown , is also an important work of the epoch .
the fairy tales collections collected and published by jacob and wilhelm grimm in the *ord* century became famous throughout the world .
reformer and theologian martin luther , who was the first to translate the bible into german , is widely credited for having set the basis for the modern " high german " language .
among the most well known poets and authors in german are lessing , goethe , schiller , kleist , hoffmann , brecht , heine , and kafka .
thirteen german-speaking people have won the nobel prize in literature : theodor mommsen , rudolf christoph eucken , paul von heyse , gerhart hauptmann , carl spitteler , thomas mann , nelly sachs , hermann hesse , heinrich böll , elias canetti , günter grass , elfriede jelinek and herta müller .
english has taken many loanwords from german , often without any change of spelling ( aside from , often , the elimination of umlauts and not capitalizing nouns ) : the use and learning of the german language are promoted by a number of organisations .
the government-backed ( named after the famous german author johann wolfgang von goethe ) aims to enhance the knowledge of german culture and language within europe and the rest of the world .
this is done by holding exhibitions and conferences with german-related themes , and providing training and guidance in the learning and use of the german language .
for example , the teaches the german language qualification .
the dortmund-based , which was founded in *num* , supports the german language and is the largest language association of citizens in the world .
the vds has more than thirty-five thousand members in over seventy countries .
its founder , statistics professor dr .
walter krämer , has remained chairperson of the association from its beginnings .
the german state broadcaster is the equivalent of the british bbc world service and provides radio and television broadcasts in german and *num* other languages across the globe .
its german language services are tailored for german language learners by being spoken at slow speed .
also provides an website to learn german .
galilean moons the galilean moons are the four largest moons of jupiter—io , europa , ganymede , and callisto .
they were first seen by galileo galilei in january *num* , and recognized by him as satellites of jupiter in march *num* .
they were the first objects found to orbit another planet .
their names derive from the lovers of zeus .
they are among the largest objects in the solar system with the exception of the sun and the eight planets , with a radius larger than any of the dwarf planets .
ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system , and is even bigger than the planet mercury , though only around half as massive .
the three inner moons—io , europa , and ganymede—are in a *num* : *num* : *num* orbital resonance with each other .
because of their much smaller size , and therefore weaker self-gravitation , all of jupiter's remaining moons have irregular forms rather than a spherical shape .
the galilean moons were observed in either *num* or *num* when galileo made improvements to his telescope , which enabled him to observe celestial bodies more distinctly than ever .
galileo's observations showed the importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by proving that there were objects in space that cannot be seen by the naked eye .
the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than earth dealt a serious blow to the then-accepted ptolemaic world system , a geocentric theory in which everything orbits around earth .
galileo initially named his discovery the cosmica sidera ( " cosimo's stars " ) , but the names that eventually prevailed were chosen by simon marius .
marius discovered the moons independently at nearly the same time as galileo , and gave them their present names , which were suggested by johannes kepler , in his " mundus jovialis " , published in *num* .
as a result of improvements galileo galilei made to the telescope , with a magnifying capability of 20× , he was able to see celestial bodies more distinctly than was ever possible before .
this allowed galilei to observe in either december *num* or january *num* what came to be known as the galilean moons .
on january *num* , *num* , galileo wrote a letter containing the first mention of jupiter's moons .
at the time , he saw only three of them , and he believed them to be fixed stars near jupiter .
he continued to observe these celestial orbs from january *num* to march *num* , *num* .
in these observations , he discovered a fourth body , and also observed that the four were not fixed stars , but rather were orbiting jupiter .
galileo's discovery proved the importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by showing that there were objects in space to be discovered that until then had remained unseen by the naked eye .
more importantly , the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than earth dealt a blow to the then-accepted ptolemaic world system , which held that earth was at the center of the universe and all other celestial bodies revolved around it .
galileo's " sidereus nuncius " ( " starry messenger " ) , which announced celestial observations through his telescope , does not explicitly mention copernican heliocentrism , a theory that placed the sun at the center of the universe .
nevertheless , galileo accepted the copernican theory .
a chinese historian of astronomy , xi zezong , has claimed that a " small reddish star " observed near jupiter in *num* bce by chinese astronomer gan de may have been ganymede , predating galileo's discovery by around two millennia .
in *num* , galileo had been employed as a mathematics tutor for cosimo de ' medici .
in *num* , cosimo became grand duke cosimo ii of tuscany .
galileo , seeking patronage from his now-wealthy former student and his powerful family , used the discovery of jupiter's moons to gain it .
on february *num* , *num* , galileo wrote to the grand duke's secretary : "god graced me with being able , through such a singular sign , to reveal to my lord my devotion and the desire i have that his glorious name live as equal among the stars , and since it is up to me , the first discoverer , to name these new planets , i wish , in imitation of the great sages who placed the most excellent heroes of that age among the stars , to inscribe these with the name of the most serene grand duke .
" galileo asked whether he should name the moons the " cosmian stars " , after cosimo alone , or the " medician stars " , which would honor all four brothers in the medici clan .
the secretary replied that the latter name would be best .
on march *num* , *num* , galileo wrote his dedicatory letter to the duke of tuscany , and the next day sent a copy to the grand duke , hoping to obtain the grand duke's support as quickly as possible .
on march *num* , he sent the telescope he had used to first view jupiter's moons to the grand duke , along with an official copy of " sidereus nuncius " ( " the starry messenger " ) that , following the secretary's advice , named the four moons the medician stars .
in his dedicatory introduction , galileo wrote : scarcely have the immortal graces of your soul begun to shine forth on earth than bright stars offer themselves in the heavens which , like tongues , will speak of and celebrate your most excellent virtues for all time .
behold , therefore , four stars reserved for your illustrious name .
.
.
which .
.
.
make their journeys and orbits with a marvelous speed around the star of jupiter .
.
.
like children of the same family .
.
.
indeed , it appears the maker of the stars himself , by clear arguments , admonished me to call these new planets by the illustrious name of your highness before all others .
galileo initially called his discovery the cosmica sidera ( " cosimo's stars " ) , in honour of cosimo ii de ' medici ( 1590–1621 ) .
at cosimo's suggestion , galileo changed the name to medicea sidera ( " the medician stars " ) , honouring all four medici brothers ( cosimo , francesco , carlo , and lorenzo ) .
the discovery was announced in the " sidereus nuncius " ( " starry messenger " ) , published in venice in march *num* , less than two months after the first observations .
other names put forward include : the names that eventually prevailed were chosen by simon marius , who discovered the moons independently at the same time as galileo : he named them at the suggestion of johannes kepler after lovers of the god zeus ( the greek equivalent of jupiter ) : " io " , " europa " , " ganymede " and " callisto " , in his " mundus jovialis " , published in *num* .
galileo steadfastly refused to use marius ' names and invented as a result the numbering scheme that is still used nowadays , in parallel with proper moon names .
the numbers run from jupiter outward , thus i , ii , iii and iv for io , europa , ganymede , and callisto respectively .
galileo used this system in his notebooks but never actually published it .
the numbered names ( jupiter " x " ) were used until the *ord* century when other inner moons were discovered , and marius ' names became widely used .
galileo was able to develop a method of determining longitude based on the timing of the orbits of the galilean moons .
the times of the eclipses of the moons could be precisely calculated in advance , and compared with local observations on land or on ship to determine the local time and hence longitude .
the main problem with the technique was that it was difficult to observe the galilean moons through a telescope on a moving ship ; a problem that galileo tried to solve with the invention of the celatone .
the method was used by cassini and picard to re-map france .
some models predict that there may have been several generations of galilean satellites in jupiter's early history .
each generation of moons to have formed would have spiraled into jupiter and been destroyed , due to tidal interactions with jupiter's proto-satellite disk , with new moons forming from the remaining debris .
by the time the present generation formed , the gas in the proto-satellite disk had thinned out to the point that it no longer greatly interfered with the moons ' orbits .
other models suggest that galilean satellites formed in a proto-satellite disk , in which formation timescales were comparable to or shorter than orbital migration timescales .
io is anhydrous and likely has an interior of rock and metal .
europa is thought to contain *num* % ice and water by mass with the remainder rock .
these moons are , in increasing order of distance from jupiter : io ( jupiter i ) is the innermost of the four galilean moons of jupiter and , with a diameter of *num* kilometers , the fourth-largest moon in the solar system .
it was named after io , a priestess of hera who became one of the lovers of zeus .
nevertheless , it was simply referred to as " jupiter i " , or " the first satellite of jupiter " , until the *ord* century .
with over *num* active volcanos , io is the most geologically active object in the solar system .
its surface is dotted with more than *num* mountains , some of which are taller than earth's mount everest .
unlike most satellites in the outer solar system ( which have a thick coating of ice ) , io is primarily composed of silicate rock surrounding a molten iron or iron sulfide core .
although not proven , recent data from the galileo orbiter indicate that io might have its own magnetic field .
io has an extremely thin atmosphere made up mostly of sulfur dioxide ( so ) .
if a surface data or collection vessel were to land on io in the future , it would have to be extremely tough ( similar to the tank-like bodies of the soviet venera landers ) to survive the radiation and magnetic fields that originate from jupiter .
europa ( jupiter ii ) , the second of the four galilean moons , is the second closest to jupiter and the smallest at *num* .
*num* kilometers in diameter , which is slightly smaller than the moon .
the name comes from a mythical phoenician noblewoman , europa , who was courted by zeus and became the queen of crete , though the name did not become widely used until the *ord* century .
it has a smooth and bright surface , with a layer of water surrounding the mantle of the planet , thought to be *num* kilometers thick .
the smooth surface includes a layer of ice , while the bottom of the ice is theorized to be liquid water .
the apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it , which could conceivably serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life .
heat energy from tidal flexing ensures that the ocean remains liquid and drives geological activity .
life may exist in europa's under-ice ocean .
so far , there is no evidence that life exists on europa , but the likely presence of liquid water has spurred calls to send a probe there .
the prominent markings that criss-cross the moon seem to be mainly albedo features , which emphasize low topography .
there are few craters on europa because its surface is tectonically active and young .
some theories suggest that jupiter's gravity is causing these markings , as one side of europa is constantly facing jupiter .
also , volcanic water eruptions splitting the surface of europa , and even geysers have been considered as a cause .
the color of the markings , reddish-brown , is theorized to be caused by sulfur , but scientists cannot confirm that , because no data collection devices have been sent to europa .
europa is primarily made of silicate rock and likely has an iron core .
it has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen .
ganymede ( jupiter iii ) , the third galilean moon is named after the mythological ganymede , cupbearer of the greek gods and zeus's beloved .
ganymede is the largest natural satellite in the solar system at *num* .
*num* kilometers in diameter , which makes it larger than the planet mercury – although only at about half of its mass since ganymede is an icy world .
it is the only satellite in the solar system known to possess a magnetosphere , likely created through convection within the liquid iron core .
ganymede is composed primarily of silicate rock and water ice , and a salt-water ocean is believed to exist nearly *num* km below ganymede's surface , sandwiched between layers of ice .
the metallic core of ganymede suggests a greater heat at some time in its past than had previously been proposed .
the surface is a mix of two types of terrain—highly cratered dark regions and younger , but still ancient , regions with a large array of grooves and ridges .
ganymede has a high number of craters , but many are gone or barely visible due to its icy crust forming over them .
the satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes o , o , and possibly o ( ozone ) , and some atomic hydrogen .
callisto ( jupiter iv ) is the fourth and last galilean moon , and is the second largest of the four , and at *num* .
*num* kilometers in diameter , it is the third largest moon in the solar system , and barely smaller than mercury , though only a third of the latter's mass .
it is named after the greek mythological nymph callisto , a lover of zeus who was a daughter of the arkadian king lykaon and a hunting companion of the goddess artemis .
the moon does not form part of the orbital resonance that affects three inner galilean satellites and thus does not experience appreciable tidal heating .
callisto is composed of approximately equal amounts of rock and ices , which makes it the least dense of the galilean moons .
it is one of the most heavily cratered satellites in the solar system , and one major feature is a basin around *num* km wide called valhalla .
callisto is surrounded by an extremely thin atmosphere composed of carbon dioxide and probably molecular oxygen .
investigation revealed that callisto may possibly have a subsurface ocean of liquid water at depths less than *num* kilometres .
the likely presence of an ocean within callisto indicates that it can or could harbour life .
however , this is less likely than on nearby europa .
callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future exploration of the jupiter system since it is furthest from the intense radiation of jupiter .
fluctuations in the orbits of the moons indicate that their mean density decreases with distance from jupiter .
callisto , the outermost and least dense of the four , has a density intermediate between ice and rock whereas io , the innermost and densest moon , has a density intermediate between rock and iron .
callisto has an ancient , heavily cratered and unaltered ice surface and the way it rotates indicates that its density is equally distributed , suggesting that it has no rocky or metallic core but consists of a homogeneous mix of rock and ice .
this may well have been the original structure of all the moons .
the rotation of the three inner moons , in contrast , indicates differentiation of their interiors with denser matter at the core and lighter matter above .
they also reveal significant alteration of the surface .
ganymede reveals past tectonic movement of the ice surface which required partial melting of subsurface layers .
europa reveals more dynamic and recent movement of this nature , suggesting a thinner ice crust .
finally , io , the innermost moon , has a sulfur surface , active volcanism and no sign of ice .
all this evidence suggests that the nearer a moon is to jupiter the hotter its interior .
the current model is that the moons experience tidal heating as a result of the gravitational field of jupiter in inverse proportion to the square of their distance from the giant planet .
in all but callisto this will have melted the interior ice , allowing rock and iron to sink to the interior and water to cover the surface .
in ganymede a thick and solid ice crust then formed .
in warmer europa a thinner more easily broken crust formed .
in io the heating is so extreme that all the rock has melted and water has long ago boiled out into space .
jupiter's regular satellites are believed to have formed from a circumplanetary disk , a ring of accreting gas and solid debris analogous to a protoplanetary disk .
they may be the remnants of a score of galilean-mass satellites that formed early in jupiter's history .
simulations suggest that , while the disk had a relatively high mass at any given moment , over time a substantial fraction ( several tenths of a percent ) of the mass of jupiter captured from the solar nebula was processed through it .
however , the disk mass of only *num* % that of jupiter is required to explain the existing satellites .
thus there may have been several generations of galilean-mass satellites in jupiter's early history .
each generation of moons would have spiraled into jupiter , due to drag from the disk , with new moons then forming from the new debris captured from the solar nebula .
by the time the present ( possibly fifth ) generation formed , the disk had thinned out to the point that it no longer greatly interfered with the moons ' orbits .
the current galilean moons were still affected , falling into and being partially protected by an orbital resonance which still exists for io , europa , and ganymede .
ganymede's larger mass means that it would have migrated inward at a faster rate than europa or io .
all four galilean moons are bright enough to be viewed from earth without a telescope , if only they could appear farther away from jupiter .
( they are , however , easily distinguished with even low-powered binoculars .
) they have apparent magnitudes between *num* .
*num* and *num* .
*num* when jupiter is in opposition with the sun , and are about one unit of magnitude dimmer when jupiter is in conjunction .
the main difficulty in observing the moons from earth is their proximity to jupiter , since they are obscured by its brightness .
the maximum angular separations of the moons are between *num* and *num* arcminutes from jupiter , which is close to the limit of human visual acuity .
ganymede and callisto , at their maximum separation , are the likeliest targets for potential naked-eye observation .
albert schweitzer albert schweitzer , om ( *num* january *num* september *num* ) was an alsatian theologian , organist , writer , humanitarian , philosopher , and physician .
a lutheran , schweitzer challenged both the secular view of jesus as depicted by the historical-critical method current at this time , as well as the traditional christian view .
his contributions to the interpretation of pauline christianity concern the role of paul's mysticism of " being in christ " as primary and the doctrine of justification by faith as secondary .
he received the *num* nobel peace prize for his philosophy of " reverence for life " , becoming the eighth frenchman to be awarded that prize .
his philosophy was expressed in many ways , but most famously in founding and sustaining the albert schweitzer hospital in lambaréné , in the part of french equatorial africa which is now gabon .
as a music scholar and organist , he studied the music of german composer johann sebastian bach and influenced the organ reform movement ( " orgelbewegung " ) .
schweitzer was born in the province of alsace , which was a part of the holy roman empire up to the thirty year war .
in *num* , with the treaty of westphalia , the habsburgs renounced their claims to its territory , when it became a part of france for the first time .
in *num* , through the treaty of frankfurt , alsace became a part of the german empire ( " reichsland " ) , becoming french a second time in *num* , after germany's defeat during the first world war .
schweitzer considered himself french , but wrote mostly in german .
his mother-tongue was alsatian , a low alemannic german dialect , although he was also fluent in french and high-german .
schweitzer was born in kaysersberg , haute alsace , the son of louis schweitzer and adèle schillinger .
he spent his childhood in the alsatian village of gunsbach , where his father , the local lutheran-evangelical pastor of the epcaal , taught him how to play music .
the tiny village became home to the association internationale albert schweitzer ( aias ) .
the medieval parish church of gunsbach was shared by the protestant and catholic congregations , which held their prayers in different areas at different times on sundays .
this compromise arose after the protestant reformation and the thirty years ' war .
schweitzer , the pastor's son , grew up in this exceptional environment of religious tolerance , and developed the belief that true christianity should always work towards a unity of faith and purpose .
schweitzer's first language was the alsatian dialect of german language .
at the mulhouse gymnasium he received his " abitur " ( the certificate at the end of secondary education ) in *num* .
he studied organ in mulhouse from *num* to *num* with eugène munch , organist at the protestant cathedral , who inspired schweitzer with his profound enthusiasm for the music of german composer richard wagner .
in *num* he played for the french organist charles-marie widor ( at saint-sulpice , paris ) , for whom johann sebastian bach's organ music contained a mystic sense of the eternal .
widor , deeply impressed , agreed to teach schweitzer without fee , and a great and influential friendship thus began .
from *num* schweitzer studied protestant theology at the kaiser wilhelm university in strasbourg .
there he also received instruction in piano and counterpoint from professor gustav jacobsthal , and associated closely with ernest munch , the brother of his former teacher , organist of st william church , who was also a passionate admirer of j .
s .
bach's music .
schweitzer served his one-year compulsory military service in *num* .
schweitzer saw many operas of richard wagner in strasbourg ( under otto lohse ) and in *num* he managed to afford a visit to the bayreuth festival to see wagner's " der ring des nibelungen " and " parsifal " , which deeply impressed him .
in *num* he went back to paris to write a phd dissertation on " the religious philosophy of kant " at the sorbonne , and to study in earnest with widor .
here he often met with the elderly aristide cavaillé-coll .
he also studied piano at that time with marie jaëll .
in *num* , schweitzer spent the summer semester at the university of berlin and eventually obtained his theology degree in university of strasbourg .
he published his phd thesis at the university of tübingen in *num* .
in *num* , schweitzer began his study of medicine at the university of strasbourg , culminating in the degree of m .
d .
in *num* .
schweitzer rapidly gained prominence as a musical scholar and organist , dedicated also to the rescue , restoration and study of historic pipe organs .
with theological insight , he interpreted the use of pictorial and symbolical representation in j .
s .
bach's religious music .
in *num* he astonished widor by explaining figures and motifs in bach's chorale preludes as painter-like tonal and rhythmic imagery illustrating themes from the words of the hymns on which they were based .
they were works of devotional contemplation in which the musical design corresponded to literary ideas , conceived visually .
widor had not grown up with knowledge of the old lutheran hymns .
the exposition of these ideas , encouraged by widor and munch , became schweitzer's last task , and appeared in the masterly study " j .
s .
bach : le musicien-poète " , written in french and published in *num* .
there was great demand for a german edition , but , instead of translating it , he decided to rewrite it .
the result was two volumes ( " j .
s .
bach " ) , which were published in *num* and translated into english by ernest newman in *num* .
ernst cassirer , a contemporaneous german philosopher , called it " one of the best interpretations " of bach .
during its preparation schweitzer became a friend of cosima wagner , then resident in strasbourg , with whom he had many theological and musical conversations , exploring his view of bach's descriptive music , and playing the major chorale preludes for her at the temple neuf .
schweitzer's interpretative approach greatly influenced the modern understanding of bach's music .
he became a welcome guest at the wagners ' home , wahnfried .
he also corresponded with composer clara faisst , who became a good friend .
his pamphlet " the art of organ building and organ playing in germany and france " ( *num* , republished with an appendix on the state of the organ-building industry in *num* ) effectively launched the 20th-century " orgelbewegung " , which turned away from romantic extremes and rediscovered baroque principles—although this sweeping reform movement in organ building eventually went further than schweitzer had intended .
in *num* he addressed the " third congress of the international society of music " at vienna on the subject .
having circulated a questionnaire among players and organ-builders in several european countries , he produced a very considered report .
this provided the basis for the " international regulations for organ building " .
he envisaged instruments in which the french late-romantic full-organ sound should work integrally with the english and german romantic reed pipes , and with the classical alsace silbermann organ resources and baroque flue pipes , all in registers regulated ( by stops ) to access distinct voices in fugue or counterpoint capable of combination without loss of distinctness : different voices singing the same music together .
schweitzer also studied piano under isidor philipp , head of the piano department at the paris conservatory .
in *num* widor and schweitzer were among the six musicians who founded the paris bach society , a choir dedicated to performing j .
s .
bach's music , for whose concerts schweitzer took the organ part regularly until *num* .
he was also appointed organist for the bach concerts of the orféo català at barcelona , spain , and often travelled there for that purpose .
he and widor collaborated on a new edition of bach's organ works , with detailed analysis of each work in three languages ( english , french , german ) .
schweitzer , who insisted that the score should show bach's notation with no additional markings , wrote the commentaries for the preludes and fugues , and widor those for the sonatas and concertos : six volumes were published in 1912–14 .
three more , to contain the chorale preludes with schweitzer's analyses , were to be worked on in africa , but these were never completed , perhaps because for him they were inseparable from his evolving theological thought .
on departure for lambaréné in *num* he was presented with a pedal piano , a piano with pedal attachments to operate like an organ pedal-keyboard .
built especially for the tropics , it was delivered by river in a huge dug-out canoe to lambaréné , packed in a zinc-lined case .
at first he regarded his new life as a renunciation of his art , and fell out of practice : but after some time he resolved to study and learn by heart the works of bach , mendelssohn , widor , césar franck , and max reger systematically .
it became his custom to play during the lunch hour and on sunday afternoons .
schweitzer's pedal piano was still in use at lambaréné in *num* .
according to a visitor , dr .
gaine cannon , of balsam grove , n .
c .
, the old , dilapidated piano-organ was still being played by dr .
schweitzer in *num* , and stories told that " his fingers were still lively " on the old instrument at *num* years of age .
sir donald tovey dedicated his conjectural completion of bach's " the art of fugue " to schweitzer .
schweitzer's recordings of organ-music , and his innovative recording technique , are described below .
one of his notable pupils was conductor and composer hans münch .
in *num* schweitzer became a deacon at the church of saint nicholas in strasbourg .
in *num* , with the completion of his licentiate in theology , he was ordained as curate , and that year he witnessed the oberammergau passion play .
in the following year he became provisional principal of the theological college of saint thomas , from which he had just graduated , and in *num* his appointment was made permanent .
in *num* he published " geschichte der leben-jesu-forschung " ( " history of life-of-jesus research " ) .
this book , which established his reputation , was first published in english in *num* as " the quest of the historical jesus " .
under this title the book became famous in the english-speaking world .
a second german edition was published in *num* , containing theologically significant revisions and expansions : but this revised edition did not appear in english until *num* .
in *num* he published " mystik des apostels paulus " ( " the mysticism of paul the apostle " ) ; a second edition was published in *num* .
in the quest , schweitzer reviewed all former work on the " historical jesus " back to the late *ord* century .
he showed that the image of jesus had changed with the times and outlooks of the various authors and gave his own synopsis and interpretation of the previous century's findings .
he maintained that the life of jesus must be interpreted in the light of jesus ' own convictions , which reflected late jewish eschatology and apocalypticism .
schweitzer writes : the jesus of nazareth who came forward publicly as the messiah , who preached the ethic of the kingdom of god , who founded the kingdom of heaven upon earth and died to give his work its final consecration never existed .
he is a figure designed by rationalism , endowed with life by liberalism , and clothed by modern theology in a historical garb .
this image has not been destroyed from outside ; it has fallen to pieces .

[ *num* ] he observes the many verses describing important events that never took place and technically , now , never can take place .
the concept that christianity started as a jewish apocalyptic movement is evidenced by the teachings of the historical jesus concerning the end of days .
not only did he preach he would rise from the grave , but that he would also ascend to heaven and one day return to judge and rule over the world , saying that no one , including himself , knew the exact time of his return , but it would be before the end of the end of the first generation of followers .
in the quest of the historical jesus , schweitzer verifies and cross-referenced the many new testament verses declaring imminent fulfillment of the promise of the world's ending within the lifetime of jesus's original followers .
[ *num* ] he noted that in the gospel of mark , jesus speaks of a " tribulation " , with his " coming in the clouds with great power and glory " ( st .
mark ) , and states when it will happen : " this generation shall not pass , till all these things be fulfilled " ( st .
matthew , *num* : *num* ) or , " have taken place " ( luke *num* : *num* ) .
similarly , in *ord* peter *num* : *num* , " christ , who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you , " as well as " but the end of all things is at hand , " ( *num* peter *num* : *num* ) and " surely , i come quickly .
" ( revelation *num* : *num* ) .
schweitzer observes that jesus very specifically states " not seal up the words of the prophecy " and promises that some of his listeners , as well as the high priest at his trial , would be alive to see him return to the earth .
he says , " blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy and heed the things which are written in it ; for the time is near " ( revelation *num* : *num* ) .
st .
paul spoke of the last times , " brethren , the time is short , it remaineth , that both they that have wives be as though they had none , " ( *num* corinthians *num* : *num* ) and " god hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son , " ( hebrews *num* : *num* ) .
also , " there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom " ( matthew *num* : *num* ) as well as " until they see that the kingdom of god has come with power , " ( mark *num* : *num* ) and " till they see the kingdom of god " ( luke *num* : *num* ) reinforce this prophecy .
schweitzer observes that st .
paul , urgently , believed in the immediacy of the second coming of jesus .
schweitzer insists that it is unreasonable for modern followers of jesus to believe that " coming quickly " , " near " , and " soon " could mean hundreds , much less thousands , of years of the faithful waiting for a second coming .
his evidence is verses " blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy and heed the things which are written in it ; for the time is near .
" ( revelation *num* : *num* ) " and he said to me , ' these words are faithful and true ' ; and the lord , the god of the spirits of the prophets , sent his angel to show to his bond-servants the things which must soon take place .
" as well as " and behold , i am coming quickly .
blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book .
" he references " and he said to me , " do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book , for the time is near " ( revelation *num* : *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* ) .
" all these things shall come upon this generation " ( matthew *num* : *num* ) as well .
schweitzer's observations are in stark contrast to many modern variants of christian belief , those ignoring these verses .
schweitzer concludes that 1st-century christian theology ; first belief , originating in the lifetimes of the very first followers of jesus , is totally incompatible with modern theology .
in " the mysticism of paul the apostle " , schweitzer first distinguishes between two categories of mysticism : primitive and developed .
primitive mysticism " has not yet risen to a conception of the universal , and is still confined to naive views of earthly and super-earthly , temporal and eternal .
" additionally , he argues that this view of a " union with the divinity , brought about by efficacious ceremonies , is found even in quite primitive religions .
" on the other hand , a more developed form of mysticism can be found in the greek mystery-cults that were popular in first-century a .
d .
society .
these included the cults of attis , osiris , and mithras .
a developed form of mysticism is attained when the " conception of the universal is reached and a man reflects upon his relation to the totality of being and to being in itself .
" schweitzer claims that this form of mysticism is more intellectual and can be found " among the brahmans and in the buddha , in platonism , in stoicism , in spinoza , schopenhauer , and hegel .
" next , schweitzer poses the question : " of what precise kind then is the mysticism of paul ? " he locates paul between the two extremes of primitive mysticism and developed mysticism .
paul stands high above primitive mysticism , due to his intellectual writings , but never speaks of being one with god or being in god .
instead , he conceives of sonship to god as " mediated and effected by means of the mystical union with christ .
" he summarizes pauline mysticism as " being in christ " rather than " being in god .
" paul's imminent eschatology ( from his background in jewish eschatology ) causes him to believe that the kingdom of god has not yet come and that christians are now living in the time of christ .
christ-mysticism holds the field until god-mysticism becomes possible , which is in the near future .
therefore , schweitzer argues that paul is the only theologian who does not claim that christians can have an experience of " being-in-god .
" rather , paul uses the phrase " being-in-christ " to illustrate how jesus is a mediator between the christian community and god .
additionally , schweitzer explains how the experience of " being-in-christ " is not a " static partaking in the spiritual being of christ , but as the real co-experiencing of his dying and rising again .
" the " realistic " partaking in the mystery of jesus is only possible within the solidarity of the christian community .
one of schweitzer's major arguments in " the mysticism of paul the apostle " is that paul's mysticism , marked by his phrase " being in christ " , gives the clue to the whole of pauline theology .
rather than reading justification by faith as the main topic of pauline thought , which has been the most popular argument set forward by martin luther , schweitzer argues that paul's emphasis was on the mystical union with god by " being in christ .
" jaroslav pelikan , in his forward to " the mysticism of paul the apostle , " points out that : schweitzer contrasts paul's " realistic " dying and rising with christ to the " symbolism " of hellenism .
although paul is widely influenced by hellenistic thought , he is not controlled by it .
schweitzer explains that paul focused on the idea of fellowship with the divine being through the " realistic " dying and rising with christ rather than the " symbolic " hellenistic act of becoming like christ through deification .
after baptism , the christian is continually renewed throughout their lifetime due to participation in the dying and rising with christ ( most notably through the sacraments ) .
on the other hand , the hellenist " lives on the store of experience which he acquired in the initiation " and is not continually affected by a shared communal experience .
another major difference between paul's " realism " and hellenistic " symbolism " is the exclusive nature of the former and the inclusive nature of the latter .
schweitzer unabashedly emphasizes the fact that " paul's thought follows predestinarian lines .
" he explains , " only the man who is elected thereto can enter into relation with god .
" although every human being is invited to become a christian , only those who have undergone the initiation into the christian community through baptism can share in the " realistic " dying and rising with christ .
at the age of *num* , in *num* , schweitzer answered the call of the society of the evangelist missions of paris , which was looking for a medical doctor .
however , the committee of this missionary society was not ready to accept his offer , considering his lutheran theology to be " incorrect " .
he could easily have obtained a place in a german evangelical mission , but wished to follow the original call despite the doctrinal difficulties .
amid a hail of protests from his friends , family and colleagues , he resigned his post and re-entered the university as a student in a three-year course towards the degree of doctorate in medicine , a subject in which he had little knowledge or previous aptitude .
he planned to spread the gospel by the example of his christian labour of healing , rather than through the verbal process of preaching , and believed that this service should be acceptable within any branch of christian teaching .
even in his study of medicine , and through his clinical course , schweitzer pursued the ideal of the philosopher-scientist .
by extreme application and hard work , he completed his studies successfully at the end of *num* .
his medical degree dissertation was another work on the historical jesus , " the psychiatric study of jesus " .
he defended jesus′ mental health in it .
in june *num* , he married helene bresslau , municipal inspector for orphans and daughter of the jewish pan-germanist historian harry bresslau .
in *num* , now armed with a medical degree , schweitzer made a definite proposal to go as a medical doctor to work at his own expense in the paris missionary society's mission at lambaréné on the ogooué river , in what is now gabon , in africa ( then a french colony ) .
he refused to attend a committee to inquire into his doctrine , but met each committee member personally and was at last accepted .
through concerts and other fund-raising , he was ready to equip a small hospital .
in spring *num* , he and his wife set off to establish a hospital ( albert schweitzer hospital ) near an existing mission post .
the site was nearly *num* miles ( *num* days by raft ) upstream from the mouth of the ogooué at port gentil ( cape lopez ) ( and so accessible to external communications ) , but downstream of most tributaries , so that internal communications within gabon converged towards lambaréné .
in the first nine months , he and his wife had about *num* , *num* patients to examine , some travelling many days and hundreds of kilometers to reach him .
in addition to injuries , he was often treating severe sandflea and crawcraw sores , " framboesia " ( yaws ) , tropical eating sores , heart disease , tropical dysentery , tropical malaria , sleeping sickness , leprosy , fevers , strangulated hernias , necrosis , abdominal tumours and chronic constipation and nicotine poisoning , while also attempting to deal with deliberate poisonings , fetishism and fear of cannibalism among the mbahouin .
schweitzer's wife , helene schweitzer , was an anaesthetist for surgical operations .
after briefly occupying a shed formerly used as a chicken hut , in autumn *num* they built their first hospital of corrugated iron , with two 13-foot rooms ( consulting room and operating theatre ) and with a dispensary and sterilising room in spaces below the broad eaves .
the waiting room and dormitory ( *num* by *num* feet ) were built , like native huts , of unhewn logs along a *ord* path leading from the hospital to the landing-place .
the schweitzers had their own bungalow and employed as their assistant joseph , a french-speaking galoa ( mpongwe ) who first came as a patient .
after world war i broke out in july *num* , schweitzer and his wife , german citizens in a french colony when the countries were at war , were put under supervision by the french military at lambaréné , where schweitzer continued his work .
in *num* , exhausted by over four years ' work and by tropical anaemia , they were taken to bordeaux and interned first in garaison and then from march *num* in saint-rémy-de-provence .
in july *num* , after being transferred to his home in alsace , he was a free man again .
at this time schweitzer , born a german citizen , had his parents ' former ( pre-1871 ) french citizenship reinstated and became a french citizen .
then , working as medical assistant and assistant-pastor in strasbourg , he advanced his project on the philosophy of civilization , which had occupied his mind since *num* .
by *num* , his health recovering , he was giving organ recitals and doing other fund-raising work to repay borrowings and raise funds for returning to gabon .
in *num* , he delivered the dale memorial lectures in oxford university , and from these in the following year appeared volumes i and ii of his great work , " the decay and restoration of civilization " and " civilization and ethics " .
the two remaining volumes , on " the world-view of reverence for life " and a fourth on the civilized state , were never completed .
in *num* he returned without his wife , but with an oxford undergraduate , noel gillespie , as assistant .
everything was heavily decayed , and building and doctoring progressed together for months .
he now had salvarsan for treating syphilitic ulcers and framboesia .
additional medical staff , nurse ( miss ) kottmann and dr .
victor nessmann , joined him in *num* , and dr .
mark lauterberg in *num* ; the growing hospital was manned by native orderlies .
later dr .
trensz replaced nessmann , and martha lauterberg and hans muggenstorm joined them .
joseph also returned .
in 1925-6 , new hospital buildings were constructed , and also a ward for white patients , so that the site became like a village .
the onset of famine and a dysentery epidemic created fresh problems .
much of the building work was carried out with the help of local people and patients .
drug advances for sleeping sickness included germanin and tryparsamide .
trensz conducted experiments showing that the non-amoebic strain of dysentery was caused by a paracholera vibrion ( facultative anaerobic bacteria ) .
with the new hospital built and the medical team established , schweitzer returned to europe in *num* , this time leaving a functioning hospital at work .
he was there again from *num* to *num* .
gradually his opinions and concepts became acknowledged , not only in europe , but worldwide .
there was a further period of work in *num* .
in january *num* , he returned again to lambaréné and continued working there throughout world war ii .
schweitzer considered his work as a medical missionary in africa to be his response to jesus ' call to become " fishers of men " but also as a small recompense for the historic guilt of european colonizers : schweitzer was one of colonialism's harshest critics .
in a sermon that he preached on *num* january *num* , before he had told anyone of his plans to dedicate the rest of his life to work as a doctor in africa , he said : schweitzer was nonetheless still sometimes accused of being paternalistic , colonialist , and racist in his attitude towards africans , and in some ways his views did differ from that of many liberals and other critics of colonialism .
for instance , he thought that gabonese independence came too early , without adequate education or accommodation to local circumstances .
edgar berman quotes schweitzer as having said in *num* , " no society can go from the primeval directly to an industrial state without losing the leavening that time and an agricultural period allow .
" schweitzer believed dignity and respect must be extended to blacks , while also sometimes characterizing them as children .
he summarized his views on european-african relations by saying " with regard to the negroes , then , i have coined the formula : ' i am your brother , it is true , but your elder brother .
' " chinua achebe has criticized him for this characterization , though achebe acknowledges that schweitzer's use of the word " brother " at all was , for a european of the early *ord* century , an unusual expression of human solidarity between europeans and africans .
schweitzer eventually emended and complicated this notion with his later statement that " the time for speaking of older and younger brothers has passed " .
later in life he became more convinced that " modern civilization " was actually inferior to or the same as previous cultures in terms of morality .
american journalist john gunther visited lambaréné in the 1950s and reported schweitzer's patronizing attitude towards africans .
he also noted the lack of africans trained to be skilled workers .
by comparison , his contemporary sir albert cook in uganda had been training nurses and midwives since the 1910s and had published a manual of midwifery in the local language of luganda .
after three decades in africa , schweitzer still depended on europe for nurses .
the journalist james cameron visited lambaréné in *num* ( when schweitzer was *num* ) and found significant flaws in the practices and attitudes of schweitzer and his staff .
the hospital suffered from squalor and was without modern amenities , and schweitzer had little contact with the local people .
cameron did not make public what he had seen at the time : according to a bbc dramatisation , he made the unusual journalistic decision to withhold the story , and resisted the expressed wish of his employers to publish an exposé .
the poor conditions of the hospital in lambaréné were also famously criticized by nigerian professor and novelist chinua achebe in his essay on joseph conrad's novel " heart of darkness " : " in a comment which has often been quoted schweitzer says : ' the african is indeed my brother but my junior brother .
' and so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate to the needs of junior brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice in the days before the germ theory of disease came into being .
" the keynote of schweitzer's personal philosophy ( which he considered to be his greatest contribution to mankind ) was the idea of " reverence for life " ( " "ehrfurcht vor dem leben" " ) .
he thought that western civilization was decaying because it had abandoned affirmation of life as its ethical foundation .
in the preface to " civilization and ethics " ( *num* ) he argued that western philosophy from descartes to kant had set out to explain the objective world expecting that humanity would be found to have a special meaning within it .
but no such meaning was found , and the rational , life-affirming optimism of the age of enlightenment began to evaporate .
a rift opened between this world-view , as material knowledge , and the life-view , understood as will , expressed in the pessimist philosophies from schopenhauer onward .
scientific materialism ( advanced by herbert spencer and charles darwin ) portrayed an objective world process devoid of ethics , entirely an expression of the will-to-live .
schweitzer wrote , " true philosophy must start from the most immediate and comprehensive fact of consciousness , and this may be formulated as follows : ' i am life which wills to live , and i exist in the midst of life which wills to live .
' " in nature one form of life must always prey upon another .
however , human consciousness holds an awareness of , and sympathy for , the will of other beings to live .
an ethical human strives to escape from this contradiction so far as possible .
though we cannot perfect the endeavour we should strive for it : the will-to-live constantly renews itself , for it is both an evolutionary necessity and a spiritual phenomenon .
life and love are rooted in this same principle , in a personal spiritual relationship to the universe .
ethics themselves proceed from the need to respect the wish of other beings to exist as one does towards oneself .
even so , schweitzer found many instances in world religions and philosophies in which the principle was denied , not least in the european middle ages , and in the indian brahminic philosophy .
for schweitzer , mankind had to accept that objective reality is ethically neutral .
it could then affirm a new enlightenment through spiritual rationalism , by giving priority to volition or ethical will as the primary meaning of life .
mankind had to choose to create the moral structures of civilization : the world-view must derive from the life-view , not vice versa .
respect for life , overcoming coarser impulses and hollow doctrines , leads the individual to live in the service of other people and of every living creature .
in contemplation of the will-to-life , respect for the life of others becomes the highest principle and the defining purpose of humanity .
such was the theory which schweitzer sought to put into practice in his own life .
according to some authors , schweitzer's thought , and specifically his development of reverence for life , was influenced by indian religious thought and in particular the jain principle of ahimsa , or non-violence .
albert schweitzer noted the contribution of indian influence in his book " indian thought and its development " : after the birth of their daughter ( rhena schweitzer miller ) , albert's wife , helene schweitzer was no longer able to live in lambaréné due to her health .
in *num* the family moved to königsfeld im schwarzwald , baden-württemberg , where he was building a house for the family .
this house is now maintained as a schweitzer museum .
from 1939–48 he stayed in lambaréné , unable to go back to europe because of the war .
three years after the end of world war ii , in *num* , he returned for the first time to europe and kept traveling back and forth ( and once to the us ) as long as he was able .
during his return visits to his home village of gunsbach , schweitzer continued to make use of the family house , which after his death became an archive and museum to his life and work .
his life was portrayed in the *num* movie " il est minuit , docteur schweitzer " , starring pierre fresnay as albert schweitzer and jeanne moreau as his nurse marie .
schweitzer inspired actor hugh o'brian when o'brian visited in africa .
o'brian returned to the united states and founded the hugh o'brian youth leadership foundation ( hoby ) .
schweitzer was awarded the nobel peace prize of *num* , accepting the prize with the speech , " the problem of peace " .
from *num* until his death he worked against nuclear tests and nuclear weapons with albert einstein , otto hahn and bertrand russell .
in *num* and *num* he broadcast four speeches over radio oslo which were published in " peace or atomic war " .
in *num* , schweitzer was one of the founders of the committee for a sane nuclear policy .
on *num* april *num* , schweitzer made his " declaration of conscience " speech ; it was broadcast to the world over radio oslo , pleading for the abolition of nuclear weapons .
his speech ended , " the end of further experiments with atom bombs would be like the early sunrays of hope which suffering humanity is longing for .
" weeks prior to his death , an american film crew was allowed to visit schweitzer and drs .
muntz and friedman , both holocaust survivors , to record his work and daily life at the hospital .
the film " the legacy of albert schweitzer " , narrated by henry fonda , was produced by warner brothers and aired once .
it resides in their vault today in deteriorating condition .
although several attempts have been made to restore and re-air the film , all access has been denied .
in *num* he was made an honorary member of the order of merit ( om ) by queen elizabeth ii .
he was also a chevalier of the military and hospitaller order of saint lazarus of jerusalem .
schweitzer died on *num* september *num* at his beloved hospital in lambaréné , now in independent gabon .
his grave , on the banks of the ogooué river , is marked by a cross he made himself .
his cousin anne-marie schweitzer sartre was the mother of jean-paul sartre .
her father , charles schweitzer , was the older brother of albert schweitzer's father , louis théophile .
schweitzer was a vegetarian .
however , in an account written by dr .
edgar berman , it is suggested that schweitzer consumed fried liver at a sunday dinner in lambaréné .
the albert schweitzer fellowship was founded in *num* by schweitzer to unite us supporters in filling the gap in support for his hospital when his european supply lines were cut off by war , and continues to support the lambaréné hospital today .
schweitzer , however , considered his ethic of reverence for life , not his hospital , his most important legacy , saying that his lambaréné hospital was just " my own improvisation on the theme of reverence for life .
everyone can have their own lambaréné .
" today asf helps large numbers of young americans in health-related professional fields find or create " their own lambaréné " in the us or internationally .
asf selects and supports nearly *num* new us and africa schweitzer fellows each year from over *num* of the leading us schools of medicine , nursing , public health , and every other field with some relation to health ( including music , law , and divinity ) .
the peer-supporting lifelong network of " schweitzer fellows for life " numbered over *num* , *num* members in *num* , and is growing by nearly *num* , *num* every four years .
nearly *num* of these schweitzer fellows have served at the hospital in lambaréné , for three-month periods during their last year of medical school .
the prize was first awarded on *num* may *num* to eugen drewermann and the physician couple rolf and raphaela maibach in königsfeld im schwarzwald , where schweitzer's former residence now houses the albert schweitzer museum .
recordings of schweitzer playing the music of bach are available on cd .
during *num* and *num* he resided in britain , delivering the gifford lectures at edinburgh university , and those on " religion in modern civilization " at oxford and london .
he had originally conducted trials for recordings for hmv on the organ of the old queen's hall in london .
these records did not satisfy him , the instrument being too harsh .
in mid-december *num* he began to record for columbia records on the organ of all hallows , barking-by-the-tower , london .
then at his suggestion the sessions were transferred to the church of ste aurélie in strasbourg , on a mid-18th-century organ by johann andreas silbermann ( brother of gottfried ) , an organ-builder greatly revered by bach , which had been restored by the lorraine organ-builder frédéric härpfer shortly before the first world war .
these recordings were made in the course of a fortnight in october *num* .
schweitzer developed a technique for recording the performances of bach's music .
known as " the schweitzer technique " , it is a slight improvement on what is commonly known as mid-side .
the mid-side sees a figure-8 microphone pointed off-axis , perpendicular to the sound source .
then a single cardioid microphone is placed on axis , bisecting the figure-8 pattern .
the signal from the figure-8 is mult-ed , panned hard left and right , one of the signals being flipped out of polarity .
in the schweitzer method , the figure-8 is replaced by two small diaphragm condenser microphones pointed directly away from each other .
the information that each capsule collects is unique , unlike the identical out-of-polarity information generated from the figure-8 in a regular mid-side .
the on-axis microphone is often a large diaphragm condenser .
the technique has since been used to record many modern instruments .
altogether his early columbia discs included *num* records of bach and eight of césar franck .
the bach titles were mainly distributed as follows : later recordings were made at parish church , günsbach : these recordings were made by c .
robert fine during the time dr .
schweitzer was being filmed in günsbach for the documentary " albert schweitzer .
" fine originally self-released the recordings but later licensed the masters to columbia .
the above were released in the united states as columbia masterworks boxed set sl-175 .
commandant of the marine corps the commandant of the marine corps ( cmc ) is normally the highest-ranking officer in the united states marine corps and is a member of the joint chiefs of staff .
the cmc reports directly to the united states secretary of the navy and is responsible for ensuring the organization , policy , plans , and programs for the marine corps as well as advising the president , the secretary of defense , the national security council , the homeland security council , and the secretary of the navy on matters involving the marine corps .
under the authority of the secretary of the navy , the cmc designates marine personnel and resources to the commanders of unified combatant commands .
the commandant performs all other functions prescribed in section *num* in title *num* of the united states code or delegates those duties and responsibilities to other officers in his administration in his name .
as with the other joint chiefs , the commandant is an administrative position and has no operational command authority over united states marine corps forces .
the commandant is nominated by the president for a four-year term of office and must be confirmed by the senate .
by statute , the commandant is appointed as a four-star general while serving in office .
" the commandant is directly responsible to the secretary of the navy for the total performance of the marine corps .
this includes the administration , discipline , internal organization , training , requirements , efficiency , and readiness of the service .
the commandant is also responsible for the operation of the marine corps material support system .
" since *num* , the official residence of the commandant has been located in the marine barracks in washington , d .
c .
and his main offices are in arlington county , virginia .
the responsibilities of the commandant are outlined in title *num* , section *num* , the united states code and the position is " subject to the authority , direction , and control of the secretary of the navy .
" as stated in the u .
s .
code , the commandant " shall preside over the headquarters , marine corps , transmit the plans and recommendations of the headquarters , marine corps , to the secretary and advise the secretary with regard to such plans and recommendations , after approval of the plans or recommendations of the headquarters , marine corps , by the secretary , act as the agent of the secretary in carrying them into effect , exercise supervision , consistent with the authority assigned to commanders of unified or specified combatant commands under chapter *num* of this title , over such of the members and organizations of the marine corps and the navy as the secretary determines , perform the duties prescribed for him by section *num* of this title and other provisions of law and perform such other military duties , not otherwise assigned by law , as are assigned to him by the president , the secretary of defense , or the secretary of the navy .
" thirty-seven men have served as the commandant of the marine corps .
the first commandant was samuel nicholas , who took office as a captain , though there was no office titled " commandant " at the time , and the second continental congress had authorized that the senior-most marine could take a rank up to colonel .
the longest-serving was archibald henderson , sometimes referred to as the " "grand old man of the marine corps" " due to his thirty-nine-year tenure .
in the history of the united states marine corps , only one commandant has ever been fired from the job : anthony gale , as a result of a court-martial in *num* .
abbot abbot , meaning father , is an ecclesiastical title given to the male head of a monastery in various traditions , including christianity .
the office may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not the head of a monastery .
the female equivalent is abbess .
the title had its origin in the monasteries of egypt and syria , spread through the eastern mediterranean , and soon became accepted generally in all languages as the designation of the head of a monastery .
the word is derived from the aramaic " av " meaning " father " or " abba " , meaning " my father " .
in the septuagint , it was written as " abbas " .
at first it was employed as a respectful title for any monk , but it was soon restricted by canon law to certain priestly superiors .
at times it was applied to various priests , e .
g .
at the court of the frankish monarchy the " abbas palatinus " ( " of the palace " ' ) and " abbas castrensis " ( " of the camp " ) were chaplains to the merovingian and carolingian sovereigns’ court and army respectively .
the title abbot came into fairly general use in western monastic orders whose members include priests .
an abbot ( from old english " abbod " , " abbad " , from latin " abbas " ( “father” ) , from ancient greek " ἀββᾶς " ( abbas ) , from aramaic " ܐܒܐ" / "אבא " ( ’abbā , “father” ) ; confer german " abt " ; french " abbé " ) is the head and chief governor of a community of monks , called also in the east " hegumen " or " archimandrite " .
the english version for a female monastic head is abbess .
in egypt , the first home of monasticism , the jurisdiction of the abbot , or archimandrite , was but loosely defined .
sometimes he ruled over only one community , sometimes over several , each of which had its own abbot as well .
saint john cassian speaks of an abbot of the thebaid who had *num* monks under him .
by the rule of st benedict , which , until the cluniac reforms , was the norm in the west , the abbot has jurisdiction over only one community .
the rule , as was inevitable , was subject to frequent violations ; but it was not until the foundation of the cluniac order that the idea of a supreme abbot , exercising jurisdiction over all the houses of an order , was definitely recognised .
monks , as a rule , were laymen , nor at the outset was the abbot any exception .
for the reception of the sacraments , and for other religious offices , the abbot and his monks were commanded to attend the nearest church .
this rule proved inconvenient when a monastery was situated in a desert or at a distance from a city , and necessity compelled the ordination of some monks .
this innovation was not introduced without a struggle , ecclesiastical dignity being regarded as inconsistent with the higher spiritual life , but , before the close of the *ord* century , at least in the east , abbots seem almost universally to have become deacons , if not priests .
the change spread more slowly in the west , where the office of abbot was commonly filled by laymen till the end of the *ord* century .
the ecclesiastical leadership exercised by abbots despite their frequent lay status is proved by their attendance and votes at ecclesiastical councils .
thus at the first council of constantinople , ad *num* , *num* archimandrites or abbots sign , with *num* bishops .
the second council of nicaea , ad *num* , recognized the right of abbots to ordain their monks to the inferior orders below the diaconate , a power usually reserved to bishops .
abbots used to be subject to episcopal jurisdiction , and continued generally so , in fact , in the west till the *ord* century .
the code of justinian ( lib .
i .
tit .
iii .
de ep .
leg .
xl .
) expressly subordinates the abbot to episcopal oversight .
the first case recorded of the partial exemption of an abbot from episcopal control is that of faustus , abbot of lerins , at the council of arles , ad *num* ; but the exorbitant claims and exactions of bishops , to which this repugnance to episcopal control is to be traced , far more than to the arrogance of abbots , rendered it increasingly frequent , and , in the *ord* century , the practice of exempting religious houses partly or altogether from episcopal control , and making them responsible to the pope alone , received an impulse from pope gregory the great .
these exceptions , introduced with a good object , had grown into a widespread evil by the *ord* century , virtually creating an " imperium in imperio , " and depriving the bishop of all authority over the chief centres of influence in his diocese .
in the *ord* century , the abbots of fulda claimed precedence of the archbishop of cologne .
abbots more and more assumed almost episcopal state , and in defiance of the prohibition of early councils and the protests of st bernard and others , adopted the episcopal insignia of mitre , ring , gloves and sandals .
it has been maintained that the right to wear mitres was sometimes granted by the popes to abbots before the *ord* century , but the documents on which this claim is based are not genuine ( j .
braun , " liturgische gewandung " , p .
*num* ) .
the first undoubted instance is the bull by which alexander ii in *num* granted the use of the mitre to egelsinus , abbot of the monastery of st augustine at canterbury .
the mitred abbots in england were those of abingdon , st alban's , bardney , battle , bury st edmunds , st augustine's canterbury , colchester , croyland , evesham , glastonbury , gloucester , st benet's hulme , hyde , malmesbury , peterborough , ramsey , reading , selby , shrewsbury , tavistock , thorney , westminster , winchcombe , and st mary's york .
of these the precedence was yielded to the abbot of glastonbury , until in ad *num* adrian iv ( nicholas breakspear ) granted it to the abbot of st alban's , in which monastery he had been brought up .
next after the abbot of st alban's ranked the abbot of westminster and then ramsey .
elsewhere , the mitred abbots that sat in the estates of scotland were of arbroath , cambuskenneth , coupar angus , dunfermline , holyrood , iona , kelso , kilwinning , kinloss , lindores , paisley , melrose , scone , st andrews priory and sweetheart .
to distinguish abbots from bishops , it was ordained that their mitre should be made of less costly materials , and should not be ornamented with gold , a rule which was soon entirely disregarded , and that the crook of their pastoral staff ( the crosier ) should turn inwards instead of outwards , indicating that their jurisdiction was limited to their own house .
the adoption of certain episcopal insignia ( pontificalia ) by abbots was followed by an encroachment on episcopal functions , which had to be specially but ineffectually guarded against by the lateran council , ad *num* .
in the east abbots , if in priests ' orders and with the consent of the bishop , were , as we have seen , permitted by the second nicene council , ad *num* , to confer the tonsure and admit to the order of reader ; but gradually abbots , in the west also , advanced higher claims , until we find them in ad *num* permitted by innocent iv to confer both the subdiaconate and diaconate .
of course , they always and everywhere had the power of admitting their own monks and vesting them with the religious habit .
the power of the abbot was paternal but absolute , limited , however , by the canon law .
one of the main goals of monasticism was the purgation of self and selfishness , and obedience was seen as a path to that perfection .
it was sacred duty to execute the abbot's orders , and even to act without his orders was sometimes considered a transgression .
examples among the egyptian monks of this submission to the commands of the superiors , exalted into a virtue by those who regarded the entire crushing of the individual will as a goal , are detailed by cassian and others , e .
g .
a monk watering a dry stick , day after day , for months , or endeavoring to remove a huge rock immensely exceeding his powers .
when a vacancy occurred , the bishop of the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the convent , but the right of election was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves , reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new abbot .
in abbeys exempt from the ( arch ) bishop's diocesan jurisdiction , the confirmation and benediction had to be conferred by the pope in person , the house being taxed with the expenses of the new abbot's journey to rome .
it was necessary that an abbot should be at least *num* years of age , of legitimate birth , a monk of the house for at least *num* years , unless it furnished no suitable candidate , when a liberty was allowed of electing from another convent , well instructed himself , and able to instruct others , one also who had learned how to command by having practised obedience .
in some exceptional cases an abbot was allowed to name his own successor .
cassian speaks of an abbot in egypt doing this ; and in later times we have another example in the case of st bruno .
popes and sovereigns gradually encroached on the rights of the monks , until in italy the pope had usurped the nomination of all abbots , and the king in france , with the exception of cluny , premontré and other houses , chiefs of their order .
the election was for life , unless the abbot was canonically deprived by the chiefs of his order , or when he was directly subject to them , by the pope or the bishop , and also in england it was for a term of 8–12 years .
the ceremony of the formal admission of a benedictine abbot in medieval times is thus prescribed by the consuetudinary of abingdon .
the newly elected abbot was to put off his shoes at the door of the church , and proceed barefoot to meet the members of the house advancing in a procession .
after proceeding up the nave , he was to kneel and pray at the topmost step of the entrance of the choir , into which he was to be introduced by the bishop or his commissary , and placed in his stall .
the monks , then kneeling , gave him the kiss of peace on the hand , and rising , on the mouth , the abbot holding his staff of office .
he then put on his shoes in the vestry , and a chapter was held , and the bishop or his delegate preached a suitable sermon .
before the late modern era , the abbot was treated with the utmost reverence by the brethren of his house .
when he appeared either in church or chapter all present rose and bowed .
his letters were received kneeling , as were those of the pope and the king .
no monk might sit in his presence , or leave it without his permission , reflecting the hierarchical etiquette of families and society .
the highest place was assigned to him , both in church and at table .
in the east he was commanded to eat with the other monks .
in the west the rule of st benedict appointed him a separate table , at which he might entertain guests and strangers .
because this permission opened the door to luxurious living , synods of aachen ( 816–819 ) , decreed that the abbot should dine in the refectory , and be content with the ordinary fare of the monks , unless he had to entertain a guest .
these ordinances proved , however , generally ineffectual to secure strictness of diet , and contemporaneous literature abounds with satirical remarks and complaints concerning the inordinate extravagance of the tables of the abbots .
when the abbot condescended to dine in the refectory , his chaplains waited upon him with the dishes , a servant , if necessary , assisting them .
when abbots dined in their own private hall , the rule of st benedict charged them to invite their monks to their table , provided there was room , on which occasions the guests were to abstain from quarrels , slanderous talk and idle gossiping .
the ordinary attire of the abbot was according to rule to be the same as that of the monks .
but by the *ord* century the rule was commonly set aside , and we find frequent complaints of abbots dressing in silk , and adopting sumptuous attire .
some even laid aside the monastic habit altogether , and assumed a secular dress .
with the increase of wealth and power , abbots had lost much of their special religious character , and become great lords , chiefly distinguished from lay lords by celibacy .
thus we hear of abbots going out to hunt , with their men carrying bows and arrows ; keeping horses , dogs and huntsmen ; and special mention is made of an abbot of leicester , c .
*num* , who was the most skilled of all the nobility in hare hunting .
in magnificence of equipage and retinue the abbots vied with the first nobles of the realm .
they rode on mules with gilded bridles , rich saddles and housings , carrying hawks on their wrist , followed by an immense train of attendants .
the bells of the churches were rung as they passed .
they associated on equal terms with laymen of the highest distinction , and shared all their pleasures and pursuits .
this rank and power was , however , often used most beneficially .
for instance , we read of richard whiting , the last abbot of glastonbury , judicially murdered by henry viii , that his house was a kind of well-ordered court , where as many as *num* sons of noblemen and gentlemen , who had been sent to him for virtuous education , had been brought up , besides others of a lesser rank , whom he fitted for the universities .
his table , attendance and officers were an honour to the nation .
he would entertain as many as *num* persons of rank at one time , besides relieving the poor of the vicinity twice a week .
he had his country houses and fisheries , and when he travelled to attend parliament his retinue amounted to upwards of *num* persons .
the abbots of cluny and vendôme were , by virtue of their office , cardinals of the roman church .
in the process of time , the title abbot was extended to clerics who had no connection with the monastic system , as to the principal of a body of parochial clergy ; and under the carolingians to the chief chaplain of the king , ' , or military chaplain of the emperor , ' it even came to be adopted by purely secular officials .
thus the chief magistrate of the republic at genoa was called " " .
lay abbots ( m .
lat .
' , ' , ' , ' , ' or ' , ' , or sometimes simply ' ) were the outcome of the growth of the feudal system from the *ord* century onwards .
the practice of commendation , by which—to meet a contemporary emergency—the revenues of the community were handed over to a lay lord , in return for his protection , early suggested to the emperors and kings the expedient of rewarding their warriors with rich abbeys held " in commendam .
" during the carolingian epoch , the custom grew up of granting these as regular heritable fiefs or benefices , and by the *ord* century , before the great cluniac reform , the system was firmly established .
even the abbey of st denis was held in commendam by hugh capet .
the example of the kings was followed by the feudal nobles , sometimes by making a temporary concession permanent , sometimes without any form of commendation whatever .
in england the abuse was rife in the *ord* century , as may be gathered from the acts of the council of cloveshoe .
these lay abbacies were not merely a question of overlordship , but implied the concentration in lay hands of all the rights , immunities and jurisdiction of the foundations , i .
e .
the more or less complete secularization of spiritual institutions .
the lay abbot took his recognized rank in the feudal hierarchy , and was free to dispose of his fief as in the case of any other .
the enfeoffment of abbeys differed in form and degree .
sometimes the monks were directly subject to the lay abbot ; sometimes he appointed a substitute to perform the spiritual functions , known usually as dean ( decanus ) , but also as abbot ( " abbas legitimas " , " monasticus " , " regularis " ) .
when the great reform of the *ord* century had put an end to the direct jurisdiction of the lay abbots , the honorary title of abbot continued to be held by certain of the great feudal families , as late as the *ord* century and later , with the head of the community retaining the title of dean .
the connection of the lesser lay abbots with the abbeys , especially in the south of france , lasted longer ; and certain feudal families retained the title of abbes chevaliers ( abbates milltes ) for centuries , together with certain rights over the abbey lands or revenues .
the abuse was not confined to the west .
john , patriarch of antioch , at the beginning of the *ord* century , informs us that in his time most monasteries had been handed over to laymen , " bencficiarii , " for life , or for part of their lives , by the emperors .
giraldus cambrensis reported ( " itinerary " , ii .
iv ) the common customs of lay abbots in the late 12th-century church of wales : in conventual cathedrals , where the bishop occupied the place of the abbot , the functions usually devolving on the superior of the monastery were performed by a prior .
in the roman catholic church , abbots continue to be elected by the monks of an abbey to lead them as their religious superior in those orders and monasteries that make use of the term ( some orders of monks , as the carthusians for instance , have no abbots , only priors ) .
a monastery must have been granted the status of an abbey by the pope , and such monasteries are normally raised to this level after showing a degree of stability—a certain number of monks in vows , a certain number of years of establishment , a certain firmness to the foundation in economic , vocational and legal aspects .
prior to this , the monastery would be a mere priory , headed by a prior who acts as superior but without the same degree of legal authority that an abbot has .
the abbot is chosen by the monks from among the fully professed monks .
once chosen , he must request blessing : the blessing of an abbot is celebrated by the bishop in whose diocese the monastery is or , with his permission , another abbot or bishop .
the ceremony of such a blessing is similar in some aspects to the consecration of a bishop , with the new abbot being presented with the mitre , the ring , and the crosier as symbols of office and receiving the laying on of hands and blessing from the celebrant .
though the ceremony installs the new abbot into a position of legal authority , it does not confer further sacramental authority- it is not a further degree of holy orders ( although some abbots have been ordained to the episcopacy ) .
once he has received this blessing , the abbot not only becomes father of his monks in a spiritual sense , but their major superior under canon law , and has the additional authority to confer the ministries of acolyte and lector ( formerly , he could confer the minor orders , which are not sacraments , that these ministries have replaced ) .
the abbey is a species of " exempt religious " in that it is , for the most part , answerable to the pope , or to the abbot primate , rather than to the local bishop .
the abbot wears the same habit as his fellow monks , though by tradition he adds to it a pectoral cross .
territorial abbots follow all of the above , but in addition must receive a mandate of authority from the pope over the territory around the monastery for which they are responsible .
in some monastic families , there is a hierarchy of precedence or authority among abbots .
in some cases , this is the result of an abbey being considered the " mother " of several " daughter " abbeys founded as dependent priories of the " mother .
" in other cases , abbeys have affiliated in networks known as " congregations .
" some monastic families recognize one abbey as the motherhouse of the entire order .
the title abbé ( french ; ital .
" abate " ) , as commonly used in the catholic church on the european continent , is the equivalent of the english " father " ( parallel etymology ) , being loosely applied to all who have received the tonsure .
this use of the title is said to have originated in the right conceded to the king of france , by the concordat between pope leo x and francis i ( *num* ) , to appoint " abbés commendataires " to most of the abbeys in france .
the expectation of obtaining these sinecures drew young men towards the church in considerable numbers , and the class of abbés so formed—"abbés de cour " they were sometimes called , and sometimes ( ironically ) " abbés de sainte espérance " , ( abbés of holy hope ; or the jeu de mots , of st .
hope ) —came to hold a recognized position .
the connection many of them had with the church was of the slenderest kind , consisting mainly in adopting the title of abbé , after a remarkably moderate course of theological study , practising celibacy and wearing a distinctive dress—a short dark-violet coat with narrow collar .
being men of presumed learning and undoubted leisure , many of the class found admission to the houses of the french nobility as tutors or advisers .
nearly every great family had its abbé .
the class did not survive the revolution ; but the courtesy title of abbé , having long lost all connection in people's minds with any special ecclesiastical function , remained as a convenient general term applicable to any clergyman .
in the eastern orthodox and eastern catholic churches , the abbot is referred to as the " hegumen " .
the superior of a convent of nuns is called the " hēguménē " .
the title of " archimandrite " ( literally the head of the enclosure ) used to mean something similar .
in the east , the principle set forth in the " corpus juris civilis " still applies , whereby most abbots are immediately subject to the local bishop .
those monasteries which enjoy the status of being " stauropegiac " will be subject only to a primate or his synod of bishops and not the local bishop .
although currently in the western church the title " abbot " is given only abbots of monasteries , the title archimandrite is given to " monastics " ( i .
e .
, celibate ) priests in the east , even when not attached to a monastery , as an honor for service , similar to the title of monsignor in the western / latin rite of the catholic church .
in the orthodox church , only monastics are permitted to be elevated to the rank of archimandrite .
married priests are elevated to the parallel rank of archpriest or protopresbyter .
normally there are no celibate priests who are not monastics in the orthodox church , with the exception of married priests who have been widowed .
since the time of catherine ii the ranks of abbot and archimandrite have been given as honorary titles in the russian church , and may be given to any monastic , even if he does not in fact serve as the superior of a monastery .
in greek practice the title or function of abbot corresponds to a person who serves as the head of a monastery , although the title of the archimandrite may be given to any celibate priest who could serve as the head of a monastery .
in the german evangelical church , the german title of " abt " ( abbot ) is sometimes bestowed , like the french " abbé " , as an honorary distinction , and survives to designate the heads of some monasteries converted at the reformation into collegiate foundations .
of these the most noteworthy is loccum abbey in hanover , founded as a cistercian house in *num* by count wilbrand of hallermund , and reformed in *num* .
the abbot of loccum , who still carries a pastoral staff , takes precedence over all the clergy of hanover , and was " ex officio " a member of the consistory of the kingdom .
the governing body of the abbey consists of the abbot , prior and the " convent " of " stiftsherren " ( canons ) .
in the church of england , the bishop of norwich , by royal decree given by henry viii , also holds the honorary title of " abbot of st .
benet .
" this title hails back to england's separation from the see of rome , when king henry , as supreme head of the newly independent church , took over all of the monasteries , mainly for their possessions , except for st .
benet , which he spared because the abbot and his monks possessed no wealth , and lived like simple beggars , deposing the incumbent bishop of norwich and seating the abbot in his place , thus the dual title still held to this day .
additionally , at the enthronement of the archbishop of canterbury , there is a threefold enthronement , once in the throne the chancel as the diocesan bishop of canterbury , once in the chair of st .
augustine as the primate of all england , and then once in the chapter-house as titular abbot of canterbury .
there are several benedictine abbeys throughout the anglican communion .
most of them have mitred abbots .
"the abbot " is one of the archetypes traditionally illustrated in scenes of " danse macabre " .
the lives of numerous abbots make up a significant contribution to christian hagiography , one of the most well-known being the " life of st .
benedict of nursia " by st .
gregory the great .
during the years 1106–1107 ad , daniel , a russian orthodox abbot , made a pilgrimage to the holy land and recorded his experiences .
his diary was much-read throughout russia , and at least seventy-five manuscript copies survive .
saint joseph , abbot of volokolamsk , russia ( 1439–1515 ) , wrote a number of influential works against heresy , and about monastic and liturgical discipline , and christian philanthropy .
in the " tales of redwall " series , the creatures of redwall are led by an abbot or abbess .
these " abbots " are appointed by the brothers and sisters of redwall to serve as a superior and provide paternal care , much like real abbots .
"the abbot " was a nickname of rza from the wu-tang clan .
abd al-rahman ii abd ar-rahman ii ( ) ( 792–852 ) was the fourth umayyad emir of córdoba in the al-andalus iberia from *num* until his death .
abd ar-rahman ii was born in toledo , the son of emir al-hakam i .
in his youth he took part in the so-called " massacre of the ditch " , when from *num* to *num* , *num* people come to pay homage to the princes who were killed by order of al-hakam .
he succeeded his father as emir of córdoba in *num* and engaged in nearly continuous warfare against alfonso ii of asturias , whose southward advance he halted ( 822–842 ) .
in *num* , he suppressed a revolt of christians and jews in toledo .
he issued a decree by which the christians were forbidden to seek martyrdom , and he had a christian synod held to forbid martyrdom .
in *num* , abd ar-rahman repulsed an assault by vikings who had disembarked in cádiz , conquered seville ( with the exception of its citadel ) and attacked córdoba itself .
thereafter he constructed a fleet and naval arsenal at seville to repel future raids .
he responded to william of septimania's requests of assistance in his struggle against charles the bald's nominations .
abd ar-rahman was famous for his public building program in córdoba where he died in *num* .
he made additions to the mosque–cathedral of córdoba .
a vigorous and effective frontier warrior , he was also well known as a patron of the arts .
he was also involved in the execution of the " martyrs of córdoba " .

bristol city football club is a professional football club based in bristol , england .
they currently play in the championship , the second tier of english football .
founded in *num* , they have played their home games at ashton gate since *num* .
the club's highest ever league finish was second in the top flight in 1906–07 .
they were fa cup runners-up in *num* , and won the welsh cup in *num* despite being an english team .
the club have also won the second tier title once , the third tier title four times , the anglo-scottish cup once , and the football league trophy a record three times .
the club's home colours are red and white , and their nickname is the robins – a robin featured on the club's badge from *num* to *num* .
their main rivals are bristol rovers , with whom they contest the bristol derby , and cardiff city , with whom they contest the severnside derby .
the club was founded in *num* as bristol south end and changed their name to bristol city on adopting professionalism three years later when they were admitted into the southern league .
finishing as runners-up in three of the first four seasons , in *num* the club amalgamated with local southern league rivals bedminster f .
c .
, who had been founded as southville in *num* .
city joined the football league in *num* when they became only the third club south of birmingham ( following in the footsteps of woolwich arsenal and luton town ) to perform in the competition .
their first game in the football league was on *num* september *num* at bloomfield road , when blackpool were beaten 2–0 .
winning the second division championship with a record number of points when they became the first club in football league history to win *num* league games in a season ( out of *num* played ) as well as equalling manchester united's achievement of the previous season in winning *num* consecutive games ( a record until *num* , also accomplished by preston north end in 1950–51 ) .
nicknamed the bristol babe at this time , they finished as runners-up in their inaugural first division campaign ( 1906–07 ) as the only southern club to finish in the top two prior to world war i .
three years later they won through to their only fa cup final , though they were somewhat fortunate that a last gasp spot-kick saved them from defeat in the semi-final versus derby county at stamford bridge .
unfortunately , there was no such similar award to help them in the final at the crystal palace ( now the national sports centre ) as manchester united took the honours 1–0 .
after a five-season stay in the top flight , despite winning 1–0 at newcastle at the start of the 1910–11 campaign , failure to beat everton in the season's finale brought city's first ever taste of relegation and it was to be *num* years before top flight status would be regained .
bristol city would then go on to stay in division *num* until *num* years after the first world war had ended , and in that time they reached the semi-finals of the 1919–20 fa cup before being beaten 2–1 by huddersfield town and finished third in the second division in the 1920–21 season .
however , in the next season they were relegated to the third division south .
the 1920s were a rocky time as city bounced between the second division and the southern section of the third division .
the season after city were relegated , they achieved promotion back to the second division , before being relegated back to the southern section of the third division again the following season .
after successive high finishes in the league , they were promoted again in 1926–27 .
however , by the 1930s they had slumped into the lower division and stayed that way until over *num* years after the second world war .
during this stay in the third division south , they won the welsh cup in *num* , beating tranmere rovers in the final .
however , in the same year they also suffered their biggest ever league defeat , a 9–0 loss to coventry city the 1937–38 season was the most successful season for city since they were relegated to the third division , coming second in the league and reaching the final of the third division south cup , before losing 6–2 to reading on aggregate .
they then came eigth in the third division south in the final full season before the war , in which the grandstand of ashton gate was destroyed by a german air raid .
in 1946–47 , city recorded a record league win by beating aldershlt 9–0 , although despite don clark scoring *num* goals in the league , city failed to get promoted that season .
harry dolman became chairman in *num* , a post he would hold for over *num* years .
an engineer who had bought out the firm he worked for , he designed the first set of floodlights installed at ashton gate in the early 1950s .
the late 1950s were a better time for city , with a five-year stay in the second division , a league they returned to for a further spell in *num* .
in *num* , alan dicks was appointed manager , and things gradually began to improve , with promotion to the first division in *num* , ending a 65-year exile from the top flight .
between *num* and *num* city were regular participants in the anglo-scottish cup , winning the trophy in 1977–78 , beating hibernian in the semi-finals , and winning 3–2 on aggregate in the final against st mirren ( managed at the time by a relatively new manager , alex ferguson ) .
st mirren had their revenge two seasons later , with an aggregate 5–1 victory over city to become the only scottish team to win the trophy .
city's second stint in the top flight was less successful than the club's first , with thirteenth position in *num* being their highest finish during this era .
stars of this era included peter cormack , geoff merrick , tom ritchie , clive whitehead , gerry gow , trevor tainton and jimmy mann .
in *num* , the city team went back to the second division in the first of three relegations , their debt mounted and their financial losses increased , with two successive relegations following .
thus , in *num* , they fell into the fourth division , and were declared bankrupt .
a new club was formed and bcfc ( *num* ) ltd acquired the club's player contracts .
the highly paid senior players julian marshall , chris garland , jimmy mann , peter aitken , geoff merrick , david rodgers , gerry sweeney and trevor tainton , who became known as the ' ashton gate eight ' , each accepted termination of his contract for half the amount due .
the club's previous owners had failed to pay its debts to many local businesses .
the resulting ill will towards the club made it difficult for the new owners to obtain credit .
city spent two seasons in the fourth division before winning promotion under terry cooper in *num* .
they consolidated themselves in the third division during the latter part of the 1980s , and in *num* cooper's successor joe jordan achieved promotion as third division runners-up to local rivals bristol rovers .
there was a tragedy for the club , however , in that promotion campaign .
in march *num* , two months before the club sealed promotion , striker dean horrix was killed in a car crash barely two weeks after joining the club , and having played three league games for them .
jordan moved to heart of midlothian in september *num* , and his successor jimmy lumsden remained in charge for *num* months before making way for denis smith .
smith's first signing was the 20-year-old arsenal striker andy cole , who was an instant hit with fans .
he was sold to newcastle united in february *num* and later established himself as a world class goalscorer , most prominently with manchester united , where he collected five premier league titles , two fa cups and the european cup .
meanwhile , city remained in the new division one ( no longer the second division after the creation of the premier league in *num* ) and smith moved to oxford united in november *num* .
his successor russell osman was sacked within a year , being an unpopular figure with fans .
one of osman's few successful moments with city came in january *num* when he led them to a shock 1–0 victory over liverpool at anfield in a third round replay in the fa cup , a result that would cause the liverpool manager at the time , graeme souness , to resign .
joe jordan was brought back to ashton gate in september *num* , but was unable to prevent relegation to division two .
jordan remained at the helm for two seasons after city's relegation , but left in march *num* after failing to get them back into division one .
former bristol rovers manager john ward took over , and achieved promotion in *num* as division two runners-up .
but city struggled back in division one , and ward stepped down in october *num* to be succeeded by benny lennartsson , their first non-british manager .
city were relegated in bottom place and lennartsson was dismissed in favour of gillingham's tony pulis , who lasted six months before leaving to take over at portsmouth .
during his time at ashton gate he was manager of perhaps the worst city side since the one that completed a hat-trick of successive relegations almost *num* years earlier .
coach tony fawthrop took over until the end of the season , when danny wilson was appointed .
wilson was arguably the most prominent manager to take charge of a city side since denis smith , as he had guided barnsley to promotion to the premier league in *num* and sheffield wednesday to a 12th-place finish in *num* .
the early 2000s were a frustrating time for bristol city .
they were regular division two playoff contenders during wilson's spell as manager .
they just missed out on the playoffs in *num* , finishing *ord* .
the following year , wilson almost took them to automatic promotion , finishing *ord* and winning the football league trophy in cardiff in *num* .
the taste of the play-offs was bitter though , losing to rivals cardiff city 1–0 on aggregate in the semi-final .
in his final year – *num* – they finished in *ord* place again , and this time they reached the playoff final , but lost to brighton & hove albion .
he was sacked within days and replaced by veteran player brian tinnion .
city just failed to make the playoffs in tinnion's first season as manager , finishing seventh , and he stepped down in september *num* after a poor start to the season .
city's form had slumped despite the addition of high-profile players , including marcus stewart and michael bridges .
yeovil town manager gary johnson was recruited as his successor .
johnson arrived in september *num* , making the move from yeovil town , with whom he had gained two promotions .
initial results were poor , but johnson was soon able to recover the season and finish in a comfortable *ord* place .
in the 2006–07 season , bristol city finally achieved the elusive promotion that had evaded them in their *num* years in the third tier .
promotion to the championship was confirmed on the final day of the season with a 3–1 win against already relegated rotherham united , securing the runners-up place in the division and resulting in automatic promotion and joyous scenes of celebration .
after a good start in the championship , city established themselves as real contenders , sitting in *ord* place at christmas .
by the start of march , city were top of the championship , making an improbable *ord* successive promotion a possibility .
however , a poor run ended city's chances of an automatic promotion place but qualified for the play-offs with a 4th-place finish , their highest finish since *num* .
city overcame crystal palace 4–2 on aggregate to progress to the play-off final at wembley , where they were beaten 1–0 by hull city .
after a poor start in the first half of the 2008–09 season , city recovered after christmas , peaking at *ord* place in late february .
after a lot of draws , the season eventually petered out and city finished the season in tenth place .
the 2009–10 season saw some good results in the autumn , but heavy defeats by local rivals cardiff city ( 0–6 ) and doncaster rovers ( 2–5 ) in early *num* led to much dissatisfaction amongst fans , and johnson left the club on *num* march *num* .
assistant manager keith millen took charge as caretaker manager , and led a series of good results , resulting in a second successive tenth-place finish .
steve coppell became manager in *num* but resigned after just two matches .
longtime assistant manager keith millen was announced as coppell's successor and city laboured to a 15th-place finish in 2010–11 .
after a poor start to the 2011–12 season , millen left the club in october *num* .
derek mcinnes was appointed next , but after a promising start , city fell into the relegation zone , eventually surviving in *ord* place , their worst since promotion in *num* .
this steady decline would continue and after a poor start to the 2012–13 season , mcinnes was sacked in january *num* with city bottom of the championship .
he was replaced by sean o'driscoll , the club's fifth head coach in three years , but city were relegated to league one after six seasons in the championship .
o'driscoll left with the team *ord* in league one .
steve cotterill joined the club , which ushered in the start of the revival .
when he joined , the club were bottom of league one .
cotterill guided the club to safety and finished the season *ord* .
had the season started when steve cotterill joined the club , bristol city would have finished *ord* , showing the scale of the turnaround .
bristol city were promoted back to championship for 2015–16 season after securing the 2014–15 football league one title , their first league title since *num* .
in their last home game , against walsall , they finished the season in style , winning 8–2 .
bristol city finished the season with *num* points , the most points in a single season in the club's history , and only *num* losses .
in the same season , they also won the *num* johnstone's paint trophy after a win over walsall , which finished 2–0 and their third league trophy , a record held by the club for having the most wins in that competition .
despite huge success in the previous season , the club struggled on their return to the second tier .
steve cotterill was relieved of his duties in january *num* after a poor run of form which had seen bristol city slip to *ord* in the championship table .
lee johnson , former player and son of former manager , gary johnson , was appointed as bristol city's new head coach on *num* february *num* .
bristol city eventually finished in 18th-place .
bristol city started the 2016–17 season well , and after *num* games they were fifth in the league table , and city also appeared in the last *num* of the league cup for the first time since the 1988–89 season .
however , a sharp downturn in fortunes followed over the winter , and city were only just able to accumulate enough points to ensure survival at the end of the season .
lee johnson remained at the helm for the following season , again making a good early start .
at the midpoint of the season , after *num* league games , they sat *ord* in the championship , whilst also knocking out premier league opposition in watford , stoke city , crystal palace and manchester united to reach the semi-finals of the league cup .
however , a bad run of form followed and city finished the season in *ord* place .
note : the numbers in parentheses are the tier of football for that season .
league cups source for 1970s winners : bristol city have played in red and white since the 1890s , occasionally also including black .
the away kit is more variable .
it is traditionally white , but has also frequently black or yellow .
other colours featured have included green and a purple and lime combination , the latter of which has become a fan favourite .
about halfway through the 2007–08 season bristol city manager gary johnson said in an interview that he hoped the team could get the whole ground bouncing .
city supporters took this rallying cry on board and began to sing " johnson says bounce around the ground " to the tune of yellow submarine , while continually bouncing up and down .
the first game at which it was sung was in an away match against southampton at st mary's stadium , and it was also sung at away at queen's park rangers in february .
when bristol city fans travelled to london to play charlton athletic on *num* march *num* , the visiting fans , using the rail network to return home , adapted the song to " bounce around the train " .
since then , it has become an often used chant at ashton gate stadium by the fans , and city manager gary johnson has even joined in with the bouncing himself .
it was also sometimes used by supporters of gary johnson's former side northampton town , primarily at away matches .
when gary johnson's son , lee johnson returned to his former club in *num* as their new manager , he stated that he wished to inherit the chant and keep the fans singing it .
bristol city's traditional rivals are bristol rovers .
the clubs have met *num* times , with the first meeting in *num* .
bristol city have the most wins on *num* .
however , the clubs have not been in the same league for a number of years ; they were last in the same division in the 2000–01 season .
since then , they have only met three times ; in the two-legged southern final of the 2006–07 football league trophy , which rovers won 1–0 on aggregate , and in the first round of the 2013–14 johnstone's paint trophy , which city won 2–1 at ashton gate .
city's other main rivals are cardiff city , who play in nearby cardiff .
despite being a local derby , it crosses the wales-england border , making it one of the few international club derbies in the united kingdom .
the two clubs have been at similar levels in recent years , being in the same division for *num* of the last *num* seasons .
this has meant frequent meetings in the league including in the semi-finals of the *num* second division play-offs .
other clubs have been seen as ' third rivals ' by the fans and media .
swindon town are seen by many as rivals , nicknamed ' swindle ' by city fans .
this rivalry was most recently relevant in the 2014–15 season , when the two clubs were rivals for promotion to the championship .
plymouth argyle have also previously been considered rivals despite a distance of over *num* miles .
the rivalry was especially relevant in the 2000s when the two clubs were the highest ranking west country clubs for a number of years , and meetings were seen as a decider of the ' best in the west ' .
swansea city and even yeovil town have previously been mentioned as rivals , but very rarely .

clarke's three laws british science fiction writer arthur c .
clarke formulated three adages that are known as clarke's three laws , of which the third law is the best known and most widely cited .
they were part of his ideas in his extensive writings about the future .
these so-called laws include : one account claimed that clarke's " laws " were developed after the editor of his works in french started numbering the author's assertions .
all three laws appear in clarke's essay " hazards of prophecy : the failure of imagination " , first published in " profiles of the future " ( *num* ) .
however , they were not published at the same time .
clarke's first law was proposed in the *num* edition of the essay , as " clarke's law " in " profiles of the future " .
the second law is offered as a simple observation in the same essay but its status as clarke's second law was conferred by others .
it was initially a derivative of the first law and formally became clarke's second law where the author proposed the third law in the *num* revision of " profiles of the future , " which included an acknowledgement " .
" it was also here that clarke wrote about the third law in these words : " as three laws were good enough for newton , i have modestly decided to stop there " .
the third law , despite being latest stated by a decade , is the best known and most widely cited .
it appears only in the *num* revision of the " hazards of prophecy " essay .
it echoes a statement in a *num* story by leigh brackett : " witchcraft to the ignorant , … simple science to the learned " .
earlier examples of this sentiment may be found in " wild talents " ( *num* ) by charles fort : " .
.
.
a performance that may some day be considered understandable , but that , in these primitive times , so transcends what is said to be the known that it is what i mean by magic , " and in the short story " the hound of death " ( *num* ) by agatha christie : " the supernatural is only the natural of which the laws are not yet understood .
" clarke gave an example of the third law when he said that while he " would have believed anyone who told him back in *num* that there would one day exist a book-sized object capable of holding the content of an entire library , he would never have accepted that the same device could find a page or word in a second and then convert it into any typeface and size from albertus extra bold to zurich calligraphic " , referring to his memory of " seeing and hearing linotype machines which slowly converted ‘molten lead into front pages that required two men to lift them’ " .
a fourth law has been proposed for the canon , despite clarke's declared intention of stopping at three laws .
geoff holder quotes : " for every expert , there is an equal and opposite expert , " which is part of american economist thomas sowell's " for every expert , there is an equal and opposite expert , but for every fact there is not necessarily an equal and opposite fact " , from his *num* book " the vision of the anointed " .
endocrinology endocrinology ( from " endocrine " + " -ology " ) is a branch of biology and medicine dealing with the endocrine system , its diseases , and its specific secretions known as hormones .
it is also concerned with the integration of developmental events proliferation , growth , and differentiation , and the psychological or behavioral activities of metabolism , growth and development , tissue function , sleep , digestion , respiration , excretion , mood , stress , lactation , movement , reproduction , and sensory perception caused by hormones .
specializations include behavioral endocrinology and comparative endocrinology .
the endocrine system consists of several glands , all in different parts of the body , that secrete hormones directly into the blood rather than into a duct system .
hormones have many different functions and modes of action ; one hormone may have several effects on different target organs , and , conversely , one target organ may be affected by more than one hormone .
endocrinology is the study of the endocrine system in the human body .
this is a system of glands which secrete hormones .
hormones are chemicals which affect the actions of different organ systems in the body .
examples include thyroid hormone , growth hormone , and insulin .
the endocrine system involves a number of feedback mechanisms , so that often one hormone ( such as thyroid stimulating hormone ) will control the action or release of another secondary hormone ( such as thyroid hormone ) .
if there is too much of the secondary hormone , it may provide negative feedback to the primary hormone , maintaining homeostasis .
in the original *num* definition by bayliss and starling ( see below ) , they specified that , to be classified as a hormone , a chemical must be produced by an organ , be released ( in small amounts ) into the blood , and be transported by the blood to a distant organ to exert its specific function .
this definition holds for most " classical " hormones , but there are also paracrine mechanisms ( chemical communication between cells within a tissue or organ ) , autocrine signals ( a chemical that acts on the same cell ) , and intracrine signals ( a chemical that acts within the same cell ) .
a neuroendocrine signal is a " classical " hormone that is released into the blood by a neurosecretory neuron ( see article on neuroendocrinology ) .
griffin and ojeda identify three different classes of hormones based on their chemical composition : amines , such as norepinephrine , epinephrine , and dopamine ( catecholamines ) , are derived from single amino acids , in this case tyrosine .
thyroid hormones such as *num* , *num* , 3’-triiodothyronine ( t3 ) and *num* , *num* , 3’ , 5’-tetraiodothyronine ( thyroxine , t4 ) make up a subset of this class because they derive from the combination of two iodinated tyrosine amino acid residues .
peptide hormones and protein hormones consist of three ( in the case of thyrotropin-releasing hormone ) to more than *num* ( in the case of follicle-stimulating hormone ) amino acid residues and can have a molecular mass as large as *num* , *num* grams per mole .
all hormones secreted by the pituitary gland are peptide hormones , as are leptin from adipocytes , ghrelin from the stomach , and insulin from the pancreas .
steroid hormones are converted from their parent compound , cholesterol .
mammalian steroid hormones can be grouped into five groups by the receptors to which they bind : glucocorticoids , mineralocorticoids , androgens , estrogens , and progestogens .
some forms of vitamin d , such as calcitriol , are steroid-like and bind to homologous receptors , but lack the characteristic fused ring structure of true steroids .
although every organ system secretes and responds to hormones ( including the brain , lungs , heart , intestine , skin , and the kidney ) , the clinical specialty of endocrinology focuses primarily on the " endocrine organs " , meaning the organs whose primary function is hormone secretion .
these organs include the pituitary , thyroid , adrenals , ovaries , testes , and pancreas .
an " endocrinologist " is a physician who specializes in treating disorders of the endocrine system , such as diabetes , hyperthyroidism , and many others ( see list of diseases ) .
the medical specialty of endocrinology involves the diagnostic evaluation of a wide variety of symptoms and variations and the long-term management of disorders of deficiency or excess of one or more hormones .
the diagnosis and treatment of endocrine diseases are guided by laboratory tests to a greater extent than for most specialties .
many diseases are investigated through " excitation / stimulation " or " inhibition / suppression " testing .
this might involve injection with a stimulating agent to test the function of an endocrine organ .
blood is then sampled to assess the changes of the relevant hormones or metabolites .
an endocrinologist needs extensive knowledge of clinical chemistry and biochemistry to understand the uses and limitations of the investigations .
a second important aspect of the practice of endocrinology is distinguishing human variation from disease .
atypical patterns of physical development and abnormal test results must be assessed as indicative of disease or not .
diagnostic imaging of endocrine organs may reveal incidental findings called incidentalomas , which may or may not represent disease .
endocrinology involves caring for the person as well as the disease .
most endocrine disorders are chronic diseases that need lifelong care .
some of the most common endocrine diseases include diabetes mellitus , hypothyroidism and the metabolic syndrome .
care of diabetes , obesity and other chronic diseases necessitates understanding the patient at the personal and social level as well as the molecular , and the physician–patient relationship can be an important therapeutic process .
apart from treating patients , many endocrinologists are involved in clinical science and medical research , teaching , and hospital management .
endocrinologists are specialists of internal medicine or pediatrics .
reproductive endocrinologists deal primarily with problems of fertility and menstrual function—often training first in obstetrics .
most qualify as an internist , pediatrician , or gynecologist for a few years before specializing , depending on the local training system .
in the u .
s .
and canada , training for board certification in internal medicine , pediatrics , or gynecology after medical school is called residency .
further formal training to subspecialize in adult , pediatric , or reproductive endocrinology is called a fellowship .
typical training for a north american endocrinologist involves *num* years of college , *num* years of medical school , *num* years of residency , and *num* years of fellowship .
in the us , adult endocrinologists are board certified by the american board of internal medicine ( abim ) or the american osteopathic board of internal medicine ( aobim ) in endocrinology , diabetes and metabolism .
endocrinology also involves study of the diseases of the endocrine system .
these diseases may relate to too little or too much secretion of a hormone , too little or too much action of a hormone , or problems with receiving the hormone .
because endocrinology encompasses so many conditions and diseases , there are many organizations that provide education to patients and the public .
the hormone foundation is the public education affiliate of the endocrine society and provides information on all endocrine-related conditions .
other educational organizations that focus on one or more endocrine-related conditions include the american diabetes association , human growth foundation , american menopause foundation , inc .
, and thyroid foundation of america .
in north america the principal professional organizations of endocrinologists include the endocrine society , the american association of clinical endocrinologists , the american diabetes association , the lawson wilkins pediatric endocrine society , and the american thyroid association .
in the united kingdom , the society for endocrinology and the british society for paediatric endocrinology and diabetes are the main professional organisations .
the european society for paediatric endocrinology is the largest international professional association dedicated solely to paediatric endocrinology .
there are numerous similar associations around the world .
the earliest study of endocrinology began in china .
the chinese were isolating sex and pituitary hormones from human urine and using them for medicinal purposes by *num* bc .
they used many complex methods , such as sublimation of steroid hormones .
another method specified by chinese texts—the earliest dating to 1110—specified the use of saponin ( from the beans of " gleditsia sinensis " ) to extract hormones , but gypsum ( containing calcium sulfate ) was also known to have been used .
although most of the relevant tissues and endocrine glands had been identified by early anatomists , a more humoral approach to understanding biological function and disease was favoured by the ancient greek and roman thinkers such as aristotle , hippocrates , lucretius , celsus , and galen , according to freeman et al .
, and these theories held sway until the advent of germ theory , physiology , and organ basis of pathology in the *ord* century .
in *num* , arnold berthold noted that castrated cockerels did not develop combs and wattles or exhibit overtly male behaviour .
he found that replacement of testes back into the abdominal cavity of the same bird or another castrated bird resulted in normal behavioural and morphological development , and he concluded ( erroneously ) that the testes secreted a substance that " conditioned " the blood that , in turn , acted on the body of the cockerel .
in fact , one of two other things could have been true : that the testes modified or activated a constituent of the blood or that the testes removed an inhibitory factor from the blood .
it was not proven that the testes released a substance that engenders male characteristics until it was shown that the extract of testes could replace their function in castrated animals .
pure , crystalline testosterone was isolated in *num* .
the graves ' disease was named after irish doctor robert james graves , who described a case of goiter with exophthalmos in *num* .
the german karl adolph von basedow also independently reported the same constellation of symptoms in *num* , while earlier reports of the disease were also published by the italians giuseppe flajani and antonio giuseppe testa , in *num* and *num* respectively , and by the english physician caleb hillier parry ( a friend of edward jenner ) in the late *ord* century .
thomas addison was first to describe addison's disease in *num* .
in *num* william bayliss and ernest starling performed an experiment in which they observed that acid instilled into the duodenum caused the pancreas to begin secretion , even after they had removed all nervous connections between the two .
the same response could be produced by injecting extract of jejunum mucosa into the jugular vein , showing that some factor in the mucosa was responsible .
they named this substance " secretin " and coined the term " hormone " for chemicals that act in this way .
joseph von mering and oskar minkowski made the observation in *num* that removing the pancreas surgically led to an increase in blood sugar , followed by a coma and eventual death—symptoms of diabetes mellitus .
in *num* , banting and best realized that homogenizing the pancreas and injecting the derived extract reversed this condition .
neurohormones were first identified by otto loewi in *num* .
he incubated a frog's heart ( innervated with its vagus nerve attached ) in a saline bath , and left in the solution for some time .
the solution was then used to bathe a non-innervated second heart .
if the vagus nerve on the first heart was stimulated , negative inotropic ( beat amplitude ) and chronotropic ( beat rate ) activity were seen in both hearts .
this did not occur in either heart if the vagus nerve was not stimulated .
the vagus nerve was adding something to the saline solution .
the effect could be blocked using atropine , a known inhibitor to heart vagal nerve stimulation .
clearly , something was being secreted by the vagus nerve and affecting the heart .
the " vagusstuff " ( as loewi called it ) causing the myotropic ( muscle enhancing ) effects was later identified to be acetylcholine and norepinephrine .
loewi won the nobel prize for his discovery .
recent work in endocrinology focuses on the molecular mechanisms responsible for triggering the effects of hormones .
the first example of such work being done was in *num* by earl sutherland .
sutherland investigated whether hormones enter cells to evoke action , or stayed outside of cells .
he studied norepinephrine , which acts on the liver to convert glycogen into glucose via the activation of the phosphorylase enzyme .
he homogenized the liver into a membrane fraction and soluble fraction ( phosphorylase is soluble ) , added norepinephrine to the membrane fraction , extracted its soluble products , and added them to the first soluble fraction .
phosphorylase activated , indicating that norepinephrine's target receptor was on the cell membrane , not located intracellularly .
he later identified the compound as cyclic amp ( camp ) and with his discovery created the concept of second-messenger-mediated pathways .
he , like loewi , won the nobel prize for his groundbreaking work in endocrinology .
émile baudot jean-maurice-émile baudot ( ; *num* september *num* – *num* march *num* ) , french telegraph engineer and inventor of the first means of digital communication baudot code , was one of the pioneers of telecommunications .
he invented a multiplexed printing telegraph system that used his code and allowed multiple transmissions over a single line .
the baud unit was named after him .
baudot was born in magneux , haute-marne , france , the son of farmer pierre emile baudot , who later became the mayor of magneux .
his only formal education was at his local primary school , after which he carried out agricultural work on his father's farm before joining the french post & telegraph administration as an apprentice operator in *num* .
the telegraph service trained him in the morse telegraph and also sent him on a four-month course of instruction on the hughes printing telegraph system , which was later to inspire his own system .
after serving briefly during the franco-prussian war , he returned to civilian duties in paris in *num* .
the telegraph service encouraged baudot to develop—on his own time—a system for time-multiplexing several telegraph messages using hughes teleprinters .
he realised that with most printing telegraphs of the period the line is idle for most of the time , apart from the brief intervals when a character is transmitted .
baudot devised one of the first applications of time-division multiplexing in telegraphy .
using synchronized clockwork-powered switches at the transmitting and receiving ends , he was able to transmit five messages simultaneously ; the system was officially adopted by the french post & telegraph administration five years later .
baudot invented his telegraph code in *num* and patented it in *num* .
it was a 5-bit code , with equal on and off intervals , which allowed telegraph transmission of the roman alphabet , punctuation and control signals .
by *num* or *num* ( various sources give both dates ) he had also perfected the electromechanical hardware to transmit his code .
his inventions were based on the printing mechanism from hughes ' instrument , a distributor invented by bernard meyer in *num* , and the five-unit code devised by carl friedrich gauss and wilhelm weber .
baudot combined these , together with original ideas of his own , to produce a complete multiplex system .
on *num* june *num* baudot patented his first printing telegraph ( patent no .
*num* , *num* " système de télégraphie rapide " ) , in which the signals were translated automatically into typographic characters .
baudot's hardware had three main parts : the keyboard , the distributor , and a paper tape .
each operator - there were as many as four - was allocated a single sector .
the keyboard had just five piano type keys , operated with two fingers of the left hand and three fingers of the right hand .
the five unit code was designed to be easy to remember .
once the keys had been pressed they were locked down until the contacts again passed over the sector connected to that particular keyboard , when the keyboard was unlocked ready for the next character to be entered , with an audible click ( known as the " cadence signal " ) to warn the operator .
operators had to maintain a steady rhythm , and the usual speed of operation was *num* words per minute .
the receiver was also connected to the distributor .
the signals from the telegraph line were temporarily stored on a set of five electromagnets , before being decoded to print the corresponding character on paper tape .
accurate operation of this system depended on the distributor at the transmitting end keeping in synchronization with the one at the receiving end and operators only sending characters when the contacts passed over their allocated sector .
this could be achieved at a speed of *num* wpm by strictly observing the " cadence " of rhythm of the system when the distributor gave the operator the use of the line .
the baudot system was accepted by the french telegraph administration in *num* , with the first online tests of his system occurring between paris and bordeaux on *num* november *num* .
at the end of *num* , the paris-rome line , which was about , began operating a duplex baudot .
the baudot apparatus was shown at the paris exposition universelle ( *num* ) and won him the exposition's gold medal , as well as bringing his system to worldwide notice .
after the first success of his system , baudot was promoted to controller in *num* , and was named inspector-engineer in *num* .
in july *num* he conducted successful tests on the atlantic telegraph cable between weston-super-mare and waterville , nova scotia operated by the commercial company , with a double baudot installed in duplex , the baudot transmitters and receivers substituted for the recorder .
on *num* august *num* he established communications between paris , vannes , and lorient over a single wire .
on *num* january *num* he installed a triplex apparatus on the telegraph between paris and bordeaux that had previously been operating with some difficulty on the hughes telegraph system .
on *num* april *num* he established communications between the paris stock exchange and the milan stock exchange , again over a single wire , using his new invention , the retransmitter .
in *num* the baudot system was improved by switching to punched tape , which was prepared offline like the morse tape used with the wheatstone and creed systems .
a tape reader , controlled by the baudot distributor , then replaced the manual keyboard .
the tape had five rows of holes for the code , with a sixth row of smaller holes for transporting the tape through the reader mechanism .
baudot’s code was later standardised as international telegraph alphabet number one .
baudot received little help from the french telegraph administration for his system , and often had to fund his own research , even having to sell the gold medal awarded by the *num* exposition universelle in *num* .
the baudot telegraph system was employed progressively in france , and then was adopted in other countries , italy being the first to introduce it , in its inland service , in *num* .
the netherlands followed in *num* , switzerland in *num* , and austria and brazil in *num* .
the british post office adopted it for a simplex circuit between london and paris during *num* , then used it for more general purposes from *num* .
in *num* it was adopted by germany , by russia in *num* , the british west indies in *num* , spain in *num* , belgium in *num* , argentina in *num* , and romania in *num* .
baudot married marie josephine adelaide langrognet on *num* january *num* .
she died only three months later , on *num* april *num* .
soon after starting work with the telegraph service , baudot began to suffer physical discomfort and was frequently absent from work for this reason , for as long as a month on one occasion .
his condition affected him for the rest of his life , until he died on *num* march *num* , at sceaux , hauts-de-seine , near paris , at the age of *num* .
in *num* , french telegraph operator louis victor mimault patented a telegraph system using five separate lines to transmit .
after his patent was rejected by the telegraph administration , mimault modified his device to incorporate features from the meyer telegraph and obtained a new patent which was also rejected .
in the meantime , baudot had patented his prototype telegraph a few weeks earlier .
mimault claimed priority of invention over baudot and brought a patent suit against him in *num* .
the tribunal civil de la seine , which reviewed testimony from three experts unconnected with the telegraph administration , found in favor of mimault and accorded him priority of invention of the baudot code and ruled that baudot's patents were simply improvements of mimault's .
neither inventor was satisfied with this judgment , which was eventually rescinded with mimault being ordered to pay all legal costs .
mimault became unnerved because of the decision , and after an incident where he shot at and wounded two students of the école polytechnique ( charges for which were dropped ) , he demanded a special act to prolong the duration of his patents , *num* , *num* francs , and election to the légion d'honneur .
a commission directed by jules raynaud ( head of telegraph research ) rejected his demands .
upon hearing the decision , mimault shot and killed raynaud , and was sentenced to *num* years forced labour and *num* years of exile .
cairo cairo ( ; " " , ; " kashromi " ) is the capital of egypt .
the city's metropolitan area is one of the largest in africa , the largest in the middle east , and the *ord* in the world , and is associated with ancient egypt , as the famous giza pyramid complex and the ancient city of memphis are located in its geographical area .
located near the nile delta , modern cairo was founded in *num* ce by the fatimid dynasty , but the land composing the present-day city was the site of ancient national capitals whose remnants remain visible in parts of old cairo .
cairo has long been a centre of the region's political and cultural life , and is titled " the city of a thousand minarets " for its preponderance of islamic architecture .
cairo is considered a world city with a " beta + " classification according to gawc .
cairo has the oldest and largest film and music industries in the arab world , as well as the world's second-oldest institution of higher learning , al-azhar university .
many international media , businesses , and organizations have regional headquarters in the city ; the arab league has had its headquarters in cairo for most of its existence .
with a population of over *num* million spread over , cairo is by far the largest city in egypt .
an additional *num* .
*num* million inhabitants live in close proximity to the city .
cairo , like many other megacities , suffers from high levels of pollution and traffic .
cairo's metro , one of two in africa ( the other being in algiers , algeria ) , ranks among the fifteen busiest in the world , with over *num* billion annual passenger rides .
the economy of cairo was ranked first in the middle east in *num* , and *ord* globally on " foreign policy " *num* global cities index .
egyptians often refer to cairo as ' ( ; ) , the egyptian arabic name for egypt itself , emphasizing the city's importance for the country .
its official name ' ( ) means " the vanquisher " or " the conqueror " , supposedly due to the fact that the planet mars , " an-najm al-qāhir " ( , " the conquering star " ) , was rising at the time when the city was founded , possibly also in reference to the much awaited arrival of the fatimid caliph al-mu'izz who reached cairo in *num* from mahdia , the old fatimid capital .
the location of the ancient city of heliopolis is the suburb of ain shams ( , " eye of the sun " ) .
the coptic name of the city is " kashromi " ( ) which means " man breaker " ( " ⲕⲁϣ- " – to break , " ⲣⲱⲙⲓ " – man ) which is akin to arabic " " .
sometimes the city is informally referred to as ' by people from alexandria ( ; ) .
the area around present-day cairo , especially memphis that was the old capital of egypt , had long been a focal point of ancient egypt due to its strategic location just upstream from the nile delta .
however , the origins of the modern city are generally traced back to a series of settlements in the first millennium .
around the turn of the *ord* century , as memphis was continuing to decline in importance , the romans established a fortress town along the east bank of the nile .
this fortress , known as babylon , was the nucleus of the roman and then the byzantine city and is the oldest structure in the city today .
it is also situated at the nucleus of the coptic orthodox community , which separated from the roman and byzantine churches in the late *ord* century .
many of cairo's oldest coptic churches , including the hanging church , are located along the fortress walls in a section of the city known as coptic cairo .
following the muslim conquest in *num* ad , the conqueror amr ibn as settled to the north of the babylon in an area that became known as al-fustat .
originally a tented camp ( " fustat " signifies " city of tents " ) fustat became a permanent settlement and the first capital of islamic egypt .
in *num* , following the overthrow of the ummayad caliphate by the abbasids , the new rulers created their own settlement to the northeast of fustat which became their capital .
this was known as al-askar ( the city of sections , or cantonments ) as it was laid out like a military camp .
a rebellion in *num* by ahmad ibn tulun led to the abandonment of al askar and the building of another settlement , which became the seat of government .
this was al-qatta'i ( " the quarters " ) , to the north of fustat and closer to the river .
al qatta'i was centred around a palace and ceremonial mosque , now known as the mosque of ibn tulun .
in *num* , the abbasids re-asserted control of the country and their governor returned to fustat , razing al-qatta'i to the ground .
since 1860s , cairo expanded west as far as what is called now ( midan opera ) in *num* , the fatimids were led by general jawhar al-siqilli to establish a new capital for the fatimid dynasty .
egypt was conquered from their base in ifriqiya and a new fortified city northeast of fustat was established .
it took four years to build the city , initially known as al-manṣūriyyah , which was to serve as the new capital of the caliphate .
during that time , jawhar also commissioned the construction of the al-azhar mosque by order of the caliph , which developed into the third-oldest university in the world .
cairo would eventually become a centre of learning , with the library of cairo containing hundreds of thousands of books .
when caliph al-mu'izz li din allah arrived from the old fatimid capital of mahdia in tunisia in *num* , he gave the city its present name , " al-qāhiratu " ( " the victorious " ) .
for nearly *num* years after cairo was established , the administrative centre of egypt remained in fustat .
however , in *num* the fatimids under the leadership of vizier shawar set fire to fustat to prevent cairo's capture by the crusaders .
egypt's capital was permanently moved to cairo , which was eventually expanded to include the ruins of fustat and the previous capitals of al-askar and al-qatta'i .
as al qahira expanded these earlier settlements were encompassed , and have since become part of the city of cairo as it expanded and spread ; they are now collectively known as " old cairo " .
while the fustat fire successfully protected the city of cairo , a continuing power struggle between shawar , king amalric i of jerusalem , and the zengid general shirkuh led to the downfall of the fatimid establishment .
in *num* , saladin was appointed as the new vizier of egypt by the fatimids and two years later he seized power from the family of the last fatimid caliph , al-'āḍid .
as the first sultan of egypt , saladin established the ayyubid dynasty , based in cairo , and aligned egypt with the abbasids , who were based in baghdad .
during his reign , saladin constructed the cairo citadel , which served as the seat of the egyptian government until the *ord* century .
in *num* , slave soldiers , known as the mamluks , seized control of egypt and like many of their predecessors established cairo as the capital of their new dynasty .
continuing a practice started by the ayyubids , much of the land occupied by former fatimid palaces was sold and replaced by newer buildings .
construction projects initiated by the mamluks pushed the city outward while also bringing new infrastructure to the centre of the city .
meanwhile , cairo flourished as a centre of islamic scholarship and a crossroads on the spice trade route among the civilisations in afro-eurasia .
by *num* , cairo had a population of close to half a million , making it the largest city west of china .
the historic traveler ibn battuta traveled thousands of miles during the course of his trek .
one city he stopped in was cairo , egypt .
one significant note ibn battuta made was that cairo was the principal district of egypt , meaning cairo was egypt's most important and most influential city ( ibn battuta , *num* ) .
ibn battuta also acknowledges the importance of the nile river to all of egypt , including cairo , as he often traveled via boat to arrive at cairo and to leave to continue his journey .
the nile was not just a means for transportation , it was the source of a plethora of other tangibles as well .
the nile's most influential attribute was its ability to sustain rich soil for agriculture .
part of the agricultural revolution thrived in egypt , predominantly off the back of the nile .
the nile also served as a source of food and a pathway for trade .
without it , the egypt we know today wouldn't have been the same .
one of ibn battuta's most detailed accounts in cairo involves a plague that was devastating the city .
today , this plague is known as the bubonic plague , or the black death .
it is believed to have arrived in egypt in *num* , and as ibn battuta recalls , the bubonic plague was responsible for the deaths of between *num* and *num* , *num* people a day in cairo ( berkeley orias , *num* ) ( ibn battuta , *num* ) .
the plague originated in asia and spread via flees on rodents , such as rats ( berkeley orias , *num* ) .
the plague would end up spreading to all of eurasia and wiped out any civilizations that were in its path .
it is estimated that somewhere between *num* and *num* million people total died from the plague .
although cairo avoided europe's stagnation during the late middle ages , it could not escape the black death , which struck the city more than fifty times between *num* and *num* .
during its initial , and most deadly waves , approximately *num* , *num* people were killed by the plague , and , by the *ord* century , cairo's population had been reduced to between *num* , *num* and *num* , *num* .
the city's status was further diminished after vasco da gama discovered a sea route around the cape of good hope between *num* and *num* , thereby allowing spice traders to avoid cairo .
cairo's political influence diminished significantly after the ottomans supplanted mamluk power over egypt in *num* .
ruling from constantinople , sultan selim i relegated egypt to a province , with cairo as its capital .
for this reason , the history of cairo during ottoman times is often described as inconsequential , especially in comparison to other time periods .
however , during the *ord* and *ord* centuries , cairo remained an important economic and cultural centre .
although no longer on the spice route , the city facilitated the transportation of yemeni coffee and indian textiles , primarily to anatolia , north africa , and the balkans .
cairene merchants were instrumental in bringing goods to the barren hejaz , especially during the annual hajj to mecca .
it was during this same period that al-azhar university reached the predominance among islamic schools that it continues to hold today ; pilgrims on their way to hajj often attested to the superiority of the institution , which had become associated with egypt's body of islamic scholars .
by the *ord* century , cairo also had high-rise apartment buildings where the two lower floors were for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were rented out to tenants .
under the ottomans , cairo expanded south and west from its nucleus around the citadel .
the city was the second-largest in the empire , behind constantinople , and , although migration was not the primary source of cairo's growth , twenty percent of its population at the end of the *ord* century consisted of religious minorities and foreigners from around the mediterranean .
still , when napoleon arrived in cairo in *num* , the city's population was less than *num* , *num* , forty percent lower than it was at the height of mamluk—and cairene—influence in the *ord* century .
the french occupation was short-lived as british and ottoman forces , including a sizeable albanian contingent , recaptured the country in *num* .
cairo itself was besieged by a british and ottoman force culminating with the french surrender on *num* june *num* .
the british vacated egypt two years later , leaving the ottomans , the albanians , and the long-weakened mamluks jostling for control of the country .
continued civil war allowed an albanian named muhammad ali pasha to ascend to the role of commander and eventually , with the approval of the religious establishment , viceroy of egypt in *num* .
until his death in *num* , muhammad ali pasha instituted a number of social and economic reforms that earned him the title of founder of modern egypt .
however , while muhammad ali initiated the construction of public buildings in the city , those reforms had minimal effect on cairo's landscape .
bigger changes came to cairo under isma'il pasha ( r .
1863–1879 ) , who continued the modernisation processes started by his grandfather .
drawing inspiration from paris , isma'il envisioned a city of maidans and wide avenues ; due to financial constraints , only some of them , in the area now composing downtown cairo , came to fruition .
isma'il also sought to modernize the city , which was merging with neighboring settlements , by establishing a public works ministry , bringing gas and lighting to the city , and opening a theater and opera house .
the immense debt resulting from isma'il's projects provided a pretext for increasing european control , which culminated with the british invasion in *num* .
the city's economic centre quickly moved west toward the nile , away from the historic islamic cairo section and toward the contemporary , european-style areas built by isma'il .
europeans accounted for five percent of cairo's population at the end of the *ord* century , by which point they held most top governmental positions .
the british occupation was intended to be temporary , but it lasted well into the *ord* century .
nationalists staged large-scale demonstrations in cairo in *num* , five years after egypt had been declared a british protectorate .
nevertheless , while this led to egypt's independence in *num* , british troops remained in the country until *num* .
during this time , urban cairo , spurred by new bridges and transport links , continued to expand to include the upscale neighbourhoods of garden city , zamalek , and heliopolis .
between *num* and *num* , the population of cairo more than tripled—from *num* , *num* to *num* .
*num* million—and its area increased from .
the city was devastated during the *num* riots known as the cairo fire or black saturday , which saw the destruction of nearly *num* shops , movie theatres , casinos and hotels in downtown cairo .
the british departed cairo following the egyptian revolution of *num* , but the city's rapid growth showed no signs of abating .
seeking to accommodate the increasing population , president gamal abdel nasser redeveloped maidan tahrir and the nile corniche , and improved the city's network of bridges and highways .
meanwhile , additional controls of the nile fostered development within gezira island and along the city's waterfront .
the metropolis began to encroach on the fertile nile delta , prompting the government to build desert satellite towns and devise incentives for city-dwellers to move to them .
cairo's population has doubled since the 1960s , reaching close to seven million ( with an additional ten million in its urban area ) .
concurrently , cairo has established itself as a political and economic hub for north africa and the arab world , with many multinational businesses and organisations , including the arab league , operating out of the city .
in *num* , cairo was hit by an earthquake causing *num* deaths , *num* , *num* injuries and *num* , *num* people homeless .
today , cairo serves as the national capital of egypt , so it is fair to say it still holds major importance .
many things have changed since ibn battuta trekked through the city during his travels .
today , cairo has taken a major step forward in urbanization as most cairenes now live in apartment buildings .
because of the influx of people in the city , lone standing houses are rare to find , and apartment buildings accommodate for the limited space and abundance of people .
in fact , lone standing houses are symbolic of the wealthy .
formal education has also become very important to those in the city of cairo .
just as in the united states , there are twelve years of formal education .
cairenes also take an apprehension test similar to the sat to help them further their education and become accepted to a higher institution .
however , most children do not finish school and opt to pick up a trade to enter the work force .
the civil rights movement for women in cairo has been a long and troubling battle for many years now .
women face constant discrimination , harassment , and abuse throughout cairo .
the situation is so bad in cairo that it has even been named the most dangerous megacity for women in the world ( bbc news , *num* ) .
cairo has also been influenced by modern western civilization .
as one travels through modern cairo , it is not unusual to come across mcdonald's , arby's , pizza hut , subway , and kentucky fried chicken .
there are even large scale western restaurants in cairo , such as chili's and t .
g .
i .
friday's .
of course , the majority of restaurants serve egyptian and middle eastern dishes , but the fact remains that certain aspects of western civilization have crossed the atlantic and reached the city of cairo .
sadly , egypt is one of the poorer countries in the middle east , with almost half the population living on $2 or less a day ( hartman , *num* ) .
however , from the income the country does make , most of it does come from cairo , as the majority of the countries manufacturing headquarters are located there .
today's cairo has clearly evolved since ibn battuta made his way through the ancient city .
cairo has made advances in some aspects of daily life , and taken steps backwards in others .
however , with that being said , cairo is still one of the most influential cities in all of egypt .
cairo's tahrir square was the focal point of the *num* egyptian revolution against former president hosni mubarak .
over *num* million protesters were at cairo's tahrir square .
more than *num* , *num* protesters first occupied the square on *num* january , during which the area's wireless services were reported to be impaired .
in the following days tahrir square continued to be the primary destination for protests in cairo as it took place following a popular uprising that began on tuesday , *num* january *num* and continued until june *num* .
the uprising was mainly a campaign of non-violent civil resistance , which featured a series of demonstrations , marches , acts of civil disobedience , and labour strikes .
millions of protesters from a variety of socio-economic and religious backgrounds demanded the overthrow of the regime of egyptian president hosni mubarak .
despite being predominantly peaceful in nature , the revolution was not without violent clashes between security forces and protesters , with at least *num* people killed and *num* , *num* injured .
the uprising took place in cairo , alexandria , and in other cities in egypt , following the tunisian revolution that resulted in the overthrow of the long-time tunisian president zine el abidine ben ali .
on *num* february , following weeks of determined popular protest and pressure , hosni mubarak resigned from office .
under the rule of president el-sisi , in march *num* plans were announced for another yet-unnamed planned city to be built further east of the existing satellite city of new cairo , intended to serve as the new capital of egypt .
cairo is located in northern egypt , known as lower egypt , south of the mediterranean sea and west of the gulf of suez and suez canal .
the city lies along the nile river , immediately south of the point where the river leaves its desert-bound valley and branches into the low-lying nile delta region .
although the cairo metropolis extends away from the nile in all directions , the city of cairo resides only on the east bank of the river and two islands within it on a total area of .
until the *ord* century , when the river was tamed by dams , levees , and other controls , the nile in the vicinity of cairo was highly susceptible to changes in course and surface level .
over the years , the nile gradually shifted westward , providing the site between the eastern edge of the river and the mokattam highlands on which the city now stands .
the land on which cairo was established in *num* ( present-day islamic cairo ) was located underwater just over three hundred years earlier , when fustat was first built .
low periods of the nile during the *ord* century continued to add to the landscape of cairo ; a new island , known as " geziret al-fil " , first appeared in *num* , but eventually became connected to the mainland .
today , the site of " geziret al-fil " is occupied by the shubra district .
the low periods created another island at the turn of the *ord* century that now composes zamalek and gezira .
land reclamation efforts by the mamluks and ottomans further contributed to expansion on the east bank of the river .
because of the nile's movement , the newer parts of the city—garden city , downtown cairo , and zamalek—are located closest to the riverbank .
the areas , which are home to most of cairo's embassies , are surrounded on the north , east , and south by the older parts of the city .
old cairo , located south of the centre , holds the remnants of fustat and the heart of egypt's coptic christian community , coptic cairo .
the boulaq district , which lies in the northern part of the city , was born out of a major 16th-century port and is now a major industrial centre .
the citadel is located east of the city centre around islamic cairo , which dates back to the fatimid era and the foundation of cairo .
while western cairo is dominated by wide boulevards , open spaces , and modern architecture of european influence , the eastern half , having grown haphazardly over the centuries , is dominated by small lanes , crowded tenements , and islamic architecture .
northern and extreme eastern parts of cairo , which include satellite towns , are among the most recent additions to the city , as they developed in the *ord* and *ord* centuries to accommodate the city's rapid growth .
the western bank of the nile is commonly included within the urban area of cairo , but it composes the city of giza and the giza governorate .
giza has also undergone significant expansion over recent years , and today the city , although still a suburb of cairo , has a population of *num* .
*num* million .
the cairo governorate was just north of the helwan governorate from *num* when some cairo's southern districts , including maadi and new cairo , were split off and annexed into the new governorate , to *num* when the helwan governorate was reincorporated into the cairo governorate .
in cairo , and along the nile river valley , the climate is a hot desert climate ( " bwh " according to the köppen climate classification system ) .
wind storms can be frequent , bringing saharan dust into the city , from march to may ( see khamasin ) and the air often becomes uncomfortably dry .
high temperatures in winter range from , while night-time lows drop to below , often to .
in summer , the highs rarely surpass , and lows drop to about .
rainfall is sparse and only happens in the colder months , but sudden showers do cause harsh flooding .
the summer months have high humidity due to its coastal location .
snowfall is extremely rare ; a small amount of graupel , widely believed to be snow , fell on cairo's easternmost suburbs on *num* december *num* , the first time cairo's area received this kind of precipitation in many decades .
dewpoints in the hottest months range from in june to in august .
the greater cairo is the largest metropolitan area in africa .
it consists of cairo governorate , parts of giza governorate , and parts of qalyubia governorate .
*ord* of october city , west of cairo , and new cairo , east of cairo , are major urban developments which have been built to accommodate additional growth and development of the cairo area .
new development includes several high-end residential developments .
tahrir square in march *num* , plans were announced for a yet-unnamed planned city to be built east of cairo , in an undeveloped area of the cairo governorate , which would serve as the administrative and financial capital of egypt .
cairo , as well as neighbouring giza , has been established as egypt's main centre for medical treatment , and despite some exceptions , has the most advanced level of medical care in the country .
cairo's hospitals include the jci-accredited as-salaam international hospital—corniche el nile , maadi ( egypt's largest private hospital with *num* beds ) , ain shams university hospital , dar al fouad , nile badrawi hospital , *num* hospital , as well as qasr el eyni hospital .
greater cairo has long been the hub of education and educational services for egypt and the region .
today , greater cairo is the centre for many government offices governing the egyptian educational system , has the largest number of educational schools , and higher learning institutes among other cities and governorates of egypt .
some of the international schools found in cairo : universities in greater cairo : cairo has an extensive road network , rail system , subway system and maritime services .
road transport is facilitated by personal vehicles , taxi cabs , privately owned public buses and cairo microbuses .
cairo , specifically ramses square , is the centre of almost the entire egyptian transportation network .
the subway system , officially called " metro ( مترو ) " , is a fast and efficient way of getting around cairo .
metro network covers helwan and other suburbs .
it can get very crowded during rush hour .
two train cars ( the fourth and fifth ones ) are reserved for women only , although women may ride in any car they want .
trams in greater cairo and cairo trolleybus are former modes of transportation but were closed .
an extensive road network connects cairo with other egyptian cities and villages .
there is a new ring road that surrounds the outskirts of the city , with exits that reach outer cairo districts .
there are flyovers and bridges , such as the sixth of october bridge that , when the traffic is not heavy , allow fast means of transportation from one side of the city to the other .
cairo traffic is known to be overwhelming and overcrowded .
traffic moves at a relatively fluid pace .
drivers tend to be aggressive , but are more courteous at junctions , taking turns going , with police aiding in traffic control of some congested areas .
football is the most popular sport in egypt , and cairo has a number of sporting teams that compete in national and regional leagues .
the best known teams are al ahly , el zamalek and al-ismaily .
al ahly and el zamalek annual football tournament is perhaps the most watched sports event in egypt as well as the african-arab region .
both teams are known as the " rivals " of egyptian football , and are the first and the second champions in africa and the arab world .
they play their home games at cairo international stadium or naser stadium , which is egypt's *ord* largest stadium , cairo's largest one and one of the largest stadiums in the world .
the cairo international stadium was built in *num* and its multi-purpose sports complex that houses the main football stadium , an indoor stadium , several satellite fields that held several regional , continental and global games , including the african games , u17 football world championship and was one of the stadiums scheduled that hosted the *num* africa cup of nations which was played in january *num* .
egypt later won the competition and went on to win the next edition in ghana ( *num* ) making the egyptian and ghanaian national teams the only teams to win the african nations cup back to back which resulted in egypt winning the title for a record number of six times in the history of african continental competition .
this was followed by a third consecutive win in angola *num* , making egypt the only country with a record 3-consecutive and 7-total continental football competition winner .
this achievement had also placed the egyptian football team as the #9 best team in the world's fifa rankings .
cairo failed at the applicant stage when bidding for the *num* summer olympic games , which was hosted in beijing , china .
however , cairo did host the *num* pan arab games .
there are several other sports teams in the city that participate in several sports including el gezira sporting club , el shams club , el seid club , heliopolis club and several smaller clubs , but the biggest clubs in egypt ( not in area but in sports ) are al ahly and al zamalek .
they have the two biggest football teams in egypt .
there are new sports clubs in the area of new cairo ( one hour far from cairo's down town ) , these are al zohour sporting club , wadi degla sporting club and platinum club .
most of the sports federations of the country are also located in the city suburbs , including the egyptian football association .
the headquarters of the confederation of african football ( caf ) was previously located in cairo , before relocating to its new headquarters in *num* october city , a small city away from cairo's crowded districts .
in october *num* , the egyptian rugby federation was officially formed and granted membership into the international rugby board .

president mubarak inaugurated the new cairo opera house of the egyptian national cultural centres on *num* october *num* , *num* years after the royal opera house had been destroyed by fire .
the national cultural centre was built with the help of jica , the japan international co-operation agency and stands as a prominent feature for the japanese-egyptian co-operation and the friendship between the two nations .
the khedivial opera house , or royal opera house , was the original opera house in cairo .
it was dedicated on *num* november *num* and burned down on *num* october *num* .
after the original opera house was destroyed , cairo was without an opera house for nearly two decades until the opening of the new cairo opera house in *num* .
cairo held its first international film festival *num* august *num* , when the first cairo international film festival was launched by the egyptian association of film writers and critics , headed by kamal el-mallakh .

the majority of the nation's commerce is generated there , or passes through the city .
the great majority of publishing houses and media outlets and nearly all film studios are there , as are half of the nation's hospital beds and universities .
this has fueled rapid construction in the city—one building in five is less than *num* years old .
this growth until recently surged well ahead of city services .
homes , roads , electricity , telephone and sewer services were all in short supply .
analysts trying to grasp the magnitude of the change coined terms like " hyper-urbanization " .
tahrir square was founded during the mid *ord* century with the establishment of modern downtown cairo .
it was first named ismailia square , after the 19th-century ruler khedive ismail , who commissioned the new downtown district's ' paris on the nile ' design .

at , it is higher than the great pyramid of giza , which stands some to the southwest .
this area of cairo is so-named as it contains the remains of the ancient roman fortress of babylon and also overlaps the original site of fustat , the first arab settlement in egypt ( *ord* century ad ) and the predecessor of later cairo .
the area includes the coptic cairo , which holds a high concentration of old christian churches such as the hanging church , the greek orthodox church of st .
george , and other christian or coptic buildings , most of which are located over the site of the ancient roman fortress .
it is also the location of the coptic museum , which showcases the history of coptic art from greco-roman to islamic times , and of the ben ezra synagogue , the oldest and best-known synagogue in cairo , where the important collection of geniza documents were discovered in the *ord* century .
to the north of this coptic enclave is the amr ibn al-'as mosque , the first mosque in egypt and the most important religious center of what was formerly fustat , founded in *num* ad right after the arab conquest but rebuilt many times since .
cairo holds one of the greatest concentrations of historical monuments of islamic architecture in the world .
the areas around the old walled city and around the citadel are characterized by hundreds of mosques , tombs , madrasas , mansions , caravanserais , and fortifications dating from the islamic era and are often referred to as " islamic cairo " , especially in english travel literature .
it is also the location of several important religious shrines such as the al-hussein mosque ( whose shrine is believed to hold the head of husayn ibn ali ) , the mausoleum of imam al-shafi'i ( founder of the shafi'i madhhab , one of the primary schools of thought in sunni islamic jurisprudence ) , the tomb of sayyida ruqayya , the mosque of sayyida nafisa , and others .
the first mosque in egypt was the mosque of amr ibn al-as in what was formerly fustat , the first arab-muslim settlement in the area .
however , the mosque of ibn tulun is the oldest mosque that still retains its original form and is a rare example of abbasid architecture from the classical period of islamic civilization .
it was built in 876–879 ad in a style inspired by the abbasid capital of samarra in iraq .
it is one of the largest mosques in cairo and is often cited as one of the most beautiful .
another abbasid construction , the nilometer on rhoda island , is the oldest original structure in cairo , built in *num* ad .
it was designed to measure the level of the nile , which was important for agricultural and administrative purposes .
the settlement that was formally named cairo ( arabic : " al-qahira " ) was founded to the northeast of fustat in *num* ad by the victorious fatimid army .
the fatimids built it as a separate palatial city which contained their palaces and institutions of government .
it was enclosed by a circuit of walls , which were rebuilt in stone in the late *ord* century ad by the vizir badr al-gamali , parts of which survive today at bab zuwayla in the south and bab al-futuh and bab al-nasr in the north .
one of the most important and lasting institutions founded in the fatimid period was the mosque of al-azhar , founded in *num* ad , which competes with the qarawiyyin in fes for the title of oldest university in the world .
today , al-azhar university is the foremost center of islamic learning in the world and one of egypt's largest universities with campuses across the country .
the mosque itself retains significant fatimid elements but has been added to and expanded in subsequent centuries , notably by the mamluk sultans qaitbay and al-ghuri and by abd al-rahman katkhuda in the *ord* century .
other extant monuments from the fatimid era include the large mosque of al-hakim , the al-aqmar mosque , juyushi mosque , lulua mosque , and the mosque of salih tala'i .
the most prominent architectural heritage of medieval cairo , however , dates from the mamluk period , from *num* to *num* ad .
the mamluk sultans and elites were eager patrons of religious and scholarly life , commonly building religious or funerary complexes whose functions could include a mosque , madrasa , khanqah ( for sufis ) , a sabil ( water dispensary ) , and a mausoleum for themselves and their families .
among the best-known examples of mamluk monuments in cairo are the huge mosque-madrasa of sultan hasan , the mosque of amir al-maridani , the mosque of sultan al-mu'ayyad ( whose twin minarets were built above the gate of bab zuwayla ) , the sultan al-ghuri complex , the funerary complex of sultan qaytbay in the northern cemetery , and the trio of monuments in the bayn al-qasrayn area comprising the complex of sultan al-mansur qalawun , the madrasa of al-nasir muhammad , and the madrasa of sultan barquq .
it is said that a lot of the columns found in mosques were taken from the coptic churches because of their beautiful artistic carvings and placed in mosques .
the mamluks , and the later ottomans , also built wikalas or caravanserais to house merchants and goods due to the important role of trade and commerce in cairo's economy .
the most famous example still intact today is the wikala al-ghuri , which nowadays also hosts regular performances by the al-tannoura egyptian heritage dance troupe .
the famous khan al-khalili ( see below ) is a commercial hub which also integrated caravanserais ( also known as khans ) .
the citadel is a fortified enclosure begun by salah al-din in *num* ad on an outcrop of the muqattam hills as part of a large defensive system to protect both cairo to the north and fustat to the southwest .
it was the center of egyptian government and residence of its rulers until *num* , when khedive isma'il moved to ' abdin palace .
it is still occupied by the military today , but is now open as a tourist attraction comprising , notably , the national military museum , the *ord* century mosque of al-nasir muhammad , and the *ord* century mosque of muhammad ali which commands a dominant position on cairo's skyline .
khan el-khalili is an ancient bazaar , or marketplace adjacent to the al-hussein mosque .
it dates back to *num* , when amir jarkas el-khalili built a large caravanserai , or khan .
( a caravanserai is a hotel for traders , and usually the focal point for any surrounding area .
) this original carvanserai building was demolished by sultan al-ghuri , who rebuilt it as a new commercial complex in the early *ord* century , forming the basis for the network of souqs existing today .
many medieval elements remain today , including the ornate mamluk-style gateways .
today , the khan el-khalili is a major tourist attraction and popular stop for tour groups .
cairo is an expanding city , which has led to many environmental problems .
the air pollution in cairo is a matter of serious concern .
greater cairo's volatile aromatic hydrocarbon levels are higher than many other similar cities .
air quality measurements in cairo have also been recording dangerous levels of lead , carbon dioxide , sulphur dioxide , and suspended particulate matter concentrations due to decades of unregulated vehicle emissions , urban industrial operations , and chaff and trash burning .
there are over *num* , *num* , *num* cars on the streets of cairo , *num* % of which are over *num* years old , and therefore lack modern emission cutting features like catalytic converters .
cairo has a very poor dispersion factor because of lack of rain and its layout of tall buildings and narrow streets , which create a bowl effect .
in recent years , a mysterious black cloud ( as egyptians refer to it ) appeared over cairo every autumn and causes serious respiratory diseases and eye irritations for the city's citizens .
tourists who are not familiar with such high levels of pollution must take extra care .
cairo also has many unregistered lead and copper smelters which heavily pollute the city .
the results of this has been a permanent haze over the city with particulate matter in the air reaching over three times normal levels .
it is estimated that *num* , *num* to *num* , *num* people a year in cairo die due to air pollution-related diseases .
lead has been shown to cause harm to the central nervous system and neurotoxicity particularly in children .
in *num* , the first environmental acts were introduced and the situation has seen some improvement with *num* air monitoring stations and emissions tests on cars .
twenty thousand buses have also been commissioned to the city to improve congestion levels , which are very high .
the city also suffers from a high level of land pollution .
cairo produces *num* , *num* tons of waste material each day , *num* , *num* tons of which is not collected or managed .
this once again is a huge health hazard and the egyptian government is looking for ways to combat this .
the cairo cleaning and beautification agency was founded to collect and recycle the waste ; however , they also work with the zabbaleen ( or zabaleen ) , a community that has been collecting and recycling cairo's waste since the turn of the *ord* century and live in an area known locally as manshiyat naser .
both are working together to pick up as much waste as possible within the city limits , though it remains a pressing problem .
the city also suffers from water pollution as the sewer system tends to fail and overflow .
on occasion , sewage has escaped onto the streets to create a health hazard .
this problem is hoped to be solved by a new sewer system funded by the european union , which could cope with the demand of the city .
the dangerously high levels of mercury in the city's water system has global health officials concerned over related health risks .
as previously mentioned , the arab league headquarters is located in cairo .
disease a disease is a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of part or all of an organism , and that is not due to any external injury .
diseases are often construed as medical conditions that are associated with specific symptoms and signs .
a disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions .
for example , internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases , including various forms of immunodeficiency , hypersensitivity , allergies and autoimmune disorders .
in humans , " disease " is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain , dysfunction , distress , social problems , or death to the person afflicted , or similar problems for those in contact with the person .
in this broader sense , it sometimes includes injuries , disabilities , disorders , syndromes , infections , isolated symptoms , deviant behaviors , and atypical variations of structure and function , while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories .
diseases can affect people not only physically , but also mentally , as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person's perspective on life .
death due to disease is called death by natural causes .
there are four main types of disease : infectious diseases , deficiency diseases , hereditary diseases ( including both genetic diseases and non-genetic hereditary diseases ) , and physiological diseases .
diseases can also be classified in other ways , such as communicable versus non-communicable diseases .
the deadliest diseases in humans are coronary artery disease ( blood flow obstruction ) , followed by cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory infections .
in developed countries , the diseases that cause the most sickness overall are neuropsychiatric conditions , such as depression and anxiety .
the study of disease is called " pathology " , which includes the study of " etiology " , or cause .
in many cases , terms such as " disease " , " disorder " , " morbidity " , " sickness " and " illness " are used interchangeably .
there are situations , however , when specific terms are considered preferable .
in an infectious disease , the incubation period is the time between infection and the appearance of symptoms .
the latency period is the time between infection and the ability of the disease to spread to another person , which may precede , follow , or be simultaneous with the appearance of symptoms .
some viruses also exhibit a dormant phase , called viral latency , in which the virus hides in the body in an inactive state .
for example , varicella zoster virus causes chickenpox in the acute phase ; after recovery from chickenpox , the virus may remain dormant in nerve cells for many years , and later cause herpes zoster ( shingles ) .
diseases may be classified by cause , pathogenesis ( mechanism by which the disease is caused ) , or by symptom ( s ) .
alternatively , diseases may be classified according to the organ system involved , though this is often complicated since many diseases affect more than one organ .
a chief difficulty in nosology is that diseases often cannot be defined and classified clearly , especially when cause or pathogenesis are unknown .
thus diagnostic terms often only reflect a symptom or set of symptoms ( syndrome ) .
classical classification of human disease derives from observational correlation between pathological analysis and clinical syndromes .
today it is preferred to classify them by their cause if it is known .
the most known and used classification of diseases is the world health organization's icd .
this is periodically updated .
currently the last publication is the icd-10 .
only some diseases such as influenza are contagious and commonly believed infectious .
the micro-organisms that cause these diseases are known as pathogens and include varieties of bacteria , viruses , protozoa and fungi .
infectious diseases can be transmitted , e .
g .
by hand-to-mouth contact with infectious material on surfaces , by bites of insects or other carriers of the disease , and from contaminated water or food ( often via fecal contamination ) , etc .
also , there are sexually transmitted diseases .
in some cases , microorganisms that are not readily spread from person to person play a role , while other diseases can be prevented or ameliorated with appropriate nutrition or other lifestyle changes .
some diseases , such as most ( but not all ) forms of cancer , heart disease , and mental disorders , are non-infectious diseases .
many non-infectious diseases have a partly or completely genetic basis ( see genetic disorder ) and may thus be transmitted from one generation to another .
social determinants of health are the social conditions in which people live that determine their health .
illnesses are generally related to social , economic , political , and environmental circumstances .
social determinants of health have been recognized by several health organizations such as the public health agency of canada and the world health organization to greatly influence collective and personal well-being .
the world health organization's social determinants council also recognizes social determinants of health in poverty .
when the cause of a disease is poorly understood , societies tend to mythologize the disease or use it as a metaphor or symbol of whatever that culture considers evil .
for example , until the bacterial cause of tuberculosis was discovered in *num* , experts variously ascribed the disease to heredity , a sedentary lifestyle , depressed mood , and overindulgence in sex , rich food , or alcohol—all the social ills of the time .
when a disease is caused by a pathogen ( e .
g .
, when the disease malaria is caused by infection by " plasmodium " parasites .
) , the term " disease " may be misleadingly used even in the scientific literature in place of its causal agent , the pathogen .
this language habit can cause confusion in the communication of the cause-effect principle in epidemiology , and as such it should be strongly discouraged .
many diseases and disorders can be prevented through a variety of means .
these include sanitation , proper nutrition , adequate exercise , vaccinations and other self-care and public health measures .
medical therapies or treatments are efforts to cure or improve a disease or other health problem .
in the medical field , therapy is synonymous with the word " treatment " .
among psychologists , the term may refer specifically to psychotherapy or " talk therapy " .
common treatments include medications , surgery , medical devices , and self-care .
treatments may be provided by an organized health care system , or informally , by the patient or family members .
preventive healthcare is a way to avoid an injury , sickness , or disease in the first place .
a treatment or cure is applied after a medical problem has already started .
a treatment attempts to improve or remove a problem , but treatments may not produce permanent cures , especially in chronic diseases .
cures are a subset of treatments that reverse diseases completely or end medical problems permanently .
many diseases that cannot be completely cured are still treatable .
pain management ( also called pain medicine ) is that branch of medicine employing an interdisciplinary approach to the relief of pain and improvement in the quality of life of those living with pain .
treatment for medical emergencies must be provided promptly , often through an emergency department or , in less critical situations , through an urgent care facility .
epidemiology is the study of the factors that cause or encourage diseases .
some diseases are more common in certain geographic areas , among people with certain genetic or socioeconomic characteristics , or at different times of the year .
epidemiology is considered a cornerstone methodology of public health research , and is highly regarded in evidence-based medicine for identifying risk factors for disease .
in the study of communicable and non-communicable diseases , the work of epidemiologists ranges from outbreak investigation to study design , data collection and analysis including the development of statistical models to test hypotheses and the documentation of results for submission to peer-reviewed journals .
epidemiologists also study the interaction of diseases in a population , a condition known as a syndemic .
epidemiologists rely on a number of other scientific disciplines such as biology ( to better understand disease processes ) , biostatistics ( the current raw information available ) , geographic information science ( to store data and map disease patterns ) and social science disciplines ( to better understand proximate and distal risk factors ) .
epidemiology can help identify causes as well as guide prevention efforts .
in studying diseases , epidemiology faces the challenge of defining them .
especially for poorly understood diseases , different groups might use significantly different definitions .
without an agreed-on definition , different researchers may report different numbers of cases and characteristics of the disease .
some morbidity databases are compiled with data supplied by states and territories health authorities , at national levels or larger scale ( such as european hospital morbidity database ( hmdb ) ) which may contain hospital discharge data by detailed diagnosis , age and sex .
the european hmdb datea was submitted by european countries to the world health organization regional office for europe .
disease burden is the impact of a health problem in an area measured by financial cost , mortality , morbidity , or other indicators .
there are several measures used to quantify the burden imposed by diseases on people .
the years of potential life lost ( ypll ) is a simple estimate of the number of years that a person's life was shortened due to a disease .
for example , if a person dies at the age of *num* from a disease , and would probably have lived until age *num* without that disease , then that disease has caused a loss of *num* years of potential life .
ypll measurements do not account for how disabled a person is before dying , so the measurement treats a person who dies suddenly and a person who died at the same age after decades of illness as equivalent .
in *num* , the world health organization calculated that *num* million years of potential life were lost to premature death .
the quality-adjusted life year ( qaly ) and disability-adjusted life year ( daly ) metrics are similar , but take into account whether the person was healthy after diagnosis .
in addition to the number of years lost due to premature death , these measurements add part of the years lost to being sick .
unlike ypll , these measurements show the burden imposed on people who are very sick , but who live a normal lifespan .
a disease that has high morbidity , but low mortality , has a high daly and a low ypll .
in *num* , the world health organization calculated that *num* .
*num* billion disability-adjusted life years were lost to disease and injury .
in the developed world , heart disease and stroke cause the most loss of life , but neuropsychiatric conditions like major depressive disorder cause the most years lost to being sick .
how a society responds to diseases is the subject of medical sociology .
a condition may be considered a disease in some cultures or eras but not in others .
for example , obesity can represent wealth and abundance , and is a status symbol in famine-prone areas and some places hard-hit by hiv / aids .
epilepsy is considered a sign of spiritual gifts among the hmong people .
sickness confers the social legitimization of certain benefits , such as illness benefits , work avoidance , and being looked after by others .
the person who is sick takes on a social role called the sick role .
a person who responds to a dreaded disease , such as cancer , in a culturally acceptable fashion may be publicly and privately honored with higher social status .
in return for these benefits , the sick person is obligated to seek treatment and work to become well once more .
as a comparison , consider pregnancy , which is not interpreted as a disease or sickness , even if the mother and baby may both benefit from medical care .
most religions grant exceptions from religious duties to people who are sick .
for example , one whose life would be endangered by fasting on yom kippur or during ramadan is exempted from the requirement , or even forbidden from participating .
people who are sick are also exempted from social duties .
for example , ill health is the only socially acceptable reason for an american to refuse an invitation to the white house .
the identification of a condition as a disease , rather than as simply a variation of human structure or function , can have significant social or economic implications .
the controversial recognitions as diseases of repetitive stress injury ( rsi ) and post-traumatic stress disorder ( also known as " soldier's heart " , " shell shock " , and " combat fatigue " ) has had a number of positive and negative effects on the financial and other responsibilities of governments , corporations and institutions towards individuals , as well as on the individuals themselves .
the social implication of viewing aging as a disease could be profound , though this classification is not yet widespread .
lepers were people who were historically shunned because they had an infectious disease , and the term " leper " still evokes social stigma .
fear of disease can still be a widespread social phenomenon , though not all diseases evoke extreme social stigma .
social standing and economic status affect health .
diseases of poverty are diseases that are associated with poverty and low social status ; diseases of affluence are diseases that are associated with high social and economic status .
which diseases are associated with which states varies according to time , place , and technology .
some diseases , such as diabetes mellitus , may be associated with both poverty ( poor food choices ) and affluence ( long lifespans and sedentary lifestyles ) , through different mechanisms .
the term lifestyle diseases describes diseases associated with longevity and that are more common among older people .
for example , cancer is far more common in societies in which most members live until they reach the age of *num* than in societies in which most members die before they reach the age of *num* .
an illness narrative is a way of organizing a medical experience into a coherent story that illustrates the sick individual's personal experience .
people use metaphors to make sense of their experiences with disease .
the metaphors move disease from an objective thing that exists to an affective experience .
the most popular metaphors draw on military concepts : disease is an enemy that must be feared , fought , battled , and routed .
the patient or the healthcare provider is a warrior , rather than a passive victim or bystander .
the agents of communicable diseases are invaders ; non-communicable diseases constitute internal insurrection or civil war .
because the threat is urgent , perhaps a matter of life and death , unthinkably radical , even oppressive , measures are society's and the patient's moral duty as they courageously mobilize to struggle against destruction .
the war on cancer is an example of this metaphorical use of language .
this language is empowering to some patients , but leaves others feeling like they are failures .
another class of metaphors describes the experience of illness as a journey : the person travels to or from a place of disease , and changes himself , discovers new information , or increases his experience along the way .
he may travel " on the road to recovery " or make changes to " get on the right track " or choose " pathways " .
some are explicitly immigration-themed : the patient has been exiled from the home territory of health to the land of the ill , changing identity and relationships in the process .
this language is more common among british healthcare professionals than the language of physical aggression .
some metaphors are disease-specific .
slavery is a common metaphor for addictions : the alcoholic is enslaved by drink , and the smoker is captive to nicotine .
some cancer patients treat the loss of their hair from chemotherapy as a metonymy or metaphor for all the losses caused by the disease .
some diseases are used as metaphors for social ills : " cancer " is a common description for anything that is endemic and destructive in society , such as poverty , injustice , or racism .
aids was seen as a divine judgment for moral decadence , and only by purging itself from the " pollution " of the " invader " could society become healthy again .
more recently , when aids seemed less threatening , this type of emotive language was applied to avian flu and type *num* diabetes mellitus .
authors in the *ord* century commonly used tuberculosis as a symbol and a metaphor for transcendence .
victims of the disease were portrayed in literature as having risen above daily life to become ephemeral objects of spiritual or artistic achievement .
in the *ord* century , after its cause was better understood , the same disease became the emblem of poverty , squalor , and other social problems .
arno the arno is a river in the tuscany region of italy .
it is the most important river of central italy after the tiber .
the river originates on mount falterona in the casentino area of the apennines , and initially takes a southward curve .
the river turns to the west near arezzo passing through florence , empoli and pisa , flowing into the tyrrhenian sea at marina di pisa .
with a length of , it is the largest river in the region .
it has many tributaries : sieve at long , bisenzio at , and the era , elsa , pesa , and pescia .
the drainage basin amounts to more than and drains the waters of the following subbasins : it crosses florence , where it passes below the ponte vecchio and the santa trinita bridge ( built by bartolomeo ammanati but inspired by michelangelo ) .
the river flooded this city regularly in historical times , most recently in *num* , with after rainfall of in badia agnano and in florence , in only *num* hours .
before pisa , the arno is crossed by the imperial canal at la botte .
this water channel passes under the arno through a tunnel , and serves to drain the former area of the lago di bientina , which was once the largest lake in tuscany before its reclamation .
the flow rate of the arno is irregular .
it is sometimes described as having a torrentlike behaviour , because it can easily go from almost dry to near flood in a few days .
at the point where the arno leaves the apennines , flow measurements can vary between .
new dams built upstream of florence have greatly alleviated the problem in recent years .
the flood on november *num* , *num* collapsed the embankment in florence , killing at least *num* people and damaging or destroying millions of works of art and rare books .
new conservation techniques were inspired by the disaster , but even decades later hundreds of works still await restoration .
from latin " arnus " ( pliny , " natural history " *num* .
*num* ) .
the philologist hans krahe related this toponym on a paleo-european basis " *ar-n- " , derived from the proto-indo-european root *"er- " , " flow , move " .
antimony antimony is a chemical element with symbol sb ( from ) and atomic number *num* .
a lustrous gray metalloid , it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite ( sbs ) .
antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics , often known by the arabic name , kohl .
metallic antimony was also known , but it was erroneously identified as lead upon its discovery .
the earliest known description of the metal in the west was written in *num* by vannoccio biringuccio .
for some time , china has been the largest producer of antimony and its compounds , with most production coming from the xikuangshan mine in hunan .
the industrial methods for refining antimony are roasting and reduction with carbon or direct reduction of stibnite with iron .
the largest applications for metallic antimony is an alloy with lead and tin and the lead antimony plates in lead–acid batteries .
alloys of lead and tin with antimony have improved properties for solders , bullets , and plain bearings .
antimony compounds are prominent additives for chlorine and bromine-containing fire retardants found in many commercial and domestic products .
an emerging application is the use of antimony in microelectronics .
antimony is a member of group *num* of the periodic table , one of the elements called pnictogens , and has an electronegativity of *num* .
*num* .
in accordance with periodic trends , it is more electronegative than tin or bismuth , and less electronegative than tellurium or arsenic .
antimony is stable in air at room temperature , but reacts with oxygen if heated to produce antimony trioxide , sbo .
antimony is a silvery , lustrous gray metalloid with a mohs scale hardness of *num* , which is too soft to make hard objects ; coins of antimony were issued in china's guizhou province in *num* but the durability was poor and the minting was soon discontinued .
antimony is resistant to attack by acids .
four allotropes of antimony are known : a stable metallic form and three metastable forms ( explosive , black and yellow ) .
elemental antimony is a brittle , silver-white shiny metalloid .
when slowly cooled , molten antimony crystallizes in a trigonal cell , isomorphic with the gray allotrope of arsenic .
a rare explosive form of antimony can be formed from the electrolysis of antimony trichloride .
when scratched with a sharp implement , an exothermic reaction occurs and white fumes are given off as metallic antimony forms ; when rubbed with a pestle in a mortar , a strong detonation occurs .
black antimony is formed upon rapid cooling of antimony vapor .
it has the same crystal structure as red phosphorus and black arsenic , it oxidizes in air and may ignite spontaneously .
at *num* °c , it gradually transforms into the stable form .
the yellow allotrope of antimony is the most unstable .
it has only been generated by oxidation of stibine ( sbh ) at −90 °c .
above this temperature and in ambient light , this metastable allotrope transforms into the more stable black allotrope .
elemental antimony adopts a layered structure ( space group rm no .
*num* ) in which layers consist of fused , ruffled , six-membered rings .
the nearest and next-nearest neighbors form an irregular octahedral complex , with the three atoms in each double layer slightly closer than the three atoms in the next .
this relatively close packing leads to a high density of *num* .
*num* g / cm , but the weak bonding between the layers leads to the low hardness and brittleness of antimony .
antimony has two stable isotopes : sb with a natural abundance of *num* .
*num* % and sb with a natural abundance of *num* .
*num* % .
it also has *num* radioisotopes , of which the longest-lived is sb with a half-life of *num* .
*num* years .
in addition , *num* metastable states have been characterized .
the most stable of these is sb with a half-life of *num* .
*num* days .
isotopes that are lighter than the stable sb tend to decay by β decay , and those that are heavier tend to decay by β decay , with some exceptions .
the abundance of antimony in the earth's crust is estimated to be *num* .
*num* to *num* .
*num* parts per million , comparable to thallium at *num* .
*num* parts per million and silver at *num* .
*num* ppm .
even though this element is not abundant , it is found in more than *num* mineral species .
antimony is sometimes found natively ( e .
g .
on antimony peak ) , but more frequently it is found in the sulfide stibnite ( sbs ) which is the predominant ore mineral .
antimony compounds are often classified according to their oxidation state : sb ( iii ) and sb ( v ) .
the +5 oxidation state is more stable .
antimony trioxide is formed when antimony is burnt in air .
in the gas phase , the molecule of the compound is , but it polymerizes upon condensing .
antimony pentoxide ( ) can be formed only by oxidation with concentrated nitric acid .
antimony also forms a mixed-valence oxide , antimony tetroxide ( ) , which features both sb ( iii ) and sb ( v ) .
unlike oxides of phosphorus and arsenic , these oxides are amphoteric , do not form well-defined oxoacids , and react with acids to form antimony salts .
antimonous acid is unknown , but the conjugate base sodium antimonite ( ) forms upon fusing sodium oxide and .
transition metal antimonites are also known .
antimonic acid exists only as the hydrate , forming salts as the antimonate anion .
when a solution containing this anion is dehydrated , the precipitate contains mixed oxides .
many antimony ores are sulfides , including stibnite ( ) , pyrargyrite ( ) , zinkenite , jamesonite , and boulangerite .
antimony pentasulfide is non-stoichiometric and features antimony in the +3 oxidation state and s-s bonds .
several thioantimonides are known , such as and .
antimony forms two series of halides : and .
the trihalides , , , and are all molecular compounds having trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry .
the trifluoride is prepared by the reaction of with hf : it is lewis acidic and readily accepts fluoride ions to form the complex anions and .
molten is a weak electrical conductor .
the trichloride is prepared by dissolving in hydrochloric acid : the pentahalides and have trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry in the gas phase , but in the liquid phase , is polymeric , whereas is monomeric .
is a powerful lewis acid used to make the superacid fluoroantimonic acid ( " hsbf " ) .
oxyhalides are more common for antimony than for arsenic and phosphorus .
antimony trioxide dissolves in concentrated acid to form oxoantimonyl compounds such as sbocl and .
compounds in this class generally are described as derivatives of sb .
antimony forms antimonides with metals , such as indium antimonide ( insb ) and silver antimonide ( ) .
the alkali metal and zinc antimonides , such as nasb and znsb , are more reactive .
treating these antimonides with acid produces the highly unstable gas stibine , : stibine can also be produced by treating salts with hydride reagents such as sodium borohydride .
stibine decomposes spontaneously at room temperature .
because stibine has a positive heat of formation , it is thermodynamically unstable and thus antimony does not react with hydrogen directly .
organoantimony compounds are typically prepared by alkylation of antimony halides with grignard reagents .
a large variety of compounds are known with both sb ( iii ) and sb ( v ) centers , including mixed chloro-organic derivatives , anions , and cations .
examples include sb ( ch ) ( triphenylstibine ) , sb ( ch ) ( with an sb-sb bond ) , and cyclic [ sb ( ch ) ] .
pentacoordinated organoantimony compounds are common , examples being sb ( ch ) and several related halides .
antimony ( iii ) sulfide , sbs , was recognized in predynastic egypt as an eye cosmetic ( kohl ) as early as about *num* bc , when the cosmetic palette was invented .
an artifact , said to be part of a vase , made of antimony dating to about *num* bc was found at telloh , chaldea ( part of present-day iraq ) , and a copper object plated with antimony dating between *num* bc and *num* bc has been found in egypt .
austen , at a lecture by herbert gladstone in *num* commented that " we only know of antimony at the present day as a highly brittle and crystalline metal , which could hardly be fashioned into a useful vase , and therefore this remarkable ' find ' ( artifact mentioned above ) must represent the lost art of rendering antimony malleable .
" moorey was unconvinced the artifact was indeed a vase , mentioning that selimkhanov , after his analysis of the tello object ( published in *num* ) , " attempted to relate the metal to transcaucasian natural antimony " ( i .
e .
native metal ) and that " the antimony objects from transcaucasia are all small personal ornaments .
" this weakens the evidence for a lost art " of rendering antimony malleable .
" the roman scholar pliny the elder described several ways of preparing antimony sulfide for medical purposes in his treatise " natural history " .
pliny the elder also made a distinction between " male " and " female " forms of antimony ; the male form is probably the sulfide , while the female form , which is superior , heavier , and less friable , has been suspected to be native metallic antimony .
the greek naturalist pedanius dioscorides mentioned that antimony sulfide could be roasted by heating by a current of air .
it is thought that this produced metallic antimony .
the first description of a procedure for isolating antimony is in the *num* book " de la pirotechnia " by vannoccio biringuccio , predating the more famous *num* book by agricola , " de re metallica " .
in this context agricola has been often incorrectly credited with the discovery of metallic antimony .
the book " currus triumphalis antimonii " ( the triumphal chariot of antimony ) , describing the preparation of metallic antimony , was published in germany in *num* .
it was purported to be written by a benedictine monk , writing under the name basilius valentinus in the *ord* century ; if it were authentic , which it is not , it would predate biringuccio .
the metal antimony was known to german chemist andreas libavius in *num* who obtained it by adding iron to a molten mixture of antimony sulfide , salt and potassium tartrate .
this procedure produced antimony with a crystalline or starred surface .
with the advent of challenges to phlogiston theory , it was recognized that antimony is an element forming sulfides , oxides , and other compounds , as do other metals .
the first discovery of naturally occurring pure antimony in the earth's crust was described by the swedish scientist and local mine district engineer anton von swab in *num* ; the type-sample was collected from the sala silver mine in the bergslagen mining district of sala , västmanland , sweden .
the medieval latin form , from which the modern languages and late byzantine greek take their names for antimony , is " antimonium " .
the origin of this is uncertain ; all suggestions have some difficulty either of form or interpretation .
the popular etymology , from ἀντίμοναχός " anti-monachos " or french " antimoine " , still has adherents ; this would mean " monk-killer " , and is explained by many early alchemists being monks , and antimony being poisonous .
another popular etymology is the hypothetical greek word ἀντίμόνος " antimonos " , " against aloneness " , explained as " not found as metal " , or " not found unalloyed " .
lippmann conjectured a hypothetical greek word ανθήμόνιον " anthemonion " , which would mean " floret " , and cites several examples of related greek words ( but not that one ) which describe chemical or biological efflorescence .
the early uses of " antimonium " include the translations , in 1050–1100 , by constantine the african of arabic medical treatises .
several authorities believe " antimonium " is a scribal corruption of some arabic form ; meyerhof derives it from " ithmid " ; other possibilities include " athimar " , the arabic name of the metalloid , and a hypothetical " as-stimmi " , derived from or parallel to the greek .
the standard chemical symbol for antimony ( sb ) is credited to jöns jakob berzelius , who derived the abbreviation from " stibium " .
the ancient words for antimony mostly have , as their chief meaning , kohl , the sulfide of antimony .
the egyptians called antimony " mśdmt " ; in hieroglyphs , the vowels are uncertain , but the coptic form of the word is ⲥⲧⲏⲙ ( stēm ) .
the greek word , στίμμι " stimmi " , is probably a loan word from arabic or from egyptian " stm " o34 : d46-g17-f21 : d4 and is used by attic tragic poets of the *ord* century bc .
later greeks also used στἰβι " stibi " , as did celsus and pliny , writing in latin , in the first century ad .
pliny also gives the names " stimi " , " larbaris " , alabaster , and the " very common " " platyophthalmos " , " wide-eye " ( from the effect of the cosmetic ) .
later latin authors adapted the word to latin as " stibium " .
the arabic word for the substance , as opposed to the cosmetic , can appear as إثمد " ithmid , athmoud , othmod " , or " uthmod " .
littré suggests the first form , which is the earliest , derives from " stimmida " , an accusative for " stimmi " .
the british geological survey ( bgs ) reported that in *num* china was the top producer of antimony with approximately *num* % of the world share , followed at a distance by south africa , bolivia and tajikistan .
xikuangshan mine in hunan province has the largest deposits in china with an estimated deposit of *num* .
*num* million metric tons .
in *num* , according to the us geological survey , china accounted for *num* .
*num* % of total antimony production , followed in second place by russia with *num* .
*num* % and tajikistan with *num* .
*num* % .
chinese production of antimony is expected to decline in the future as mines and smelters are closed down by the government as part of pollution control .
especially due to a new environmental protection law having gone into effect on january *num* and revised “emission standards of pollutants for stanum , antimony , and mercury” having gone into effect , hurdles for economic production are higher .
according to the national bureau of statistics in china , by september *num* *num* % of antimony production capacity in the hunan province ( the province with biggest antimony reserves in china ) had not been used .
reported production of antimony in china has fallen and is unlikely to increase in the coming years , according to the roskill report .
no significant antimony deposits in china have been developed for about ten years , and the remaining economic reserves are being rapidly depleted .
the world's largest antimony producers , according to roskill , are listed below : according to statistics from the usgs , current global reserves of antimony will be depleted in *num* years .
however , the usgs expects more resources will be found .
the extraction of antimony from ores depends on the quality and composition of the ore .
most antimony is mined as the sulfide ; lower-grade ores are concentrated by froth flotation , while higher-grade ores are heated to 500–600 °c , the temperature at which stibnite melts and separates from the gangue minerals .
antimony can be isolated from the crude antimony sulfide by reduction with scrap iron : the sulfide is converted to an oxide ; the product is then roasted , sometimes for the purpose of vaporizing the volatile antimony ( iii ) oxide , which is recovered .
this material is often used directly for the main applications , impurities being arsenic and sulfide .
antimony is isolated from the oxide by a carbothermal reduction : the lower-grade ores are reduced in blast furnaces while the higher-grade ores are reduced in reverberatory furnaces .
antimony has consistently been ranked high in european and us risk lists concerning criticality of the element indicating the relative risk to the supply of chemical elements or element groups required to maintain the current economy and lifestyle .
with most of the antimony imported into europe and the us coming from china , chinese production is critical to supply .
as china is revising and increasing environmental control standards , antimony production is becoming increasingly restricted .
additionally chinese export quotas for antimony have been decreasing in the past years .
these two factors increase supply risk for both europe and us .
according to the bgs risk list *num* , antimony is ranked second highest ( after rare earth elements ) on the relative supply risk index .
this indicates that it has currently the second highest supply risk for chemical elements or element groups which are of economic value to the british economy and lifestyle .
furthermore , antimony was identified as one of *num* critical raw materials for the eu in a report published in *num* ( which revised the initial report published in *num* ) .
as seen in figure xxx antimony maintains high supply risk relative to its economic importance .
*num* % of the antimony is imported from china , which is a significantly high concentration of production .
much analysis has been conducted in the u .
s .
toward defining which metals should be called strategic or critical to the nation's security .
exact definitions do not exist , and views as to what constitutes a strategic or critical mineral to u .
s .
security diverge .
in *num* , no antimony was mined in the u .
s .
the metal is imported from foreign countries .
from 2011-2014 *num* % of america's antimony came from china , *num* % from india , *num* % from mexico , and *num* % from other sources .
there are no publicly known government stockpiles in place currently .
the u .
s .
“subcommittee on critical and strategic mineral supply chains” has screened *num* mineral resources from 1996-2008 .
it found that a small subset of minerals including antimony has fallen into the category of potentially critical minerals consistently .
in the future , a second assessment will be made of the found subset of minerals to identify which should be defined of significant risk and critical to u .
s .
interests .
about *num* % of antimony is consumed in flame retardants , and *num* % is used in alloys for batteries , plain bearings , and solders .
antimony is mainly used as the trioxide for flame-proofing compounds , always in combination with halogenated flame retardants except in halogen-containing polymers .
the flame retarding effect of antimony trioxide is produced by the formation of halogenated antimony compounds , which react with hydrogen atoms , and probably also with oxygen atoms and oh radicals , thus inhibiting fire .
markets for these flame-retardants include children's clothing , toys , aircraft , and automobile seat covers .
they are also added to polyester resins in fiberglass composites for such items as light aircraft engine covers .
the resin will burn in the presence of an externally generated flame , but will extinguish when the external flame is removed .
antimony forms a highly useful alloy with lead , increasing its hardness and mechanical strength .
for most applications involving lead , varying amounts of antimony are used as alloying metal .
in lead–acid batteries , this addition improves plate strength and charging characteristics .
it is used in antifriction alloys ( such as babbitt metal ) , in bullets and lead shot , electrical cable sheathing , type metal ( for example , for linotype printing machines ) , solder ( some " lead-free " solders contain *num* % sb ) , in pewter , and in hardening alloys with low tin content in the manufacturing of organ pipes .
three other applications consume nearly all the rest of the world's supply .
one application is as a stabilizer and catalyst for the production of polyethylene terephthalate .
another is as a fining agent to remove microscopic bubbles in glass , mostly for tv screens ; antimony ions interact with oxygen , suppressing the tendency of the latter to form bubbles .
the third application is pigments .
antimony is increasingly being used in semiconductors as a dopant in n-type silicon wafers for diodes , infrared detectors , and hall-effect devices .
in the 1950s , the emitters and collectors of n-p-n alloy junction transistors were doped with tiny beads of a lead-antimony alloy .
indium antimonide is used as a material for mid-infrared detectors .
biology and medicine have few uses for antimony .
treatments containing antimony , known as antimonials , are used as emetics .
antimony compounds are used as antiprotozoan drugs .
potassium antimonyl tartrate , or tartar emetic , was once used as an anti-schistosomal drug from *num* on .
it was subsequently replaced by praziquantel .
antimony and its compounds are used in several veterinary preparations , such as anthiomaline and lithium antimony thiomalate , as a skin conditioner in ruminants .
antimony has a nourishing or conditioning effect on keratinized tissues in animals .
antimony-based drugs , such as meglumine antimoniate , are also considered the drugs of choice for treatment of leishmaniasis in domestic animals .
unfortunately , besides having low therapeutic indices , the drugs have minimal penetration of the bone marrow , where some of the " leishmania " amastigotes reside , and curing the disease – especially the visceral form – is very difficult .
elemental antimony as an antimony pill was once used as a medicine .
it could be reused by others after ingestion and elimination .
antimony ( iii ) sulfide is used in the heads of some safety matches .
antimony sulfides help to stabilize the friction coefficient in automotive brake pad materials .
antimony is used in bullets , bullet tracers , paint , glass art , and as an opacifier in enamel .
antimony-124 is used together with beryllium in neutron sources ; the gamma rays emitted by antimony-124 initiate the photodisintegration of beryllium .
the emitted neutrons have an average energy of *num* kev .
natural antimony is used in startup neutron sources .
the effects of antimony and its compounds on human and environmental health differ widely .
elemental antimony metal does not affect human and environmental health .
inhalation of antimony trioxide ( and similar poorly soluble sb ( iii ) dust particles such as antimony dust ) is considered harmful and suspected of causing cancer .
however , these effects are only observed with female rats and after long-term exposure to high dust concentrations .
the effects are hypothesized to be attributed to inhalation of poorly soluble sb particles leading to impaired lung clearance , lung overload , inflammation and ultimately tumour formation , not to exposure to antimony ions ( oecd , *num* ) .
antimony chlorides are corrosive to skin .
the effects of antimony are not comparable to those of arsenic ; this might be caused by the significant differences of uptake , metabolism , and excretion between arsenic and antimony .
for oral absorption , icrp ( *num* ) has recommended values of *num* % for tartar emetic and *num* % for all other antimony compounds .
dermal absorption for metals is estimated to be at most *num* % ( herag , *num* ) .
inhalation absorption of antimony trioxide and other poorly soluble sb ( iii ) substances ( such as antimony dust ) is estimated at *num* .
*num* % ( oecd , *num* ) , whereas a value % is derived for sb ( v ) substances .
antimony ( v ) is not quantitatively reduced to antimony ( iii ) in the cell , and both species exist simultaneously .
antimony is mainly excreted from the human body via urine .
antimony and its compounds do not cause acute human health effects , with the exception of antimony potassium tartrate ( " tartar emetic " ) , a prodrug that is intentionally used to treat leishmaniasis patients .
prolonged skin contact with antimony dust may cause dermatitis .
however , it was agreed at the european union level that the skin rashes observed are not substance-specific , but most probably due to a physical blocking of sweat ducts ( echa / pr / *num* / *num* , helsinki , *num* july *num* ) .
antimony dust may also be explosive when dispersed in the air ; when in a bulk solid it is not combustible .
antimony is incompatible with strong acids , halogenated acids , and oxidizers ; when exposed to newly formed hydrogen it may form stibine ( sbh ) .
the 8-hour time-weighted average ( twa ) is set at *num* .
*num* mg / m by the american conference of governmental industrial hygienists and by the occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) as a legal permissible exposure limit ( pel ) in the workplace .
the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) has set a recommended exposure limit ( rel ) of *num* .
*num* mg / m as an *num* hour twa .
antimony compounds are used as catalysts for polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ) production .
some studies report minor antimony leaching from pet bottles into liquids , but levels are below drinking water guidelines .
antimony concentrations in fruit juice concentrates were somewhat higher ( up to *num* .
*num* µg / l of antimony ) , but juices do not fall under the drinking water regulations .
the drinking water guidelines are : the tdi proposed by who is *num* µg antimony per kilogram of body weight .
the idlh ( immediately dangerous to life and health ) value for antimony is *num* mg / m .
certain compounds of antimony appear to be toxic , particularly antimony trioxide and antimony potassium tartrate .
effects may be similar to arsenic poisoning .
occupational exposure may cause respiratory irritation , pneumoconiosis , antimony spots on the skin , gastrointestinal symptoms , and cardiac arrhythmias .
in addition , antimony trioxide is potentially carcinogenic to humans .
adverse health effects have been observed in humans and animals following inhalation , oral , or dermal exposure to antimony and antimony compounds .
antimony toxicity typically occurs either due to occupational exposure , during therapy or from accidental ingestion .
it is unclear if antimony can enter the body through the skin .
aberfoyle , stirling aberfoyle ( ) is a village in the historic county and registration county of perthshire and the council area of stirling , scotland .
the settlement lies northwest of glasgow .
the parish of aberfoyle takes its name from this village , and had a population of *num* , *num* at the *num* census .
the town is situated on the river forth at the foot of craigmore ( *num* metres high ) .
since *num* , when the duke of montrose constructed a road over the eastern shoulder of craigmore to join the older road at the entrance of the trossachs pass , aberfoyle has become the alternative route to the trossachs and loch katrine ; this road , known as the duke's road or duke's pass , was opened to the public in *num* when the forestry commission acquired the land .
loch ard , about west of aberfoyle , lies *num* metres above the sea .
it is long ( including the narrows at the east end ) and one mile ( *num* km ) broad .
towards the west end is eilean gorm ( " the green isle " ) , and near the north-western shore are the falls of ledard .
the loch's northern shores are dominated by the mountain ridge of beinn an fhogharaidh ( *num* m ) .
two miles northwest of loch ard is loch chon , at 90m above the sea , long , and about half a mile broad .
it drains by the avon dhu to loch ard , which is drained in turn by the forth .
aberfoyle supposedly originates from the brittonic celtic , " aber poll " or " aber phuill " ( scottish gaelic , ) , meaning ( place at the ) mouth of the phuill burn ( the pow burn enters the river forth at aberfoyle ) .
historically , alternative spellings such as " abirfull " , " aberfule " , " aberfoill " and " aberfoil " have been recorded before the current spelling became accepted by the *ord* century .
the slate quarries on craigmore which operated from the 1820s to the 1950s are now defunct ; at its peak this was a major industry .
other industries included an ironworks , established in the 1720s , as well as wool spinning and a lint mill .
from *num* the village was served by aberfoyle railway station , the terminus of the strathendrick and aberfoyle railway which connected to glasgow via dumbarton or kirkintilloch .
the station closed to passenger traffic in *num* , and the remaining freight services ceased in *num* .
the above industries have since died out , and aberfoyle is supported mainly by the forestry , industry and tourism .
visitors were first attracted to aberfoyle and the surrounding area after the publication of " the lady of the lake " by sir walter scott in *num* .
the poem described the beauty of loch katrine .
aberfoyle describes itself as " the gateway to the trossachs " , and is well situated for visitors to access attractions such as loch lomond and inchmahome priory at the lake of menteith .
a tourist information office run by visitscotland sits in the centre of town , offering free information , selling souvenirs and acting as a booking office for many of the local b&b's and hotels .
aberfoyle golf club was built in *num* and is located just south of town near the rob roy restaurant .
aberfoyle is also part of the loch lomond and the trossachs national park .
aberfoyle is also home to the largest go ape adventure course in the uk , featuring the longest death slide , or ' zip-line ' , in the uk .
aberfoyle has connections to many historical figures such as rob roy and mary , queen of scots .
robert roy macgregor was born at the head of nearby loch katrine , and his well-known cattle stealing exploits took him all around the area surrounding aberfoyle .
it is recorded , for example , that in *num* , the macgregors raided every barn in the village of kippen and stole all the villagers ' livestock ! there currently stands a tree in the village that macgregor was reputed to have climbed and hid in to escape the clutches of the law .
also , mary , queen of scots , visited nearby inchmahome priory often as a child , and during her short reign .
she also used the priory during her short reign , particularly in *num* , where she felt safe from the english army .
however , the most local historical figure is the reverend robert kirk , born in *num* .
it was the rev .
kirk who provided the first translation into gaidhlig of the book of psalms , however , he is better remembered for the publication of his book " "the secret commonwealth of elves , fauns , and fairies" " in *num* .
kirk had long been researching fairies , and the book collected several personal accounts and stories of folk who claimed to have encountered them .
it was after this , while kirk was minister of aberfoyle parish , that he died in unusual circumstances .
kirk had long believed that the local doon hill was the gateway to the " secret commonwealth " , or the land of the fairies .
it was a place that kirk visited often , taking daily walks there from his manse .
the story goes that the fairies of doon hill were angry with the rev .
kirk for going into the domain of the unseelie court , where he had been warned not to go , and decided to imprison him in doon hill — for one night in may *num* , the rev .
kirk went out for a walk to the hill , in his nightshirt .
some accounts claim that he simply vanished , however he suddenly collapsed .
he was found and brought home , but died soon afterwards .
he was buried in his own kirkyard , although local legends claim that the fairies took his body away , and the coffin contains only stones .
the huge pine tree that still stands at the top of doon hill is said to contain kirk's imprisoned spirit .
kirk's cousin , graham of duchray , was then to claim that the spectre of kirk had visited him in the night , and told him that he had been carried off by the fairies .
having left his widow expecting a child , the spectre of kirk told graham that he would appear at the baptism , whereupon graham was to throw an iron knife at the apparition , thus freeing kirk from the fairies ' clutches .
however , when kirk's spectre appeared , graham was apparently too shocked by the vision to throw the knife , and kirk's ghost faded away forever .
today , visitors to doon hill write their wishes on pieces of white silk , or other white cloth , and tie them to the branches of the trees for the fairies to grant .
unfortunately some people tie plastic confectionery wrappers instead , which slightly spoils the magic of the location and may harm the ecology of the forest .
it is also said that if one runs around the great ' minister's pine ' tree at the summit seven times , then the fairies will appear .
some people have tried this and afterwards claim to have seen apparitions .
others merely get a bit dizzy and fall over .
el niño el niño ( ; ) is the warm phase of the el niño–southern oscillation ( enso ) and is associated with a band of warm ocean water that develops in the central and east-central equatorial pacific ( between approximately the international date line and 120°w ) , including the area off the pacific coast of south america .
the enso is the cycle of warm and cold sea surface temperature ( sst ) of the tropical central and eastern pacific ocean .
el niño is accompanied by high air pressure in the western pacific and low air pressure in the eastern pacific .
el niño phases are known to be close to four years , however , records demonstrate the cycles have lasted between two and seven years .
during the development of el niño , rainfalls develop between september–november .
the cool phase of enso is la niña with sst in the eastern pacific below average and air pressure high in the eastern and low in western pacific .
the enso cycle , both el niño and la niña , causes global changes in temperature and rainfall .
developing countries that depend on their own agriculture and fishing , particularly those bordering the pacific ocean , are usually most affected .
in american spanish , the capitalized term " el niño " means " the boy " .
in this phase of the oscillation , the pool of warm water in the pacific near south america is often at its warmest about christmas .
the original name of the phase , " el niño de navidad " , arose centuries ago , when peruvian fishermen named the weather phenomenon after the newborn christ .
" la niña " , chosen as the " opposite " of el niño , is american spanish for " the girl " .
originally , the term " el niño " applied to an annual weak warm ocean current that ran southwards along the coast of peru and ecuador at about christmas time .
however , over time the term has evolved and now refers to the warm and negative phase of the el niño–southern oscillation and is the warming of the ocean surface or above-average sea surface temperatures in either the central and eastern tropical pacific ocean .
this warming causes a shift in the atmospheric circulation with rainfall becoming reduced over indonesia and australia , while rainfall and tropical cyclone formation increases over the tropical pacific ocean .
the low-level surface trade winds , which normally blow from east to west along the equator , either weaken or start blowing from the other direction .
historically , el niño events are thought to have been occurring for thousands of years .
for example , it is thought that el niño affected the moche in modern-day peru , who sacrificed humans in order to try to prevent the rains .
scientists have also found the chemical signatures of warmer sea surface temperatures and increased rainfall caused by el niño in coral specimens that are around *num* , *num* years old .
in around *num* when francisco pizarro made landfall on peru , he noted rainfall occurring in the deserts which subsequently became the first written record of the impacts of el niño .
modern day research and reanalysis techniques have managed to find at least *num* el niño events since *num* , with the 1982–83 , 1997–98 and 2014–16 events among the strongest on record .
currently , each country has a different threshold for what constitutes an el niño event , which is tailored to their specific interests .
for example , the australian bureau of meteorology looks at the trade winds , soi , weather models and sea surface temperatures in the nino *num* and *num* .
*num* regions , before declaring an el niño .
the united states climate prediction center ( cpc ) and the international research institute for climate and society ( iri ) looks at the sea surface temperatures in the niño *num* .
*num* region , the tropical pacific atmosphere and forecasts that noaa's oceanic niño index will equal or exceed + for several seasons in a row .
however , the japan meteorological agency declares that an el niño event has started when the average five month sea surface temperature deviation for the nino .
*num* region , is over warmer for six consecutive months or longer .
the peruvian government declares that a coastal el niño is under way if the sea surface temperatures in the niño *num* and *num* regions equal or exceed + for at least three months .
there is no consensus on if climate change will have any influence on the occurrence , strength or duration of el niño events , as research supports el niño events becoming stronger , longer , shorter and weaker .
a timeline of all the el niño episodes between *num* and *num* .
el niño events are thought to have been occurring for thousands of years .
for example , it is thought that el niño affected the moche in modern-day peru , who sacrificed humans in order to try to prevent the rains .
it is thought that there have been at least *num* el niño events since *num* , with the 1982–83 , 1997–98 and 2014–16 events among the strongest on record .
since *num* , el niño events have been observed in 2002–03 , 2004–05 , 2006–07 , 2009–10 and 2014–16 .
major enso events were recorded in the years 1790–93 , *num* , 1876–78 , *num* , 1925–26 , 1972–73 , 1982–83 , 1997–98 , and 2014–16 .
typically , this anomaly happens at irregular intervals of two to seven years , and lasts nine months to two years .
the average period length is five years .
when this warming occurs for seven to nine months , it is classified as el niño " conditions " ; when its duration is longer , it is classified as an el niño " episode " .
there is no consensus on whether climate change will have any influence on the occurrence , strength or duration of el niño events , as research supports el niño events becoming stronger , longer , shorter and weaker .
during strong el niño episodes , a secondary peak in sea surface temperature across the far eastern equatorial pacific ocean sometimes follows the initial peak .
enso conditions have occurred at two- to seven-year intervals for at least the past *num* years , but most of them have been weak .
evidence is also strong for el niño events during the early holocene epoch *num* , *num* years ago .
el niño may have led to the demise of the moche and other pre-columbian peruvian cultures .
a recent study suggests a strong el-niño effect between *num* and *num* caused poor crop yields in europe , which in turn helped touch off the french revolution .
the extreme weather produced by el niño in 1876–77 gave rise to the most deadly famines of the *ord* century .
the *num* famine alone in northern china killed up to *num* million people .
an early recorded mention of the term " el niño " to refer to climate occurred in *num* , when told the geographical society congress in lima that peruvian sailors named the warm north-flowing current " el niño " because it was most noticeable around christmas .
the phenomenon had long been of interest because of its effects on the guano industry and other enterprises that depend on biological productivity of the sea .
charles todd , in *num* , suggested droughts in india and australia tended to occur at the same time ; norman lockyer noted the same in *num* .
an el niño connection with flooding was reported in *num* by ( 1852–1919 ) and in *num* by federico alfonso pezet ( 1859–1929 ) .
in *num* , gilbert walker ( for whom the walker circulation is named ) coined the term " southern oscillation " .
he and others ( including norwegian-american meteorologist jacob bjerknes ) are generally credited with identifying the el niño effect .
the major 1982–83 el niño led to an upsurge of interest from the scientific community .
the period 1991–95 was unusual in that el niños have rarely occurred in such rapid succession .
an especially intense el niño event in *num* caused an estimated *num* % of the world's reef systems to die .
the event temporarily warmed air temperature by *num* .
*num* °c , compared to the usual increase of *num* .
*num* °c associated with el niño events .
since then , mass coral bleaching has become common worldwide , with all regions having suffered " severe bleaching " .
it is thought that there are several different types of el niño events , with the canonical eastern pacific and the modoki central pacific types being the two that receive the most attention .
these different types of el niño events are classified by where the tropical pacific sea surface temperature ( sst ) anomalies are the largest .
for example , the strongest sea surface temperature anomalies associated with the canonical eastern pacific event are located off the coast of south america .
the strongest anomalies associated with the modoki central pacific event are located near the international date line .
however , during the duration of a single event , the area with the greatest sea surface temperature anomalies can change .
the traditional niño , also called eastern pacific ( ep ) el niño , involves temperature anomalies in the eastern pacific .
however , in the last two decades , nontraditional el niños were observed , in which the usual place of the temperature anomaly ( niño *num* and *num* ) is not affected , but an anomaly arises in the central pacific ( niño *num* .
*num* ) .
the phenomenon is called central pacific ( cp ) el niño , " dateline " el niño ( because the anomaly arises near the international date line ) , or el niño " modoki " ( modoki is japanese for " similar , but different " ) .
the effects of the cp el niño are different from those of the traditional ep el niño—e .
g .
, the recently discovered el niño leads to more hurricanes more frequently making landfall in the atlantic .
there is also a scientific debate on the very existence of this " new " enso .
indeed , a number of studies dispute the reality of this statistical distinction or its increasing occurrence , or both , either arguing the reliable record is too short to detect such a distinction , finding no distinction or trend using other statistical approaches , or that other types should be distinguished , such as standard and extreme enso .
the first recorded el niño that originated in the central pacific and moved toward the east was in *num* .
recent central pacific el niños happened in 1986–87 , 1991–92 , 1994–95 , 2002–03 , 2004–05 and 2009–10 .
furthermore , there were " modoki " events in 1957–59 , 1963–64 , 1965–66 , 1968–70 , 1977–78 and 1979–80 .
some sources say that the el niños of 2006-07 and 2014-16 were also central pacific el niños .
el nino affects the global climate and disrupts normal weather patterns , which as a result can lead to intense storms in some places and droughts in others .
name="niwa el niño / la / most tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator , then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving into the main belt of the westerlies .
areas west of japan and korea tend to experience much fewer september–november tropical cyclone impacts during el niño and neutral years .
during el niño years , the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130°e , which would favor the japanese archipelago .
within the atlantic ocean vertical wind shear is increased , which inhibits tropical cyclone genesis and intensification , by causing the westerly winds in the atmosphere to be stronger .
the atmosphere over the atlantic ocean can also be drier and more stable during el niño events , which can also inhibit tropical cyclone genesis and intensification .
within the eastern pacific basin : el niño events contribute to decreased easterly vertical wind shear and favours above-normal hurricane activity .
however , the impacts of the enso state in this region can vary and are strongly influenced by background climate patterns .
the western pacific basin experiences a change in the location of where tropical cyclones form during el niño events , without a major change in how many develop each year .
a change in the location of where tropical cyclones form also occurs within the southern pacific ocean between 135°e and 120°w , with tropical cyclones more likely to occur within the southern pacific basin than the australian region .
as a result of this change tropical cyclones are *num* % less likely to make landfall on queensland , while the risk of a tropical cyclone is elevated for island nations like niue , french polynesia , tonga , tuvalu and the cook islands .
a study of climate records has shown that el niño events in the equatorial pacific are generally associated with a warm tropical north atlantic in the following spring and summer .
about half of el niño events persist sufficiently into the spring months for the western hemisphere warm pool to become unusually large in summer .
occasionally , el niño's effect on the atlantic walker circulation over south america strengthens the easterly trade winds in the western equatorial atlantic region .
as a result , an unusual cooling may occur in the eastern equatorial atlantic in spring and summer following el niño peaks in winter .
cases of el niño-type events in both oceans simultaneously have been linked to severe famines related to the extended failure of monsoon rains .
many enso linkages exist in the high southern latitudes around antarctica .
specifically , el niño conditions result in high-pressure anomalies over the amundsen and bellingshausen seas , causing reduced sea ice and increased poleward heat fluxes in these sectors , as well as the ross sea .
the weddell sea , conversely , tends to become colder with more sea ice during el niño .
the exact opposite heating and atmospheric pressure anomalies occur during la niña .
this pattern of variability is known as the antarctic dipole mode , although the antarctic response to enso forcing is not ubiquitous .
observations of el niño events since *num* , show that impacts associated with el niño events depend on what season it is .
however , while certain events and impacts are expected to occur during events , it is not certain or guaranteed that they will occur .
the impacts that generally do occur during most el niño events include below-average rainfall over indonesia and northern south america , while above average rainfall occurs in southeastern south america , eastern equatorial africa , and the southern united states .
during el niño events , the shift in rainfall away from the western pacific may mean that rainfall across australia is reduced .
over the southern part of the continent , warmer than average temperatures can be recorded as weather systems are more mobile and fewer blocking areas of high pressure occur .
the onset of the indo-australian monsoon in tropical australia is delayed by two to six weeks , which as a consequence means that rainfall is reduced over the northern tropics .
the risk of a significant bushfire season in south-eastern australia is higher following an el niño event , especially when it is combined with a positive indian ocean dipole event .
during an el niño event , new zealand tends to experience stronger or more frequent westerly winds during their summer , which leads to an elevated risk of drier than normal conditions along the east coast .
there is more rain than usual though on new zealand's west coast , because of the barrier effect of the north island mountain ranges and the southern alps .
fiji generally experiences drier than normal conditions during an el niño , which can lead to drought becoming established over the islands .
however , the main impacts on the island nation is felt about a year after the event becomes established .
within the samoan islands , below average rainfall and higher than normal temperatures are recorded during el niño events , which can lead to droughts and forest fires on the islands .
other impacts include a decrease in the sea level , possibility of coral bleaching in the marine environment and an increased risk of a tropical cyclone affecting samoa .
in africa , east africa — including kenya , tanzania , and the white nile basin — experiences , in the long rains from march to may , wetter-than-normal conditions .
conditions are also drier than normal from december to february in south-central africa , mainly in zambia , zimbabwe , mozambique , and botswana .
as warm water spreads from the west pacific and the indian ocean to the east pacific , it takes the rain with it , causing extensive drought in the western pacific and rainfall in the normally dry eastern pacific .
singapore experienced the driest february in *num* since records began in *num* , with only *num* .
*num* mm of rain falling in the month and temperatures hitting as high as *num* °c on *num* february .
the years *num* and *num* had the next driest februaries , when *num* .
*num* mm of rain fell .
el niño's effects on europe are controversial , complex and difficult to analyse , as it is one of several factors that influence the weather over the continent and other factors can overwhelm the signal .
over north america , the main temperature and precipitation impacts of el niño , generally occur in the six months between october and march .
in particular the majority of canada generally has milder than normal winters and springs , with the exception of eastern canada where no significant impacts occur .
within the united states , the impacts generally observed during the six-month period include ; wetter-than-average conditions along the gulf coast between texas and florida , while drier conditions are observed in hawaii , the ohio valley , pacific northwest and the rocky mountains .
over california and the south-western united states , there is a weak relationship between el nino and above-average precipitation , as it strongly depends on the strength of the el niño event and other factors .
the synoptic condition for the tehuano wind , or " tehuantepecer " , is associated with a high-pressure area forming in sierra madre of mexico in the wake of an advancing cold front , which causes winds to accelerate through the isthmus of tehuantepec .
tehuantepecers primarily occur during the cold season months for the region in the wake of cold fronts , between october and february , with a summer maximum in july caused by the westward extension of the azores high .
wind magnitude is greater during el niño years than during la niña years , due to the more frequent cold frontal incursions during el niño winters .
its effects can last from a few hours to six days .
some el niño events were recorded in the isotope signals of plants , and that had helped centifics to study his impact .
because el niño's warm pool feeds thunderstorms above , it creates increased rainfall across the east-central and eastern pacific ocean , including several portions of the south american west coast .
the effects of el niño in south america are direct and stronger than in north america .
an el niño is associated with warm and very wet weather months in april–october along the coasts of northern peru and ecuador , causing major flooding whenever the event is strong or extreme .
the effects during the months of february , march , and april may become critical along the west coast of south america , el niño reduces the upwelling of cold , nutrient-rich water that sustains large fish populations , which in turn sustain abundant sea birds , whose droppings support the fertilizer industry .
the reduction in upwelling leads to fish kills off the shore of peru .
the local fishing industry along the affected coastline can suffer during long-lasting el niño events .
the world's largest fishery collapsed due to overfishing during the *num* el niño peruvian anchoveta reduction .
during the 1982–83 event , jack mackerel and anchoveta populations were reduced , scallops increased in warmer water , but hake followed cooler water down the continental slope , while shrimp and sardines moved southward , so some catches decreased while others increased .
horse mackerel have increased in the region during warm events .
shifting locations and types of fish due to changing conditions provide challenges for fishing industries .
peruvian sardines have moved during el niño events to chilean areas .
other conditions provide further complications , such as the government of chile in *num* creating restrictions on the fishing areas for self-employed fishermen and industrial fleets .
the enso variability may contribute to the great success of small , fast-growing species along the peruvian coast , as periods of low population removes predators in the area .
similar effects benefit migratory birds that travel each spring from predator-rich tropical areas to distant winter-stressed nesting areas .
southern brazil and northern argentina also experience wetter than normal conditions , but mainly during the spring and early summer .
central chile receives a mild winter with large rainfall , and the peruvian-bolivian altiplano is sometimes exposed to unusual winter snowfall events .
drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the amazon river basin , colombia , and central america .
when el niño conditions last for many months , extensive ocean warming and the reduction in easterly trade winds limits upwelling of cold nutrient-rich deep water , and its economic effect on local fishing for an international market can be serious .
more generally , el niño can affect commodity prices and the macroeconomy of different countries .
it can constrain the supply of rain-driven agricultural commodities ; reduce agricultural output , construction , and services activities ; create food-price and generalised inflation ; and may trigger social unrest in commodity-dependent poor countries that primarily rely on imported food .
a university of cambridge working paper shows that while australia , chile , indonesia , india , japan , new zealand and south africa face a short-lived fall in economic activity in response to an el niño shock , other countries may actually benefit from an el niño weather shock ( either directly or indirectly through positive spillovers from major trading partners ) , for instance , argentina , canada , mexico and the united states .
furthermore , most countries experience short-run inflationary pressures following an el niño shock , while global energy and non-fuel commodity prices increase .
the imf estimates a significant el niño can boost the gdp of the united states by about *num* .
*num* % ( due largely to lower heating bills ) and reduce the gdp of indonesia by about *num* .
*num* % .
extreme weather conditions related to the el niño cycle correlate with changes in the incidence of epidemic diseases .
for example , the el niño cycle is associated with increased risks of some of the diseases transmitted by mosquitoes , such as malaria , dengue fever , and rift valley fever .
cycles of malaria in india , venezuela , brazil , and colombia have now been linked to el niño .
outbreaks of another mosquito-transmitted disease , australian encephalitis ( murray valley encephalitis—mve ) , occur in temperate south-east australia after heavy rainfall and flooding , which are associated with la niña events .
a severe outbreak of rift valley fever occurred after extreme rainfall in north-eastern kenya and southern somalia during the 1997–98 el niño .
enso conditions have also been related to kawasaki disease incidence in japan and the west coast of the united states , via the linkage to tropospheric winds across the north pacific ocean .
enso may be linked to civil conflicts .
scientists at the earth institute of columbia university , having analyzed data from *num* to *num* , suggest enso may have had a role in *num* % of all civil conflicts since *num* , with the risk of annual civil conflict doubling from *num* % to *num* % in countries affected by enso during el niño years relative to la niña years .
dioscoreales the dioscoreales are an order of monocotyledonous flowering plants in modern classification systems , such as the angiosperm phylogeny group and the angiosperm phylogeny web .
within the monocots dioscoreales are grouped in the lilioid monocots where they are in a sister group relationship with the pandanales .
of necessity the dioscoreales contain the family dioscoreaceae which includes the yam ( " dioscorea " ) that is used as an important food source in many regions around the globe .
older systems tended to place all lilioid monocots with reticulate veined leaves ( such as smilacaceae and stemonaceae together with dioscoraceae ) in dioscoreales .
as currently circumscribed by phylogenetic analysis using combined morphology and molecular methods , dioscreales contains many reticulate veined vines in dioscoraceae , it also includes the myco-heterotrophic burmanniaceae and the autotrophic nartheciaceae .
the order consists of three families , *num* genera and about *num* species .
dioscoreales are vines or herbaceous forest floor plants .
they may be achlorophyllous or saprophytic .
synapomorphies include tuberous roots , glandular hairs , seed coat characteristics and the presence of calcium oxalate crystals .
other characteristics of the order include the presence of saponin steroids , annular vascular bundles that are found in both the stem and leaf .
the leaves are often unsheathed at the base , have a distinctive petiole and reticulate veined lamina .
alternatively they may be small and scale-like with a sheathed base .
the flowers are actinomorphic , and may be bisexual or dioecious , while the flowers or inflorescence bear glandular hairs .
the perianth may be conspicuous or reduced and the style is short with well developed style branches .
the tepals persist in the development of the fruit , which is a dry capsule or berry .
in the seed , the endotegmen is tanniferous and the embryo short .
all of the species except the genera placed in nartheciaceae express simultaneous microsporogenesis .
plants in nartheciaceae show successive microsporogenesis which is one of the traits indicating that the family is sister to all the other members included in the order .
for the early history from lindley ( *num* ) onwards , see caddick " et al .
" ( *num* ) table *num* , caddick et al .
( 2002a ) table *num* and table *num* in bouman ( *num* ) .
the taxonomic classification of dioscoreales has been complicated by the presence of a number of morphological features reminiscent of the dicotyledons , leading some authors to place the order as intermediate between the monocotyledons and the dicotyledons .
while lindley did not use the term " dioscoreales " , he placed the family dioscoraceae together with four other families in what he referred to as an alliance ( the equivalent of the modern order ) called dictyogens .
he reflected the uncertainty as to the place of this alliance by placing it as a class of its own between endogens ( monocots ) and exogens ( dicots ) the botanical authority is given to von martius ( *num* ) by apg for his description of the dioscoreae family or " ordo " , while other sources cite hooker ( dioscoreales hook .
f .
) for his use of the term " dioscorales " in *num* with a single family , dioscoreae .
however , in his more definitive work , the " genera plantara " ( *num* ) , he simply placed dioscoraceae in the epigynae " series " .
although charles darwin's origin of species ( *num* ) preceded bentham and hooker's publication , the latter project was commenced much earlier and george bentham was initially sceptical of darwinism .
the new phyletic approach changed the way that taxonomists considered plant classification , incorporating evolutionary information into their schemata , but this did little to further define the circumscription of dioscoreaceae .
the major works in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century employing this approach were in the german literature .
authors such as eichler , engler and wettstein placed this family in the liliiflorae , a major subdivision of monocotyledons .
it remained to hutchinson ( *num* ) to resurrect the dioscoreales to group dioscoreaceae and related families together .
hutchinson's circumscription of dioscoreales included three other families in addition to dioscoreaceae , stenomeridaceae , trichopodaceae and roxburghiaceae .
of these only trichopodaceae was included in the angiosperm phylogeny group ( apg ) classification ( see below ) , but was subsumed into dioscoraceae .
stenomeridaceae , as " stenomeris " was also included in dioscoreaceae as subfamily stenomeridoideae , the remaining genera being grouped in subfamily dioscoreoideae .
roxburghiaceae on the other hand was segregated in the sister order pandanales as stemonaceae .
most taxonomists in the twentieth century ( the exception was the *num* cronquist system which placed most such plants in order liliales , subclass liliidae , class liliopsida=monocotyledons , division magnoliophyta=angiosperms ) recognised dioscoreales as a distinct order , but demonstrated wide variations in its composition .
dahlgren , in the second version of his taxonomic classification ( *num* ) raised the liliiflorae to a superorder and placed dioscoreales as an order within it .
in his system , dioscoreales contained only three families , dioscoreaceae , stemonaceae ( " i .
e .
" hutchinson's roxburghiaceae ) and trilliaceae .
the latter two families had been treated as a separate order ( stemonales , or roxburghiales ) by other authors , such as huber ( *num* ) .
the apg would later assign these to pandanales and liliales respectively .
dahlgren's construction of dioscoreaceae included the stenomeridaceae and trichopodaceae , doubting these were distinct , and croomiaceae in stemonaceae .
furthermore , he expressed doubts about the order's homogeneity , especially trilliaceae .
the dioscoreales at that time were marginally distinguishable from the asparagales .
in his examination of huber's stemonales , he found that the two constituent families had as close an affinity to dioscoreaceae as to each other , and hence included them .
he also considered closely related families and their relationship to dioscoreales , such as the monogeneric taccaceae , then in its own order , taccales .
similar considerations were discussed with respect to two asparagales families , smilacaceae and petermanniaceae .
in dahlgren's third and final version ( *num* ) that broader circumscription of dioscoreales was created within the superorder lilianae , subclass liliidae ( monocotyledons ) , class magnoliopsida ( angiosperms ) and comprised the seven families dioscoreaceae , petermanniaceae , smilacaceae , stemonaceae , taccaceae , trichopodaceae and trilliaceae .
thismiaceae has either been treated as a separate family closely related to burmanniaceae or as a tribe ( thismieae ) within a more broadly defined burmanniaceae , forming a separate burmanniales order in the dahlgren system .
the related nartheciaceae were treated as tribe narthecieae within the melanthiaceae in a third order , the melanthiales , by dahlgren .
dahlgren considered the dioscoreales to most strongly resemble the ancestral monocotyledons , and hence sharing " dicotyledonous " characteristics , making it the most central monocotyledon order .
of these seven families , bouman considered dioscoreaceae , trichopodaceae , stemonaceae and taccaceae to represent the " core " families of the order .
however , that study also indicated both a clear delineation of the order from other orders particularly asparagales , and a lack of homogeneity within the order .
the increasing availability of molecular phylogenetics methods in addition to morphological characteristics in the 1990s led to major reconsiderations of the relationships within the monocotyledons .
in that large multi-institutional examination of the seed plants using the plastid gene " rbc"l the authors used dahlgren's system as their basis , but followed thorne ( *num* ) in altering the suffixes of the superorders from " "-iflorae" " to " "-anae" " .
this demonstrated that the lilianae comprised three lineages corresponding to dahlgren's dioscoreales , liliales , and asparagales orders .
under the angiosperm phylogeny group system of *num* , which took dahlgren's system as a basis , the order was placed in the monocot clade and comprised the five families burmanniaceae , dioscoreaceae , taccaceae , thismiaceae and trichopodaceae .
in apg ii ( *num* ) , a number of changes were made to dioscoreales , as a result of an extensive study by caddick and colleagues ( *num* ) , using an analysis of three genes , " rbc"l , " atp"b and 18s rdna , in addition to morphology .
these studies resulted in a re-examination of the relationships between most of the genera within the order .
thismiaceae was shown to be a sister group to burmanniaceae , and so was included in it .
the monotypic families taccaceae and trichopodaceae were included in dioscoreaceae , while nartheciaceae could also be grouped within dioscoreales .
apg iii ( *num* ) did not change this , so the order now comprises three families burmanniaceae , dioscoreaceae and nartheciaceae .
although further research on the deeper relationships within dioscoreales continues , the apg iv ( *num* ) authors felt it was still premature to propose a restructuring of the order .
specifically these issues involve conflicting information as to the relationship between " thismia " and burmanniaceae , and hence whether thismiaceae should be subsumed in the latter , or reinstated .
molecular phylogenetics in dioscoreales poses special problems due to the absence of plastid genes in mycoheterotrophs .
dioscoreales is monophyletic and is placed as a sister order to pandanales , as shown in cladogram i .
the data for the evolution of the order is collected from molecular analyses since there are no such fossils found .
it is estimated that dioscoreales and its sister clade pandanales split up around *num* millions of years ago during early cretaceous when the stem group was formed .
then it took *num* to *num* millions of years for the crown group to differentiate in mid cretaceous .
the three families of dioscreales constitutes about *num* genera and about *num* species making it one of the smaller monocot orders .
of these , the largest group is " dioscorea " ( yams ) with about *num* species .
by contrast the second largest genus is " burmannia " with about *num* species , and most have only one or two .
some authors , preferring the original apg ( *num* ) families , continue to treat thismiaceae separately from burmanniaceae and taccaceae from dioscoreaceae .
but in the *num* study of hertwerk and colleagues , seven genera representing all three families were examined with an eight gene dataset .
dioscoreales was monophyletic and three subclades were represented corresponding to the apg families .
dioscoreaceae and burmanniaceae were in a sister group relationship .
named after the type genus " dioscorea " , which in turn was named by linnaeus in *num* to honour the greek physician and botanist dioscorides .
species from this order are distributed across all of the continents except antarctica .
they are mainly tropical or subtropical representatives but however there are members of dioscoreaceae and nartheciaceae families found in cooler regions of europe and north america .
order dioscoreales contains plants that are able to form an underground organ for reservation of nutritions as many other monocots .
an exception is the family burmanniaceae which is entirely myco-heterotrophic and contains species that lack photosynthetic abilities .
the three families included in order dioscoreales also represent three different ecological groups of plants .
dioscoreaceae contains mainly vines ( " dioscorea " ) and other crawling species ( " epipetrum " ) .
nartheciaceae on the other hand is a family composed of herbaceous plants with a rather lily-like appearance ( " aletris " ) while burmanniaceae is entirely myco-heterotrophic group .
many members of dioscoreaceae produce tuberous starchy roots ( yams ) which form staple foods in tropical regions .
they have also been the source of steroids for the pharmaceutical industry , including the production of oral contraceptives .
damon runyon alfred damon runyon ( october *num* , *num* – december *num* , *num* ) was an american newspaperman and short-story writer .
he was best known for his short stories celebrating the world of broadway in new york city that grew out of the prohibition era .
to new yorkers of his generation , a " damon runyon character " evoked a distinctive social type from the brooklyn or midtown demi-monde .
the adjective " runyonesque " refers to this type of character as well as to the type of situations and dialog that runyon depicted .
he spun humorous and sentimental tales of gamblers , hustlers , actors , and gangsters , few of whom go by " square " names , preferring instead colorful monikers such as " nathan detroit " , " benny southstreet " , " big jule " , " harry the horse " , " good time charley " , " dave the dude " , or " the seldom seen kid " .
his distinctive vernacular style is known as " runyonese " : a mixture of formal speech and colorful slang , almost always in present tense , and always devoid of contractions .
he is credited with coining the phrase " hooray henry " , a term now used in british english to describe an upper-class , loud-mouthed , arrogant twit .
runyon's fictional world is also known to the general public through the musical " guys and dolls " based on two of his stories , " the idyll of miss sarah brown " and " blood pressure " .
the musical additionally borrows characters and story elements from a few other runyon stories , most notably " pick the winner " .
the film " little miss marker " ( and its two remakes , " sorrowful jones " and the *num* " little miss marker " ) grew from his short story of the same name .
runyon was also a well-known newspaper reporter , covering sports and general news for decades for various publications and syndicates owned by william randolph hearst .
already famous for his fiction , he wrote a well-remembered " present tense " article on franklin delano roosevelt's presidential inauguration in *num* for the universal service , a hearst syndicate , which was merged with the co-owned international news service in *num* .
damon runyon was born alfred damon runyan to alfred lee and elizabeth ( damon ) runyan .
his relatives in his birthplace of manhattan , kansas included several newspapermen .
his grandfather was a newspaper printer from new jersey who had relocated to manhattan , kansas in *num* , and his father was editor of his own newspaper in the town .
in *num* runyon's father was forced to sell his newspaper , and the family moved westward .
the family eventually settled in pueblo , colorado in *num* , where runyon spent the rest of his youth .
by most accounts , he attended school only through the fourth grade .
he began to work in the newspaper trade under his father in pueblo .
in present-day pueblo , runyon field , the damon runyon repertory theater company , and runyon lake are named in his honor .
in *num* , when still in his teens , runyon enlisted in the u .
s .
army to fight in the spanish–american war .
while in the service , he was assigned to write for the " manila freedom " and " soldier's letter " .
after his military service , he worked for various colorado newspapers , beginning in pueblo .
his first job as a reporter was in september *num* , when he was hired by the " pueblo star " ; he then worked in the rocky mountain area during the first decade of the 1900s : at the " denver daily news " , he served as " sporting editor " ( what would today be called " sports editor " ) and then worked as a staff writer .
his expertise was in covering the semi-professional teams in colorado ; he even briefly managed a semi-pro team in trinidad , colorado .
at one of the newspapers where he worked , the spelling of his last name was changed from " runyan " to " runyon " , a change he let stand .
after a notable failure in trying to organize a colorado minor baseball league , which lasted less than a week , runyon moved to new york city in *num* .
in his first new york byline , the " american " editor dropped the " alfred " and the name " damon runyon " appeared for the first time .
for the next ten years he covered the new york giants and professional boxing for the " new york american " .
he was the hearst newspapers ' baseball columnist for many years , beginning in *num* , and his knack for spotting the eccentric and the unusual , on the field or in the stands , is credited with revolutionizing the way baseball was covered .
perhaps as confirmation , runyon was inducted into the writers ' wing ( the j .
g .
taylor spink award ) of the baseball hall of fame in *num* .
he is also a member of the international boxing hall of fame and is known for dubbing heavyweight champion james j .
braddock , the " cinderella man " .
runyon frequently contributed sports poems to the " american " on boxing and baseball themes , and also wrote numerous short stories and essays .
one year , while covering spring training in texas , he met pancho villa in a bar and later accompanied the unsuccessful american expedition into mexico searching for villa .
it was while he was in mexico that he met the young girl whom he eventually married .
gambling , particularly on craps or horse races , was a common theme of runyon's works , and he was a notorious gambler himself .
one of his paraphrases from a well-known line in ecclesiastes ran : " the race is not always to the swift , nor the battle to the strong , but that's how the smart money bets .
" a heavy drinker as a young man , he seems to have quit drinking soon after arriving in new york , after his drinking nearly cost him the courtship of the woman who became his first wife , ellen egan .
he remained a heavy smoker .
his best friend was mobster accountant otto berman , and he incorporated berman into several of his stories under the alias " regret , the horse player " .
when berman was killed in a hit on berman's boss , dutch schultz , runyon quickly assumed the role of damage control for his deceased friend , correcting erroneous press releases ( including one that stated berman was one of schultz's gunmen , to which runyon replied , " otto would have been as effective a bodyguard as a two-year-old .
" ) .
runyon's marriage to ellen egan produced two children ( mary and damon , jr .
) , but broke up in *num* over rumors that runyon had become infatuated with patrice amati del grande , a mexican woman he had first met while covering the pancho villa raids in *num* and discovered once again in new york , when she called the " american " seeking him out .
runyon had promised her in mexico that if she would complete the education he paid for her , he would find her a dancing job in new york .
she became his companion after he separated from his wife .
after ellen runyon's death , runyon and del grande married on july *num* , *num* ; that marriage ended in *num* when she left him for a younger man .
runyon died in new york city from throat cancer in late *num* , at age *num* .
his body was cremated , and his ashes were illegally scattered from a dc-3 airplane over broadway in manhattan by captain eddie rickenbacker on december *num* , *num* .
the family plot of damon runyon is located at woodlawn cemetery in the bronx , new york .
the english comedy writer frank muir comments that runyon's plots were , in the manner of o .
henry , neatly constructed with professionally wrought endings , but their distinction lay in the manner of their telling , as the author invented a peculiar argot for his characters to speak .
runyon almost totally avoids the past tense ( english humourist e .
c .
bentley thought there was only one instance , and was willing to " lay plenty of *num* to *num* that it is nothing but a misprint " but " was " appears in the short stories " the lily of st pierre " and " a piece of pie " ; " had " appears in " the lily of st pierre " , " undertaker song " and " bloodhounds of broadway " ) , and makes little use of the future tense , using the present for both .
he also avoided the conditional , using instead the future indicative in situations that would normally require conditional .
an example : " now most any doll on broadway will be very glad indeed to have handsome jack madigan give her a tumble " ( " guys and dolls " , " social error " ) .
e .
c .
bentley comments that " there is a sort of ungrammatical purity about it [ runyon's resolute avoidance of the past tense ] , an almost religious exactitude .
" there is an homage to runyon that makes use of this peculiarity ( " chronic offender " by spider robinson ) which involves a time machine and a man going by the name " harry the horse " .
he uses many slang terms ( which go unexplained in his stories ) , such as : there are many recurring composite phrases such as : e .
c .
bentley notes that runyon's " telling use of the recurrent phrase and fixed epithet " demonstrates a debt to homer .
runyon's stories also employ occasional rhyming slang , similar to the cockney variety but native to new york ( e .
g .
: " miss missouri martin makes the following crack one night to her : ' well , i do not see any simple simon on your lean and linger .
' this is miss missouri martin's way of saying she sees no diamond on miss billy perry's finger .
" ( from " romance in the roaring forties " ) ) .
the comic effect of his style results partly from the juxtaposition of broad slang with mock-pomposity .
women , when not " dolls " , " judies " , " pancakes " , " tomatoes " , or " broads " , may be " characters of a female nature " , for example .
he typically avoided contractions such as " don't " in the example above , which also contributes significantly to the humorously pompous effect .
in one sequence , a gangster tells another character to do as he is told , or else " find another world in which to live " .
runyon's short stories are told in the first person by a protagonist who is never named , and whose role is unclear ; he knows many gangsters and does not appear to have a job , but he does not admit to any criminal involvement , and seems to be largely a bystander .
he describes himself as " being known to one and all as a guy who is just around " .
the damon runyon theatre dramatized *num* of runyon's works in *num* , and for these the protagonist was given the name " broadway " , although it was admitted that this was not his real name , much in the way " harry the horse " and " sorrowful jones " are aliases .
there are many collections of runyon's stories : in particular " runyon on broadway " and " runyon from first to last " between them provide extensive coverage .
the latter is claimed to contain all of runyon's stories ( i .
e .
fiction ) not included in " runyon on broadway " .
in fact , there are two broadway stories originally published in " collier's weekly " but not included in either collection : " maybe a queen " and " leopard's spots " , both collected in " more guys and dolls " ( *num* ) .
"runyon on broadway " contains the following stories , all of which are broadway stories written in runyonese : more than somewhat furthermore take it easy "runyon from first to last " includes the following stories and sketches : the first stories ( early non-broadway stories ) : stories à la carte ( broadway stories written in runyonese ) : the last stories ( broadway stories written in runyonese ) : written in sickness ( sketches ) : twenty of his stories became motion pictures .
"the damon runyon theater " radio series dramatized *num* of runyon's short stories in weekly broadcasts running from october *num* to september *num* ( with reruns until *num* ) .
the series was produced by alan ladd's mayfair transcription company for syndication to local radio stations .
john brown played the character " broadway " , who doubled as host and narrator .
the cast also comprised alan reed , luis van rooten , joseph du val , gerald mohr , frank lovejoy , herb vigran , sheldon leonard , william conrad , jeff chandler , lionel stander , sidney miller , olive deering and joe de santis .
pat o'brien was initially engaged for the role of " broadway " .
the original stories were adapted for the radio by russell hughes .
"broadway's new york had a crisis each week , though the streets had a rose-tinged aura " , wrote radio historian john dunning .
" the sad shows then were all the sadder ; plays like " for a pal " had a special poignance .
the bulk of runyon's work had been untapped by radio , and the well was deep .
" "damon runyon theatre " aired on cbs-tv from *num* to *num* .
mike mcshane told runyon stories as monologues on british tv in *num* , and an accompanying book was released , both called " broadway stories " .
abiathar abiathar ( " ’eḇyāṯār " , " the father is great " ) , in the hebrew bible , son of ahimelech or ahijah , high priest at nob , the fourth in descent from eli ( *num* sam .
*num* : *num* ) and the last of eli's house .
the only one of the priests to escape from saul's massacre , he fled to david at keilah , taking with him the ephod and other priestly regalia ( *num* sam .
*num* : *num* f .
, *num* : *num* , *num* ) .
he was of great service to david , especially at the time of the rebellion of absalom ( *num* sam .
*num* : *num* , *num* , *num* , *num* : *num* ) .
in *num* kings *num* : *num* zadok and abiathar are found acting together as priests under solomon .
in *num* kings *num* : *num* , *num* , *num* , however , abiathar appears as a supporter of adonijah , and in *num* : *num* and *num* it is said that he was deposed by solomon and banished to anathoth .
in *num* sam .
*num* : *num* " abiathar , the son of achimelech " should be read , with the syriac , for " achimelech , the son of abiathar .
" a similar confusion occurs in gospel of mark *num* : *num* : in reporting jesus ' words , the evangelist used the name abiathar when we might expect to see jesus mention his father ahimelech .
suggestions made to resolve the difficulty — e .
g .
that father and son each bore the same double name , or that abiathar officiated during his father's lifetime and in his father's stead—have been supported by great names , but have not been fully accepted .
when his father and the priests of nob were slain on the command of saul , abiathar escaped , bearing with him the ephod .
rabbinical literature that linked the later extermination of the male descendants of david with the priests of nob , also link the survival of david's descendant joash with that of abiathar .
( sanh .
95b ) abiathar joined david , who was then in the cave of adullam ( *num* sam .
*num* : 20-23 ; *num* : *num* ) .
he remained with david , and became priest of the party of which he was the leader ( *num* sam .
*num* : *num* ) .
when david ascended the throne of judah , abiathar was appointed high priest ( *num* chr .
*num* : *num* ; *num* kings *num* : *num* ) and the " king's counselor " ( *num* chr .
*num* : 33-34 ) .
meanwhile , zadok , of the house of eleazar , had been made high priest .
according to the jewish encyclopedia abiathar was deposed from office when he was deserted by the holy spirit without which the urim and thummin could not be consulted .
another version says he was co-pontiff with zadok during king david .
he supported prince adonijah over prince solomon , and was deposed by him and exiled in anathoth .
these appointments continued in force till the end of david's reign ( *num* kings *num* : *num* ) .
abiathar was deposed ( the sole historical instance of the deposition of a high priest ) and banished to his home at anathoth by solomon , because he took part in the attempt to raise adonijah to the throne .
the priesthood thus passed from the house of ithamar ( *num* sam .
*num* : 30-36 ; *num* kings *num* : *num* ; *num* : *num* , *num* ) .
zadok now became sole high priest .
abiathar's removal from the priesthood fulfilled that other part of the curse on the house of eli—that the priesthood would pass out of the house of eli .
in georgian traditions , abiathar and sidonia were a legendary jewish priest of mtskheta and his daughter .
abiathar is said to have been the first person saint nino converted to christianity .
"abiathar " ( in modern hebrew ) is sometimes used as a male given name in contemporary israel ( see eviatar banai , eviatar zerubavel , eviatar manor ) .
dionysius thrax dionysius thrax ( , , contemporary koine : ; 170–90 bc ) was a hellenistic grammarian and a pupil of aristarchus of samothrace .
his place of origin was not thrace as the epithet " thrax " denotes , but probably alexandria ( his father's descent was thracian ) .
he lived and worked in this city but later taught at rhodes .
the first extant grammar of greek , " art of grammar " ( " tékhnē grammatiké " ) is attributed to him but many scholars today doubt that the work really belongs solely to him due to the difference between the technical approach of most of the work and the more literary approach ( similar to the *ord* century's alexandrian tradition ) of the first few sections .
it concerns itself primarily with a morphological description of greek , lacking any treatment of syntax .
the work was translated into armenian and syriac in the early christian era .
thrax defines grammar at the beginning of the " tékhnē " as " the practical knowledge of the general usages of poets and prose writers .
" thus dionysius thrax , like contemporary alexandrian scholars who edited attic greek and homeric texts , was concerned with facilitating the teaching of classic greek literature to an audience who spoke koine greek .
chemical reaction a chemical reaction is a process that leads to the chemical transformation of one set of chemical substances to another .
classically , chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms , with no change to the nuclei ( no change to the elements present ) , and can often be described by a chemical equation .
nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes can occur .
the substance ( or substances ) initially involved in a chemical reaction are called reactants or reagents .
chemical reactions are usually characterized by a chemical change , and they yield one or more products , which usually have properties different from the reactants .
reactions often consist of a sequence of individual sub-steps , the so-called elementary reactions , and the information on the precise course of action is part of the reaction mechanism .
chemical reactions are described with chemical equations , which symbolically present the starting materials , end products , and sometimes intermediate products and reaction conditions .
chemical reactions happen at a characteristic reaction rate at a given temperature and chemical concentration .
typically , reaction rates increase with increasing temperature because there is more thermal energy available to reach the activation energy necessary for breaking bonds between atoms .
reactions may proceed in the forward or reverse direction until they go to completion or reach equilibrium .
reactions that proceed in the forward direction to approach equilibrium are often described as spontaneous , requiring no input of free energy to go forward .
non-spontaneous reactions require input of free energy to go forward ( examples include charging a battery by applying an external electrical power source , or photosynthesis driven by absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the form of sunlight ) .
different chemical reactions are used in combinations during chemical synthesis in order to obtain a desired product .
in biochemistry , a consecutive series of chemical reactions ( where the product of one reaction is the reactant of the next reaction ) form metabolic pathways .
these reactions are often catalyzed by protein enzymes .
enzymes increase the rates of biochemical reactions , so that metabolic syntheses and decompositions impossible under ordinary conditions can occur at the temperatures and concentrations present within a cell .
the general concept of a chemical reaction has been extended to reactions between entities smaller than atoms , including nuclear reactions , radioactive decays , and reactions between elementary particles , as described by quantum field theory .
chemical reactions such as combustion in fire , fermentation and the reduction of ores to metals were known since antiquity .
initial theories of transformation of materials were developed by greek philosophers , such as the four-element theory of empedocles stating that any substance is composed of the four basic elements – fire , water , air and earth .
in the middle ages , chemical transformations were studied by alchemists .
they attempted , in particular , to convert lead into gold , for which purpose they used reactions of lead and lead-copper alloys with sulfur .
the production of chemical substances that do not normally occur in nature has long been tried , such as the synthesis of sulfuric and nitric acids attributed to the controversial alchemist jābir ibn hayyān .
the process involved heating of sulfate and nitrate minerals such as copper sulfate , alum and saltpeter .
in the *ord* century , johann rudolph glauber produced hydrochloric acid and sodium sulfate by reacting sulfuric acid and sodium chloride .
with the development of the lead chamber process in *num* and the leblanc process , allowing large-scale production of sulfuric acid and sodium carbonate , respectively , chemical reactions became implemented into the industry .
further optimization of sulfuric acid technology resulted in the contact process in the 1880s , and the haber process was developed in 1909–1910 for ammonia synthesis .
from the *ord* century , researchers including jan baptist van helmont , robert boyle , and isaac newton tried to establish theories of the experimentally observed chemical transformations .
the phlogiston theory was proposed in *num* by johann joachim becher .
it postulated the existence of a fire-like element called " phlogiston " , which was contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion .
this proved to be false in *num* by antoine lavoisier who found the correct explanation of the combustion as reaction with oxygen from the air .
joseph louis gay-lussac recognized in *num* that gases always react in a certain relationship with each other .
based on this idea and the atomic theory of john dalton , joseph proust had developed the law of definite proportions , which later resulted in the concepts of stoichiometry and chemical equations .
regarding the organic chemistry , it was long believed that compounds obtained from living organisms were too complex to be obtained synthetically .
according to the concept of vitalism , organic matter was endowed with a " vital force " and distinguished from inorganic materials .
this separation was ended however by the synthesis of urea from inorganic precursors by friedrich wöhler in *num* .
other chemists who brought major contributions to organic chemistry include alexander william williamson with his synthesis of ethers and christopher kelk ingold , who , among many discoveries , established the mechanisms of substitution reactions .
chemical equations are used to graphically illustrate chemical reactions .
they consist of chemical or structural formulas of the reactants on the left and those of the products on the right .
they are separated by an arrow ( → ) which indicates the direction and type of the reaction ; the arrow is read as the word " yields " .
the tip of the arrow points in the direction in which the reaction proceeds .
a double arrow ( ) pointing in opposite directions is used for equilibrium reactions .
equations should be balanced according to the stoichiometry , the number of atoms of each species should be the same on both sides of the equation .
this is achieved by scaling the number of involved molecules ( , b , / and / in a schematic example below ) by the appropriate integers " a , b , c " and " d " .
more elaborate reactions are represented by reaction schemes , which in addition to starting materials and products show important intermediates or transition states .
also , some relatively minor additions to the reaction can be indicated above the reaction arrow ; examples of such additions are water , heat , illumination , a catalyst , etc .
similarly , some minor products can be placed below the arrow , often with a minus sign .
retrosynthetic analysis can be applied to design a complex synthesis reaction .
here the analysis starts from the products , for example by splitting selected chemical bonds , to arrive at plausible initial reagents .
a special arrow ( ⇒ ) is used in retro reactions .
the elementary reaction is the smallest division into which a chemical reaction can be decomposed , it has no intermediate products .
most experimentally observed reactions are built up from many elementary reactions that occur in parallel or sequentially .
the actual sequence of the individual elementary reactions is known as reaction mechanism .
an elementary reaction involves a few molecules , usually one or two , because of the low probability for several molecules to meet at a certain time .
the most important elementary reactions are unimolecular and bimolecular reactions .
only one molecule is involved in a unimolecular reaction ; it is transformed by an isomerization or a dissociation into one or more other molecules .
such reactions require the addition of energy in the form of heat or light .
a typical example of a unimolecular reaction is the cis–trans isomerization , in which the cis-form of a compound converts to the trans-form or vice versa .
in a typical dissociation reaction , a bond in a molecule splits ( ruptures ) resulting in two molecular fragments .
the splitting can be homolytic or heterolytic .
in the first case , the bond is divided so that each product retains an electron and becomes a neutral radical .
in the second case , both electrons of the chemical bond remain with one of the products , resulting in charged ions .
dissociation plays an important role in triggering chain reactions , such as hydrogen–oxygen or polymerization reactions .
for bimolecular reactions , two molecules collide and react with each other .
their merger is called chemical synthesis or an addition reaction .
another possibility is that only a portion of one molecule is transferred to the other molecule .
this type of reaction occurs , for example , in redox and acid-base reactions .
in redox reactions , the transferred particle is an electron , whereas in acid-base reactions it is a proton .
this type of reaction is also called metathesis .
for example most chemical reactions are reversible , that is they can and do run in both directions .
the forward and reverse reactions are competing with each other and differ in reaction rates .
these rates depend on the concentration and therefore change with time of the reaction : the reverse rate gradually increases and becomes equal to the rate of the forward reaction , establishing the so-called chemical equilibrium .
the time to reach equilibrium depends on such parameters as temperature , pressure and the materials involved , and is determined by the minimum free energy .
in equilibrium , the gibbs free energy must be zero .
the pressure dependence can be explained with the le chatelier's principle .
for example , an increase in pressure due to decreasing volume causes the reaction to shift to the side with the fewer moles of gas .
the reaction yield stabilizes at equilibrium , but can be increased by removing the product from the reaction mixture or changed by increasing the temperature or pressure .
a change in the concentrations of the reactants does not affect the equilibrium constant , but does affect the equilibrium position .
chemical reactions are determined by the laws of thermodynamics .
reactions can proceed by themselves if they are exergonic , that is if they release energy .
the associated free energy of the reaction is composed of two different thermodynamic quantities , enthalpy and entropy : reactions can be exothermic , where δh is negative and energy is released .
typical examples of exothermic reactions are precipitation and crystallization , in which ordered solids are formed from disordered gaseous or liquid phases .
in contrast , in endothermic reactions , heat is consumed from the environment .
this can occur by increasing the entropy of the system , often through the formation of gaseous reaction products , which have high entropy .
since the entropy increases with temperature , many endothermic reactions preferably take place at high temperatures .
on the contrary , many exothermic reactions such as crystallization occur at low temperatures .
changes in temperature can sometimes reverse the sign of the enthalpy of a reaction , as for the carbon monoxide reduction of molybdenum dioxide : this reaction to form carbon dioxide and molybdenum is endothermic at low temperatures , becoming less so with increasing temperature .
δh° is zero at , and the reaction becomes exothermic above that temperature .
changes in temperature can also reverse the direction tendency of a reaction .
for example , the water gas shift reaction is favored by low temperatures , but its reverse is favored by high temperature .
the shift in reaction direction tendency occurs at .
reactions can also be characterized by the internal energy which takes into account changes in the entropy , volume and chemical potential .
the latter depends , among other things , on the activities of the involved substances .
the speed at which reactions takes place is studied by reaction kinetics .
the rate depends on various parameters , such as : several theories allow calculating the reaction rates at the molecular level .
this field is referred to as reaction dynamics .
the rate " v " of a first-order reaction , which could be disintegration of a substance a , is given by : its integration yields : here k is first-order rate constant having dimension *num* / time , [ a ] ( t ) is concentration at a time " t " and [ a ] is the initial concentration .
the rate of a first-order reaction depends only on the concentration and the properties of the involved substance , and the reaction itself can be described with the characteristic half-life .
more than one time constant is needed when describing reactions of higher order .
the temperature dependence of the rate constant usually follows the arrhenius equation : where e is the activation energy and k is the boltzmann constant .
one of the simplest models of reaction rate is the collision theory .
more realistic models are tailored to a specific problem and include the transition state theory , the calculation of the potential energy surface , the marcus theory and the rice–ramsperger–kassel–marcus ( rrkm ) theory .
in a synthesis reaction , two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex substance .
these reactions are in the general form : two or more reactants yielding one product is another way to identify a synthesis reaction .
one example of a synthesis reaction is the combination of iron and sulfur to form iron ( ii ) sulfide : another example is simple hydrogen gas combined with simple oxygen gas to produce a more complex substance , such as water .
a decomposition reaction is when a more complex substance breaks down into its more simple parts .
it is thus the opposite of a synthesis reaction , and can be written as one example of a decomposition reaction is the electrolysis of water to make oxygen and hydrogen gas : in a single replacement reaction , a single uncombined element replaces another in a compound ; in other words , one element trades places with another element in a compound these reactions come in the general form of : one example of a single displacement reaction is when magnesium replaces hydrogen in water to make magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen gas : in a double replacement reaction , the anions and cations of two compounds switch places and form two entirely different compounds .
these reactions are in the general form : for example , when barium chloride ( bacl ) and magnesium sulfate ( mgso ) react , the so anion switches places with the 2cl anion , giving the compounds baso and mgcl .
another example of a double displacement reaction is the reaction of lead ( ii ) nitrate with potassium iodide to form lead ( ii ) iodide and potassium nitrate : redox reactions can be understood in terms of transfer of electrons from one involved species ( reducing agent ) to another ( oxidizing agent ) .
in this process , the former species is " oxidized " and the latter is " reduced " .
though sufficient for many purposes , these descriptions are not precisely correct .
oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation state , and reduction as a decrease in oxidation state .
in practice , the transfer of electrons will always change the oxidation state , but there are many reactions that are classed as " redox " even though no electron transfer occurs ( such as those involving covalent bonds ) .
in the following redox reaction , hazardous sodium metal reacts with toxic chlorine gas to form the ionic compound sodium chloride , or common table salt : in the reaction , sodium metal goes from an oxidation state of *num* ( as it is a pure element ) to +1 : in other words , the sodium lost one electron and is said to have been oxidized .
on the other hand , the chlorine gas goes from an oxidation of *num* ( it is also a pure element ) to −1 : the chlorine gains one electron and is said to have been reduced .
because the chlorine is the one reduced , it is considered the electron acceptor , or in other words , induces oxidation in the sodium – thus the chlorine gas is considered the oxidizing agent .
conversely , the sodium is oxidized or is the electron donor , and thus induces reduction in the other species and is considered the " reducing agent " .
which of the involved reactants would be reducing or oxidizing agent can be predicted from the electronegativity of their elements .
elements with low electronegativity , such as most metals , easily donate electrons and oxidize – they are reducing agents .
on the contrary , many ions with high oxidation numbers , such as , , , , can gain one or two extra electrons and are strong oxidizing agents .
the number of electrons donated or accepted in a redox reaction can be predicted from the electron configuration of the reactant element .
elements try to reach the low-energy noble gas configuration , and therefore alkali metals and halogens will donate and accept one electron respectively .
noble gases themselves are chemically inactive .
an important class of redox reactions are the electrochemical reactions , where electrons from the power supply are used as the reducing agent .
these reactions are particularly important for the production of chemical elements , such as chlorine or aluminium .
the reverse process in which electrons are released in redox reactions and can be used as electrical energy is possible and used in batteries .
in complexation reactions , several ligands react with a metal atom to form a coordination complex .
this is achieved by providing lone pairs of the ligand into empty orbitals of the metal atom and forming dipolar bonds .
the ligands are lewis bases , they can be both ions and neutral molecules , such as carbon monoxide , ammonia or water .
the number of ligands that react with a central metal atom can be found using the 18-electron rule , saying that the valence shells of a transition metal will collectively accommodate *num* electrons , whereas the symmetry of the resulting complex can be predicted with the crystal field theory and ligand field theory .
complexation reactions also include ligand exchange , in which one or more ligands are replaced by another , and redox processes which change the oxidation state of the central metal atom .
in the brønsted–lowry acid–base theory , an acid-base reaction involves a transfer of protons ( h ) from one species ( the acid ) to another ( the base ) .
when a proton is removed from an acid , the resulting species is termed that acid's conjugate base .
when the proton is accepted by a base , the resulting species is termed that base's conjugate acid .
in other words , acids act as proton donors and bases act as proton acceptors according to the following equation : the reverse reaction is possible , and thus the acid / base and conjugated base / acid are always in equilibrium .
the equilibrium is determined by the acid and base dissociation constants ( " k " and " k " ) of the involved substances .
a special case of the acid-base reaction is the neutralization where an acid and a base , taken at exactly same amounts , form a neutral salt .
acid-base reactions can have different definitions depending on the acid-base concept employed .
some of the most common are : precipitation is the formation of a solid in a solution or inside another solid during a chemical reaction .
it usually takes place when the concentration of dissolved ions exceeds the solubility limit and forms an insoluble salt .
this process can be assisted by adding a precipitating agent or by removal of the solvent .
rapid precipitation results in an amorphous or microcrystalline residue and slow process can yield single crystals .
the latter can also be obtained by recrystallization from microcrystalline salts .
reactions can take place between two solids .
however , because of the relatively small diffusion rates in solids , the corresponding chemical reactions are very slow in comparison to liquid and gas phase reactions .
they are accelerated by increasing the reaction temperature and finely dividing the reactant to increase the contacting surface area .
reaction can take place at the solid|gas interface , surfaces at very low pressure such as ultra-high vacuum .
via scanning tunneling microscopy , it is possible to observe reactions at the solid|gas interface in real space , if the time scale of the reaction is in the correct range .
reactions at the solid|gas interface are in some cases related to catalysis .
in photochemical reactions , atoms and molecules absorb energy ( photons ) of the illumination light and convert into an excited state .
they can then release this energy by breaking chemical bonds , thereby producing radicals .
photochemical reactions include hydrogen–oxygen reactions , radical polymerization , chain reactions and rearrangement reactions .
many important processes involve photochemistry .
the premier example is photosynthesis , in which most plants use solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose , disposing of oxygen as a side-product .
humans rely on photochemistry for the formation of vitamin d , and vision is initiated by a photochemical reaction of rhodopsin .
in fireflies , an enzyme in the abdomen catalyzes a reaction that results in bioluminescence .
many significant photochemical reactions , such as ozone formation , occur in the earth atmosphere and constitute atmospheric chemistry .
in catalysis , the reaction does not proceed directly , but through reaction with a third substance known as catalyst .
although the catalyst takes part in the reaction , it is returned to its original state by the end of the reaction and so is not consumed .
however , it can be inhibited , deactivated or destroyed by secondary processes .
catalysts can be used in a different phase ( heterogeneous ) or in the same phase ( homogeneous ) as the reactants .
in heterogeneous catalysis , typical secondary processes include coking where the catalyst becomes covered by polymeric side products .
additionally , heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid–liquid system or evaporate in a solid–gas system .
catalysts can only speed up the reaction – chemicals that slow down the reaction are called inhibitors .
substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters , and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic poisons .
with a catalyst , a reaction which is kinetically inhibited by a high activation energy can take place in circumvention of this activation energy .
heterogeneous catalysts are usually solids , powdered in order to maximize their surface area .
of particular importance in heterogeneous catalysis are the platinum group metals and other transition metals , which are used in hydrogenations , catalytic reforming and in the synthesis of commodity chemicals such as nitric acid and ammonia .
acids are an example of a homogeneous catalyst , they increase the nucleophilicity of carbonyls , allowing a reaction that would not otherwise proceed with electrophiles .
the advantage of homogeneous catalysts is the ease of mixing them with the reactants , but they may also be difficult to separate from the products .
therefore , heterogeneous catalysts are preferred in many industrial processes .
in organic chemistry , in addition to oxidation , reduction or acid-base reactions , a number of other reactions can take place which involve covalent bonds between carbon atoms or carbon and heteroatoms ( such as oxygen , nitrogen , halogens , etc .
) .
many specific reactions in organic chemistry are name reactions designated after their discoverers .
in a substitution reaction , a functional group in a particular chemical compound is replaced by another group .
these reactions can be distinguished by the type of substituting species into a nucleophilic , electrophilic or radical substitution .
in the first type , a nucleophile , an atom or molecule with an excess of electrons and thus a negative charge or partial charge , replaces another atom or part of the " substrate " molecule .
the electron pair from the nucleophile attacks the substrate forming a new bond , while the leaving group departs with an electron pair .
the nucleophile may be electrically neutral or negatively charged , whereas the substrate is typically neutral or positively charged .
examples of nucleophiles are hydroxide ion , alkoxides , amines and halides .
this type of reaction is found mainly in aliphatic hydrocarbons , and rarely in aromatic hydrocarbon .
the latter have high electron density and enter nucleophilic aromatic substitution only with very strong electron withdrawing groups .
nucleophilic substitution can take place by two different mechanisms , s1 and s2 .
in their names , s stands for substitution , n for nucleophilic , and the number represents the kinetic order of the reaction , unimolecular or bimolecular .
the s1 reaction proceeds in two steps .
first , the leaving group is eliminated creating a carbocation .
this is followed by a rapid reaction with the nucleophile .
in the s2 mechanism , the nucleophile forms a transition state with the attacked molecule , and only then the leaving group is cleaved .
these two mechanisms differ in the stereochemistry of the products .
s1 leads to the non-stereospecific addition and does not result in a chiral center , but rather in a set of geometric isomers ( " cis / trans " ) .
in contrast , a reversal ( walden inversion ) of the previously existing stereochemistry is observed in the s2 mechanism .
electrophilic substitution is the counterpart of the nucleophilic substitution in that the attacking atom or molecule , an electrophile , has low electron density and thus a positive charge .
typical electrophiles are the carbon atom of carbonyl groups , carbocations or sulfur or nitronium cations .
this reaction takes place almost exclusively in aromatic hydrocarbons , where it is called electrophilic aromatic substitution .
the electrophile attack results in the so-called σ-complex , a transition state in which the aromatic system is abolished .
then , the leaving group , usually a proton , is split off and the aromaticity is restored .
an alternative to aromatic substitution is electrophilic aliphatic substitution .
it is similar to the nucleophilic aliphatic substitution and also has two major types , s1 and s2 in the third type of substitution reaction , radical substitution , the attacking particle is a radical .
this process usually takes the form of a chain reaction , for example in the reaction of alkanes with halogens .
in the first step , light or heat disintegrates the halogen-containing molecules producing the radicals .
then the reaction proceeds as an avalanche until two radicals meet and recombine .
the addition and its counterpart , the elimination , are reactions which change the number of substituents on the carbon atom , and form or cleave multiple bonds .
double and triple bonds can be produced by eliminating a suitable leaving group .
similar to the nucleophilic substitution , there are several possible reaction mechanisms which are named after the respective reaction order .
in the e1 mechanism , the leaving group is ejected first , forming a carbocation .
the next step , formation of the double bond , takes place with elimination of a proton ( deprotonation ) .
the leaving order is reversed in the e1cb mechanism , that is the proton is split off first .
this mechanism requires participation of a base .
because of the similar conditions , both reactions in the e1 or e1cb elimination always compete with the s1 substitution .
the e2 mechanism also requires a base , but there the attack of the base and the elimination of the leaving group proceed simultaneously and produce no ionic intermediate .
in contrast to the e1 eliminations , different stereochemical configurations are possible for the reaction product in the e2 mechanism , because the attack of the base preferentially occurs in the anti-position with respect to the leaving group .
because of the similar conditions and reagents , the e2 elimination is always in competition with the s2-substitution .
the counterpart of elimination is the addition where double or triple bonds are converted into single bonds .
similar to the substitution reactions , there are several types of additions distinguished by the type of the attacking particle .
for example , in the electrophilic addition of hydrogen bromide , an electrophile ( proton ) attacks the double bond forming a carbocation , which then reacts with the nucleophile ( bromine ) .
the carbocation can be formed on either side of the double bond depending on the groups attached to its ends , and the preferred configuration can be predicted with the markovnikov's rule .
this rule states that " in the heterolytic addition of a polar molecule to an alkene or alkyne , the more electronegative ( nucleophilic ) atom ( or part ) of the polar molecule becomes attached to the carbon atom bearing the smaller number of hydrogen atoms .
" if the addition of a functional group takes place at the less substituted carbon atom of the double bond , then the electrophilic substitution with acids is not possible .
in this case , one has to use the hydroboration–oxidation reaction , where in the first step , the boron atom acts as electrophile and adds to the less substituted carbon atom .
at the second step , the nucleophilic hydroperoxide or halogen anion attacks the boron atom .
while the addition to the electron-rich alkenes and alkynes is mainly electrophilic , the nucleophilic addition plays an important role for the carbon-heteroatom multiple bonds , and especially its most important representative , the carbonyl group .
this process is often associated with an elimination , so that after the reaction the carbonyl group is present again .
it is therefore called addition-elimination reaction and may occur in carboxylic acid derivatives such as chlorides , esters or anhydrides .
this reaction is often catalyzed by acids or bases , where the acids increase by the electrophilicity of the carbonyl group by binding to the oxygen atom , whereas the bases enhance the nucleophilicity of the attacking nucleophile .
nucleophilic addition of a carbanion or another nucleophile to the double bond of an alpha , beta unsaturated carbonyl compound can proceed via the michael reaction , which belongs to the larger class of conjugate additions .
this is one of the most useful methods for the mild formation of c–c bonds .
some additions which can not be executed with nucleophiles and electrophiles , can be succeeded with free radicals .
as with the free-radical substitution , the radical addition proceeds as a chain reaction , and such reactions are the basis of the free-radical polymerization .
in a rearrangement reaction , the carbon skeleton of a molecule is rearranged to give a structural isomer of the original molecule .
these include hydride shift reactions such as the wagner-meerwein rearrangement , where a hydrogen , alkyl or aryl group migrates from one carbon to a neighboring carbon .
most rearrangements are associated with the breaking and formation of new carbon-carbon bonds .
other examples are sigmatropic reaction such as the cope rearrangement .
cyclic rearrangements include cycloadditions and , more generally , pericyclic reactions , wherein two or more double bond-containing molecules form a cyclic molecule .
an important example of cycloaddition reaction is the diels–alder reaction ( the so-called [ 4+2 ] cycloaddition ) between a conjugated diene and a substituted alkene to form a substituted cyclohexene system .
whether a certain cycloaddition would proceed depends on the electronic orbitals of the participating species , as only orbitals with the same sign of wave function will overlap and interact constructively to form new bonds .
cycloaddition is usually assisted by light or heat .
these perturbations result in different arrangement of electrons in the excited state of the involved molecules and therefore in different effects .
for example , the [ 4+2 ] diels-alder reactions can be assisted by heat whereas the [ 2+2 ] cycloaddition is selectively induced by light .
because of the orbital character , the potential for developing stereoisomeric products upon cycloaddition is limited , as described by the woodward–hoffmann rules .
biochemical reactions are mainly controlled by enzymes .
these proteins can specifically catalyze a single reaction , so that reactions can be controlled very precisely .
the reaction takes place in the active site , a small part of the enzyme which is usually found in a cleft or pocket lined by amino acid residues , and the rest of the enzyme is used mainly for stabilization .
the catalytic action of enzymes relies on several mechanisms including the molecular shape ( " induced fit " ) , bond strain , proximity and orientation of molecules relative to the enzyme , proton donation or withdrawal ( acid / base catalysis ) , electrostatic interactions and many others .
the biochemical reactions that occur in living organisms are collectively known as metabolism .
among the most important of its mechanisms is the anabolism , in which different dna and enzyme-controlled processes result in the production of large molecules such as proteins and carbohydrates from smaller units .
bioenergetics studies the sources of energy for such reactions .
an important energy source is glucose , which can be produced by plants via photosynthesis or assimilated from food .
all organisms use this energy to produce adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) , which can then be used to energize other reactions .
chemical reactions are central to chemical engineering where they are used for the synthesis of new compounds from natural raw materials such as petroleum and mineral ores .
it is essential to make the reaction as efficient as possible , maximizing the yield and minimizing the amount of reagents , energy inputs and waste .
catalysts are especially helpful for reducing the energy required for the reaction and increasing its reaction rate .
some specific reactions have their niche applications .
for example , the thermite reaction is used to generate light and heat in pyrotechnics and welding .
although it is less controllable than the more conventional oxy-fuel welding , arc welding and flash welding , it requires much less equipment and is still used to mend rails , especially in remote areas .
mechanisms of monitoring chemical reactions depend strongly on the reaction rate .
relatively slow processes can be analyzed in situ for the concentrations and identities of the individual ingredients .
important tools of real time analysis are the measurement of ph and analysis of optical absorption ( color ) and emission spectra .
a less accessible but rather efficient method is introduction of a radioactive isotope into the reaction and monitoring how it changes over time and where it moves to ; this method is often used to analyze redistribution of substances in the human body .
faster reactions are usually studied with ultrafast laser spectroscopy where utilization of femtosecond lasers allows short-lived transition states to be monitored at time scaled down to a few femtoseconds .
